	schema:reviewBody "I heard of this movie before but I had no knowledge of what it was about and basically rented it because it looked good and Robert DeNiro is the starmy Number One favorite actor.  Well DeNiro's performance is one of the high points of the film and he is extraordinary as the abusive father who seems pleasant and jovial at times but can turn violent when you push his buttons.  Leonardo DiCaprio is also great in one of the best performances of his career.  Over the years he's been gaining a reputation as a glamour guy.  And that he is but you must see his performance in this movie before regarding him as just another pretty face.  He was still in his early teens I'm guessing when he made this film so this was a long time before he hit it big with Titanic. Ellen Barkin is also good but I wish her character could've been developed a little more.  I kept wondering during the course of the film why she felt like withstanding Dwight's abuse for such a long period of time.  In the beginning of the film she's established as a free spiritthe kind of woman that romances a man then drives off to another state to find her next man.  Well why didn't she do the same thing with this jerk?  The film is based on a true story so I'm sure she really did stay with him that long but I just wanted to know her motives.  This Boy's Life is a solid beautifully made sliceoflife that kept me glued to the screen from start to finish.  The climax is an emotional powerhouse that made me want to stand up and cheer.  Please check out this underrated masterpiece!  My score  9 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Although I didn't live there during the time the movie was made I did venture up one afternoon to see what the town looked like as a movie set. Remarkably the town looked much like I remembered from my childhood in the 60's and it was a nice journey back in time. While living in Arizona '922001 I would frequently watch the movie when I was homesick I enjoyed seeing my old town my old schools  the surrounding scenic shots. I am now living back in Concrete and sadly the town has wasted away to nothing but with This Boy's Life I can go back for an hour or so to when it was a really great place to live and growup. The reallife Dwight has since died everyone who knew him says he was just like book and movie portrayed him and his real kids dispute the fact that he was an abusive father. Tobias Wolff is of course now a wellknown writer but remembered as a nice funloving kid who did pretty well weathering the constant stress at home while growing up. A number of Concrete residents still resent the portrayal of our town as a backwoods redneck community that harbors childabusers. Unfortunately the truth hurts  that description pretty much sums up our little spot on the map. But we do have some of the most beautiful scenery in the world lots of fresh air and no gangs so I guess we are better off than a lot of urban environments. Leo DiCaprio did a great job in his role. Ellen Barkin was memorable but I had a hard time feeling much empathy for her character. DiNiro was  well...DiNiro. Every role he touches becomes gold and this one will shine for a long time. This movie was highly underrated in my opinion and not just because I was biased and should have gotten more notice after it's release. You can still see it on the pay channels occasionally on cable networks and of course video  DVD. The sets clothing and music really do justice to the time. See it and you will never forget it! small tidbit on my trip up to Concrete to visit the set I was happened upon DiNiro DiCaprio  Barkin filming the scene where they were driving for the first time into Concrete. The local sheriff had closed off the highway until the scene was completed but because I knew the area and side rural roads I sneaked up to a spot where I could videotape the car with the three inside going down the highway. I DID get decent video of DiNiro driving the car and was thrilled!".

	schema:reviewBody "This Boy's Life was the break out role for Leonardo DiCaprio who proved what a great talent he was in this coming of age film. He had to be to hold his own with Robert DeNiro. DeNiro with his great ear for voices and accents perfectly captures the role of stepfather Dwight Hansen a man with a terrible inferiority complex who takes it out on his stepson.The film is based on the memoirs of writer Tobias Wolff as he and his mother endured five years of hell with this very provincial man who is trapped in the small town mentality of Concrete Washington during the 1950s. The title quote is from DeNiro who repeats that line many times during the film. In fact that's all he does is talk in clichs and it's made abundantly clear that his level of ignorance about the outside world is frightening.That puts him in contrast with stepson DiCaprio who's a bright kid and capable of going places with some guidance. DeNiro isn't about to provide that guidance he's just plain jealous of him.In fact This Boy's Life is similar in that respect to the Tom Cruise film All the Right Moves where Cruise is also trying to escape the drab life he sees in his small Pennsylvania mining town through athletics and meets with jealousy from many around him but not in his own family circle.This Boy's Life should be required viewing on the effects of homophobia. In addition to the principal players DeNiro DiCaprio and Ellen Barkin as DiCaprio's mother credit should go to Jonah Blechman who played gay teen Arthur Gayle. He's got a real lonely existence in Concrete Washington. Arthur's story is still unfortunately being acted out today in thousands of small town throughout the USA. He gravitates to DiCaprio not just sexually but because he recognizes a kindred spirit there.Among other things DeNiro encourages is homophobia as homosexuality is one of many things he's ignorant about and prefers to remain so. It's quite a scene in which DeNiro encourages DiCaprio to beat up Arthur on any and all occasions.In fact that's ultimately Dwight's problem. It's maybe ONLY two things that he knows anything about and can converse intelligently on. And he's living in a town full of other Dwights as ignorant as he is.This is one of the best films of the last decade of the last century and should not be missed.".

	schema:headline " Memorable But Difficult To Watch";
	schema:reviewBody "This was a very haunting sometimes very difficult story to watch unfold on screen. It was one of the first films I recollect seeing when I went berserk collecting tons of VHS tapes in the mid90s. I had never heard of Leonardo DiCaprio but I'm just I wasn't alone as this was his second or third time on screen. Anyway he certainly gave a powerful performance and served notice he was going to be a big name actor.Basically it's about teenage kid and his mom trying to survive the mean fatherhusband of the family in a small town during the 1950s. Robert De Niro plays the dad and Ellen Barkin the mom. This may be the only film I've seen in which Barkin actually played the nicest person of the leads!! Leo plays Tobias Wolffe De Niro Dwight Hansen and Barkin Caroline Hansen. She had remarried Hansen after having Toby earlier hence the surname Wolffe.What made this story tough for me was that to be honest neither father nor son were nice guys although De Niro's character was far worse. The struggles  and that's putting it tactfully  between father and son were really nasty. Yet as unpleasant at is the story is memorable and it haunted me for several days especially since it is based on a true story. How much of this was true I can't say but it is a dramatic story you will not dismiss. However watching dysfunctional families and hearing a lot of verbal abuse is not fun so be warned.".

	schema:headline " A splendidly unnerving analysis of family dysfunction";
	schema:reviewBody "When the words This Boy's Life and Based on a true story appeared within the first few seconds of this movie I was almost tempted to switch off. Because it looked like something I'd seen in many a TV movie. And I hate TV movies. I've got a real personal bias against them. Because they're so predictable. They dot every i. Cross every t. And they're need for sentiment is nauseating. I was expecting very much the same of This Boy's Life.But then when I saw Robert De Niro's name on the credits that gave me pause for thought. So I decided to stay with the film a little while longer. And was pleasantly surprised.This Boy's Life is a quite compelling portrait of a family on the verge of flying apart. There's not only a strong commanding performance from Robert De Niro but an impressively assured one from a young and then unknown Leonardo DiCaprio.DiCaprio plays Tobias 'Toby' Wolff a rebellious teen of the 1950s. After heading South with his mother Caroline Ellen Barkin they wind up in the charmingly titled Concrete USA.Hoping for a fresh start after breaking up with an abusive boyfriend Caroline gets involved with Dwight Hansen De Niro. The man is an obvious snakeoil salesman. He flatters Caroline constantly. Dazzling her with the use of a lighter. Complimenting her on her Java. And Toby sees right through him.Toby knows Dwight is as useless a father and husband as he is a human being. But Caroline is so desperate to marry into a happier life that it isn't long before she foolishly gets hitched to him. And that's when the trouble starts.Dwight is a bully. Pure and simple. He enjoys antagonising Toby. Beating up on him. Hoarding his paper route money away for a rainy day. And all because he's trying to make a man of him. Or so Dwight says.I suppose This Boy's Life isn't terribly original nor does it do anything strikingly different with the theme of fractured families. But the performances from the excellent cast goes some way towards making up for that.When I did see Robert De Niro on the credits on the one hand it enlivened my original flagging spirits but on the other I proceeded into the film with caution.I'd just recently watched De Niro in Cape Fear a film that contains one of his worst ever performances. A performance so annoyingly over the top he lost all credibility in the role. Even now 16 years later I still can't watch that film without cringing.So it was something of a relief to see him revert to form in This Boy's Life. He mostly resists the temptation to go overboard and thoroughly convinces as an abusive bully.Dwight is quite fascinating to watch. This is a man who feels terminally put upon. He's the victim here. The one who's been shortchanged throughout all his life. He's been left to raise three kids alone. As well as a stepson. His dreams have never come to fruition. So he sees nothing wrong with thwarting the dreams of those around him. Including Toby's.In his breakout role Leonardo DiCaprio works wonders. He brings a superb eagleeyed maturity to Toby. Interesting considering he doesn't always have that quality in some of his later films. But here he's got this character nailed. The way he rotates from frustrated to rebellious and rare moments of happiness is just marvellous.De Niro is careful too the way he shows to us what a thoroughly reprehensible monster he is. Like the little glance he gives us when he learns Caroline's a better shot than him. And then once they're married his grip closes like a vice allowing him to cut loose. He does occasionally lapse into some borderline theatrics but it doesn't ruin the film the way it did Cape Fear.The ending is quite satisfying too. The inevitable confrontation between Dwight and Toby. I was half expecting it to devolve into a standard psychothriller but This Boy's Life is too smart for that. It's still quite violent but its an ending that feels true to life. Dwight's pleas at the end sound so pathetic you feel as much pity for him as you do derision.This Boy's Life is definitely worthwhile. Its a wonderful showcase of emotion for Leonardo DiCaprio. Shows you what a great actor he can be when given the right material to work with. And its a surprisingly complex portrait of a thug who felt misrepresented all his life.".

Every time De Niro is on screen he always creates tension and hatred for his character of Dwight. And always makes you feel sorry for Di Caprio which he also plays brilliantly. With Ellen Barkin caught up in the middle of it all the film tells us the story of Di Caprio's character Toby Woolf and his trouble with his mums boyfriend De Niro with this film being made in 1993 this is when De Niro was at the top of his game as an Actor and you would think makes it harder for Di Caprio to compete with on screen but it doesn't. Leonardo competes perfectly within his character and is just as memorable as De Niro throughout the film and is somewhat even better on screen seeing the actor that he has become today.

	schema:reviewBody "Tobias Leonardo DiCaprio and his mother Caroline Ellen Barkin are at loose ends after Caroline's divorce. Caroline has the get rich scheme of heading for uranium mining out west. After this and other other ideas fail Caroline and Tobias wind up in Concrete Washington yes it actually exists where they are getting desperate. In steps Dwight a local mechanic. Dwight seems sincere in his courting of Caroline and since he offers stability and security Caroline is willing to buy what he is offering by marrying him. After the marriage Dwight's dark side surfaces in the major conflict that develops between him and Tobias. Tobias is no angel but to me his behavior was no more out of line than that of your typical rebellious youth whereas Dwight's tyrannical behavior struck me as bordering on the sadistic. The scenes of physical abuse I found hard to watch.Why Dwight's reaction to Tobias is so extreme is open to speculation. In part I think it comes from Dwight's perception of what it means to be a manyou are the ultimate authority one who brooks no opposition. Expanding on that theme Dwight senses that Tobias is not living up to his stereotypical image for example Tobias likes to read books of all things. In some ways I got the feeling that Dwight's behavior was not all malicious some small part of him felt for Tobias and he was trying to impose his vision on him as how to deal with the world. However there is one pivotal scene that said a lot about Dwight to me. While Dwight and Tobias were watching television a news report came on about Lana Turner's daughter Cheryl Crane murdering Turner's boyfriend Johnny Stompanato on the grounds that he was brutalizing her mother. Crane was acquitted on the grounds of justifiable homicide. When that last piece of information was mentioned Dwight looked over at Tobias who was paying intense attention to the program with a look that said Hmmmm could this apply to me? This indicated to me that Dwight knew he had gone over the line in his dealings with Tobias and maybe would pay the ultimate price.The movie takes place in the late 1950s and period details are inserted in order to make that point cars hair styles clothes TV movies music.De Niro is good hereI think you have to be a good actor to play such a thoroughly unlikeable bully as Dwight with such convincing realism.

	onyx:emotionText "Tobias Leonardo DiCaprio and his mother Caroline Ellen Barkin are at loose ends after Caroline's divorce. Caroline has the get rich scheme of heading for uranium mining out west. After this and other other ideas fail Caroline and Tobias wind up in Concrete Washington yes it actually exists where they are getting desperate. In steps Dwight a local mechanic. Dwight seems sincere in his courting of Caroline and since he offers stability and security Caroline is willing to buy what he is offering by marrying him. After the marriage Dwight's dark side surfaces in the major conflict that develops between him and Tobias. Tobias is no angel but to me his behavior was no more out of line than that of your typical rebellious youth whereas Dwight's tyrannical behavior struck me as bordering on the sadistic. The scenes of physical abuse I found hard to watch.Why Dwight's reaction to Tobias is so extreme is open to speculation. In part I think it comes from Dwight's perception of what it means to be a manyou are the ultimate authority one who brooks no opposition. Expanding on that theme Dwight senses that Tobias is not living up to his stereotypical image for example Tobias likes to read books of all things. In some ways I got the feeling that Dwight's behavior was not all malicious some small part of him felt for Tobias and he was trying to impose his vision on him as how to deal with the world. However there is one pivotal scene that said a lot about Dwight to me. While Dwight and Tobias were watching television a news report came on about Lana Turner's daughter Cheryl Crane murdering Turner's boyfriend Johnny Stompanato on the grounds that he was brutalizing her mother. Crane was acquitted on the grounds of justifiable homicide. When that last piece of information was mentioned Dwight looked over at Tobias who was paying intense attention to the program with a look that said Hmmmm could this apply to me? This indicated to me that Dwight knew he had gone over the line in his dealings with Tobias and maybe would pay the ultimate price.The movie takes place in the late 1950s and period details are inserted in order to make that point cars hair styles clothes TV movies music.De Niro is good hereI think you have to be a good actor to play such a thoroughly unlikeable bully as Dwight with such convincing realism. It is no small treat to see De Niro dressed in a scout uniform. Barkin is fine but Caroline moves to deep background once the major struggle between Dwight and Tobias takes center stage. DiCaprio turns in a particularly good performance being able to hold his own against two experienced actors.This is billed as a true story being an accounting of author Tobias Wollf's experiences.

It could make you not even want to see the movie. That being said this movie is a total gem! It was a boring hot sunny afternoon and there was absolutely nothing to watch on television. I was literally flipping through channels when somewhere along the line I decided that a slow paced uncomfortable movie about child abuse on Showcase would do. I soon realized that the child being abused was Leonardo DiCaprio and the person doing the abusing was none other than Robert De Niro. This movie is pretty much non stop action and by action I mean child abuse. If you hate Robert De Niro this may not be a good movie for you to watch because it will make you hate him even more. This Boy's Life is an incredibly thorough movie all the main groups of abuse are represented emotional physical psychological and even financial abuses are present throughout. One of the best scenes is when Robert De Niro crams an old mustard jar into Leonardo DiCaprio's eye to teach him a lesson about wasting condiments. This movie has it all sad drunk driving awkward gay teens and a bulldog!The sad fact is this movie is actually based on a true story. But I prefer to forget that and just enjoy the ride.".

The Basketball Diaries and this onehe had a promise not quite seen since James Dean whom bad luck prevented from going beyond his own early promise.DiCaprio is excellent here as a frustrated teenage stepson to DeNiro's petty and jealous stepfather. Ellen Barkin holds her own between them but how quickly she went from a teen bride in Diner to a romantic lead in The Big Easy to the mother of a teenager in This Boy's Life! Hollywood devours actresses. One forgets how powerless kids are to the parents who keep them fed. Watch DiCaprio trying to play high school basketball in slippery cordovans because DeNiro won't buy him sneakers. Watch his frustration in learning that DeNiro has traded his rifle for a dog he doesn't want. Watch his rebellion in sneaking off in DeNiro's car singing to the car radio man does that bring back memories and later his attempts at being cool with his buddies. smoking cigarettes and sporting a DA haircut like they do. Watch him in fact throughout.But for all that he's not a whit better than DeNiro in this movie. First of all DeNiro has adopted an accent far removed from his gangster roles with flat vowels and a whining drawl. And he's not a totally unsympathetic character just a petty bully with a taste for Perry Como. A final scene where he challenges DiCaprio with a notquiteempty mustard jar perfectly captures his smallness. And if we haven't already guessed that DeNiro is a supremely disappointed man it's made clear when DiCaprio finally finagles a prep school scholarship and actually leaves his mother too. How about me? DeNiro shouts at their backs. When is it my turn?A couple of shortcomings It's never really made clear the relationship between DeNiro and his two daughters by his first marriage. They don't develop at all. And also there's a brief and unnecessary sex scene between DeNiro and Barkin that shows his minor kink.

	schema:reviewBody "A few years ago when it was cool to hate Titanic I picked mercilessly on Leonardo DiCaprio as all males at the time did. I criticized his performances in every film I saw mainly Titanic. Even though I liked the film if you were a guy and admitted to enjoying it you were automatically labeled gay.Over the years I found new respect for DiCaprio as an actor. After I saw him in Catch Me If You Can I realized he had a great deal of natural talent and was striving to abandon his pretty boy roots. Then I saw Gangs of New York and felt he was strangely miscast.Going back to This Boy's Life we catch an early glimpse of DiCaprio and one of his finest performances to date. He is totally convincing in this film set in the 1950s based on a true story.Unfortunately the rest of the movie is not so lucky. The typically reliable Robert De Niro delivers one of his worst performances ever as a crazy kook from Seattle named Dwight who falls for Toby's DiCaprio mother Caroline played by Ellen Barkin.I applaud De Niro's recent ventures into comedy and disagree with the critics who claim he has sold out. But his performance in This Boy's Life is simply unacceptable. It starts out fine enough and his Seattle accent is impressive. But as the film progresses he turns into a strange comical character he is supposed to be scary and intimidating but he is neither.I feel the greatest flaw of this film centers around De Niro's character and performance. First of all Toby Leo acts like a jerk. We don't find much sympathy for him. When he falls into the hands of Dwight we eventually feel a bit of sympathy but because Dwight never seems very cruel or scary it's hard even then.There have been some very good child abuse movies made in the past. Radio Flyer was not a great movie by any means but by portraying child abuse through the eyes of a child and portraying the guilty as a truly cruel human being it succeeded and made us feel for the boys.This Boy's Life doesn't work because it's a bit too sarcastic knowing and selfassured. De Niro is not scary. In fact many times I agreed with his character. He rarely abused Toby in the film anyway and at many times even though he was drunk offered good advice.And the scenes such as the one in which he steals Toby's boy scout outfit aren't upsetting. They're humorous. It's hard to find fear and sympathy for a boy when we're laughing at his plights.The ending was the icing on the cake as far as I'm concerned. Throughout De Niro had managed to retain some level of dignity and realism but at the end he just let loose and turned into a screaming howling crybaby of a man obsessive paranoid and crazy. And he's still not scary because he's so pathetic that we're laughing at him. And by then the accent has become so corny and the dialogue and happyface gestures so hysterical that the film totally negates whatever its point was and becomes a halfhearted bittersweet comedy with a great performance by Leonardo DiCaprio and unimpressive elements elsewhere.Overall This Boy's Life is a mixed bag of a film that doesn't know whether to find sympathy for Tobias Wolff or humor in his situations. If you're a fan of the actors give it a go otherwise I recommend Radio Flyer.".

Ellen Barkin is exceptionally good as the clueless yet likable Mother. She may make you wanna slap her one at times but you'll lover her for the most part i'm sure.

	schema:reviewBody "Concrete Washington is the setting for this adaptation of Tobias Woolf's memoir 'This Boy's Life' and Robert de Niro is the stepdad from hell a man incapable of standing any competition in any aspect of life. But it's a fairly standard comingofage drama with a vaguely nostalgic air heavy on the period details. De Niro's character should be either frightening or funny but in the end comes across as merely pathetic the eventual realisation of this by the other characters provides the pivot to the story but unfortunately we the audience realise this much sooner than they do. Perhaps the problem is that 45 years ago behaviour such as his was normal so today we struggle to relate to it as people would then we can't understand why the more heroic characters tolerate it. But another part of the problem is that the memoir format hampers the story from living in the here and now we know the author played here by Leonardo Di Caprio survived and became a famous writer to boot so it's hard to impart a sense of life or death urgency to what we see the happy ending after the hardship is booked in advance. Finally the story's eventual resolution seems semirandom this may have been how it happened but when the boy wins a school scholarship there's been little before to indicate that this might happen.

	onyx:emotionText "Concrete Washington is the setting for this adaptation of Tobias Woolf's memoir 'This Boy's Life' and Robert de Niro is the stepdad from hell a man incapable of standing any competition in any aspect of life. But it's a fairly standard comingofage drama with a vaguely nostalgic air heavy on the period details. De Niro's character should be either frightening or funny but in the end comes across as merely pathetic the eventual realisation of this by the other characters provides the pivot to the story but unfortunately we the audience realise this much sooner than they do. Perhaps the problem is that 45 years ago behaviour such as his was normal so today we struggle to relate to it as people would then we can't understand why the more heroic characters tolerate it. But another part of the problem is that the memoir format hampers the story from living in the here and now we know the author played here by Leonardo Di Caprio survived and became a famous writer to boot so it's hard to impart a sense of life or death urgency to what we see the happy ending after the hardship is booked in advance. Finally the story's eventual resolution seems semirandom this may have been how it happened but when the boy wins a school scholarship there's been little before to indicate that this might happen. The result is a dull tale which is a shame with a little more immediacy and a little less comfortable framing the struggle between de Niro and di Caprio could have been great.";

I was impressed with him and especially in Gilbert Grape. I think for his age at the time he carried his role well to play a kid tormented by a truly disturbed and oh so abusive step father played far too well by DeNiro. I hope DeNiro doesn't share the qualities of his character in real life. He did a good job and that's what a good movie is all about. Movies that imitate real life along with good acting produces good reviews and ticket sales to me. But like I said I'm not dying to see it again.".

I also ponder upon a question why movies like This Boy's Life don't hit the big screen anymore? When did film making become a shallow business with it's only interest in profits.This Boy's Life is anything but a classic Hollywood blockbuster. It's a slice of life presented both in it's best and worst. And life is not like a film either... Being young smart and trapped in a behindhand environment is tough often frustrating and inhibiting. It's a first major battle in a war called survival a battle that would set a young man on it's way and pave the road to his future. Being alone in such a struggle is not easy and young Toby Wolff would feel it on his skin quite some. Well maybe not completely alone. Toby's mother tries hard to soldier on in life and yet she lacks the energy and will to make that final push. In the absence of a father figure fourteen year old Tobias endeavors to model himself on his own fighting not only his inner demons but also a harsh inert and primitive surrounding portrayed in the character of Dwigh and the village of Concrete. Will he succeed and break away? It's all in his hands...The entire cast made a remarkable job  Di Caprio for one followed by Ellen Barkin and Robert De Niro as well as rest of the team. A tribute would also deservedly go to all of the technical crew scriptwriter and director. Even without the reallife reference at the end it's quite obvious this story was written by life itself which makes it that special and unique. This Boy's Life is a good story well portrayed and as such it rightfully earns it's 10 points. More flicks like this please!This also presents a small jubilee since it is my 50th review here on IMDb including the needlessly removed one. Cheers!".

Alerted to the downstairs gunshot noise Sledge descends in the saloon pretending he's drunk catches the two gamblers unprepared and shoots them dead. An old man who witnessed the shooting offers to serve as Sledge's witness and swear it was selfdefense in case of an inquiry. The next day Sledge leaves town to meet with the rest of his gang in the hills. He notices the old man from the saloon following him on horseback some distance away. Sledge stops the old man and asks him why he is following behind. The old man explains that he is not following Sledge but rather a convoy escorting a gold shipment.

However having always respected Howard Hughes' Essentials book this was one of the few films that he had covered so far that I had not seen  and his recommendations had generally not disappointed. I am really glad that I did dispel these initial reservations because Man Called Sledge makes great viewing from beginning to end.Luther Sledge Garner is introduced to us as he enters a bar with one of his cohorts. Leaving his colleague to participate in an illfated card game Sledge reunites himself with his lover Ria Laura Antonelli. After a night of passion lucky man! he is woken by the sound of a gunshot. He returns to the bar to find his partner dead and forced to defend himself against the killers. An old timer witness John Marley confirms that Sledge has merely defended himself.Sledge and the old timer soon cross paths again with the former assuming that he is being tracked due to the price on his head. However it soon transpires that the old man has been spying on a delivery of gold. This gold is transported by a posse of armed guards and stored in a top security prison overnight. The old man recounts how he spent time in the jail with his cell sitting side by side to the safe.The lure of the gold is too much for Sledge and he is soon devising a scheme to get his hands on the horde and allow him to settle down and lead an honest life with Ria. And what better way to get access to the treasure than to find ones self imprisoned in the jail......A simple yet highly enjoyable idea for a story with double crossing aplenty and a cracking soundtrack. If truth be told I am still not completely sold on Messrs Garner and Weaver in the spaghetti genre but the film itself more than makes up for such minor grumbles. There are some great scenes with Sledge's wilful imprisonment with some very shady characters forming his prison mates a particular highlight.Highlighly recommended and grasping at a possible must view berth.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Man Called Sledge is unique among the spaghetti westerns I have seen so far because it is the only one directed by an American. Vic Morrow must have been a big fan of spaghetti westerns himself because he really got it right. It must have been a lot of fun for an American director to go to Spain and Italy to shoot an authentic spaghetti western back when the genre was still being pumped out.I wasn't expecting much spaghetti style from this film because I knew it was by an American director with mainly American actors but the movie really surprised me. It's nowhere near the very top of the spaghetti meter but on the other hand you would never mistake this one for a Hollywood western. It's got Italian written all over it. The music score by Gianni Ferrio is quite good. A couple of parts sound a little too much like jazz for me but most of it is wellsuited for the genre especially the tunes with vocals and overthetop cheesy lyrics.Don't let the fact that this movie is one of the laterera spaghetti westerns and has James Garner in it fool you into thinking it's one of those goofy comedy type of Eurowesterns. There are a couple of funny lines in the film but overall it's very serious and tragic with plenty of violence and action. This is not a happy film at all which is definitely a good thing in this case.The production values and acting are aboveaverage for a Eurowestern. James Garner and Dennis Weaver both of whom have usually portrayed happyfunny dogooders in American films and television shows do an excellent job here in their roles as seriously bad people. Casting them for those parts was probably done for effect. It reminds me of how Leone used Henry Fonda as the evil character in Once Upon a Time in the West.This is one that is definitely worth seeing if you are into Eurowesterns.".

	onyx:emotionText "A Man Called Sledge is unique among the spaghetti westerns I have seen so far because it is the only one directed by an American. Vic Morrow must have been a big fan of spaghetti westerns himself because he really got it right. It must have been a lot of fun for an American director to go to Spain and Italy to shoot an authentic spaghetti western back when the genre was still being pumped out.I wasn't expecting much spaghetti style from this film because I knew it was by an American director with mainly American actors but the movie really surprised me.

Vic Morrow's spaghetti western probably won't be making too many top ten lists but its an agreeable flick . It's an exciting western that scrutinizes the greed and paranoia that afflicts a misfit group  including breathtaking showdown between protagonists and the enemies . The film blends violence  thrills  high bodycount and it's fast moving and exciting . There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing shootouts or stunts every few minutes  including a spectacular final confrontation . Although by many to be director Vic Morrow's finest film  this is a tale of fear  greed and murder  as some partners fall out over the gold they have robbed from an impenetrable safe . It also has probably the most brutal prison escape ever put on film . Underrrated by some reviewers  but till interesting to watch . It above all things mostly also remains a real characters movie in which the five main roles are the essentials . Their dynamic together is also great and is what mostly keeps this movie going. They are five totally different characters which is the foremost reason why they work out so great together on film . This theme about confrontation among mean people for a cache of gold has been treated in various Spaghetti such as Ruthless four by Giorgo Capitani with Van Heflin  Gilbert Roland  George Hilton  and A reason to live  a reason to die by Tonino Valeri with James Coburn  Jose Suarez and Bud Spencer . Here James Garner is superbly believable and gives a nice portrait of an increasingly unhinged thief . James Garner enthusiasts might be surprised to see the star play a villain . Furthermore  John Marley is very good as a cunning old man and remaining support cast is pretty well . There appears Spaghetti's ordinary actors such as Ken Clark  Wayde Preston  Steffen Zacharias  Fausto Tozzi  Bruno Corazzari  Angelo Infanti  Luciano Rossi  Barta Barry  among others.The musician Gianni Ferrio composes a vibrant soundtrack and well conducted  including a catching leitmotif and considered to be one of the best . In addition  a marvelous song at the beginning titled Other men's gold  with lyrics by Bill Martin and Phil Coulter  sung by Stefan Grossman . Atmospheric scenario with barren outdoors  dirty landscapes under sunny exteriors and a shimmer sun and fine sets by production designer Mario Chiari with striking cinematography by Luigi Kuiveiller . The picture resulted to be shot entirely on location in Almeria  Spain  where in the 60s and 70s had been shot innumerable RavioliPaella Westerns  and interiors in Dino De Laurentiis Cinematographica S.A.  Rome . The motion picture was well written by Frank Kowalski ad Vic Morrow who also directed . While Morrow was filming Twilight zone  the movie  he was unfortunately killed on the early morning hours of July 23 1982 in a tragic freak accident on the set while filming a scene involving a helicopter which crashed right on top of him and two young children .

Of how men fought and died but not for glory only for gold. Gold was their god gold was their guide For it they lived for it they lied And my friends for gold they died.Seven men dreamed of holding fortunes in gold Gold that would make them rich until they grew old. Dreams of the thrill as they feel their dust spill through their fingertips And they laugh at the curse that follows other men's gold.Remember man you are dust and to dust you'll return. If you sell out your soul then in Hell you will burn. Think of what you've been told 'bout worshiping gold. And take care my friend You must beware... of the curse that follows other men's gold.Seven men gambled on the turn of a card gambling their gold away and losing came hard. They weren't satisfied until 6 of them died only one man lived... to tell the tale of the curse that follows other men's gold.Remember man you are dust and to dust you'll return. If you sell out your soul then in Hell you will burn. Think of what you've been told 'bout worshiping gold. And take care my friend You must beware... of the curse that follows other men's gold.Remember man you are dust and to dust you'll return. If you sell out your soul then in Hell you will burn.

	schema:headline " A Terrific Spaghetti Western with James Garner and Dennis Weaver!";
	schema:reviewBody "Many American leading men trailed Clint Eastwood to Europe during the heyday of the Spaghetti western in the 1960s and 1970s. Reportedly not only did Lee Van Cleef achieve superstar status on the continent but he also surpassed Eastwood's popularity in westerns. Burt Reynolds took top billing in Sergio Corbucci's Navajo Joe about a vengeful redskin. Henry Fonda and Charles Bronson tangled in Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time in the West. James Coburn and Eli Wallach anted up for a couple of oaters. Most American stars were either solidly established or whose careers were riding the rails to the big sundown such as Guy Madison Rod Cameron Stewart Granger John Ireland Yul Brynner etc. Surprisingly lightweight leading man James Garner crossed the Atlantic for War  Peace producer Dino De Laurentiis to star in a savage western A Man Called Sledge with former Combat star Vic Morrow at the helm. Fellow Combat alumnus Frank Kowlaski coscripted A Man Called Sledge with Morrow. This formulaic shoot'em up saga qualifies as James Garner's most unusual role. The Maverick star shunned his affable image to play against type as a noholds barred outlaw who is clearly on the wrong side of the law. Dennis Weaver of Gunsmoke Claude Akins of Return of the Seven and Colt .45 star Wade Preston fleshed out the Sledge cast along with fellow Americans Ken Clark and Tony Young. Shot on location by seasoned lenser Luigi Kuveiller against the sheer raw beauty of Spain this frontier western adventure told a tale about greed and revenge. Essentially Sledge emerged as an impossible heist western similar to director Don Taylor's The 5Man Army 1969 with Peter Graves and James Daly.A Man Called Sledge opensin Sergio Corbucci countrywith Luther Sledge James Garner and Mallory Tony Young of Taggart robbing a stagecoach on a snowy mountain trail. During the holdup the shotgun guard chucks his weapon. Incredibly a freak accidentthat neither Sledge nor Mallory anticipatedoccurs. The shotgun discharges and kills the driver. Talk about coincidence! Sledge and Mallory make off with the loot to a secluded saloon known as 'the 3 Ws. They feel awful about the accidental death of the driver. Sledge has come to meet his girlfriend Ria Laura Antonelli of Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bombs and he joins her upstairs in a room. Overconfident Mallory decides to play poker. You're the worse poker player I ever saw Sledge reminds Mallory. Ironically Mallory wins hand after hand. Triumphantly as he gathers his fortune Mallory observes I just made a killing and evil Floyd Ken Clark of Attack of the Giant Leeches shoots him in the back. Sledge stumbles down the stairs and finds Mallory dead on the floor. Floyd and his cohorts ridicule Sledge. Sledge whips out Mallory's pistol and guns them both down. An old man John Marley of Love Story witnesses the gunfight. Later Sledge intercepts him in Rockville and suspects him for being a bounty hunter. The old man goes berserk after Sledge trusses him up so he cannot watch an escort of 40armed riders take a gold payroll into a nearly prison for safekeeping. He explains that the riders lock up the goldusually about 300thousand worthin the prison vault overnight before they continue to the clear house.The old man recounts his prison days. I never could sleep when that gold was next to me. You know gold gives off a scent. It's like an animal or a man. Paper money don't throw off a scent. Paper money don't whisper to you like gold does through six inches of steel. Sledge decides to steal the gold but Ward Dennis Weaver and Hooker Claude Atkins are leery about the heist. Similarly Sledge reveals a lot about himself when he says I ain't kidding myself that it is the last. I'm gonna finish my life with a white picket fence and the little woman making biscuits. Me sprouting gray like a tree in the fall. I wanna go out with a bullet in my head or a rope around my neck. I want a little taste of living before I go. Sledge and company follow the gold from mine to prison but find no flaw in the security precautions. They ride into Rockville for supplies and the Old Man poses as a head of a westbound family and an arsenal of weapons. I feel like one of those Eastern war profiteers Sims confides in Rockville Sheriff Ripley Wade Preston that the Old Man bought enough firepower to save Custer. When Ripley enters the store Sledge pokes a gun in his back. Another gunfight erupts and a Sledge man dies in a murderous crossfire. After the death of one of their own Ward and Hooker are really reluctant about the gold shipment robbery until Sledge devises a daring plan. Since they cannot take it from the outside Sledge proposes to take it in the prison. Ward poses as Deputy Marshall and gains entrance to the prison because he has Sledge in his custody. They put Sledge in solitary with the rest of the other loonies and Sledge breaks out with Ward's help. Morrow generates considerable suspense in solitary with their breakout. The way that Sledge gets out of being taken by Ripley to the Rockville City Jail is clever too.Thematically A Man Called Sledge concerns greed and the song 'The Curse that Follows Other Men's Gold' summarizes the storyline. Everybody is after somebody else's gold and greed consumes them to the point that nothing else matters. This western boasts some irony so that the action contains greater depth. Mallory wins at cards but loses his life. Audaciously Sledge engineers a way into the worst prison in the Southwest where the authorities would dearly love to incarcerate him. Later he lashes a crucifix to his hand so he can fire his gun. A Man Called Sledge qualifies a gritty but entertaining Italian western!".

Folks like Dennis Weaver Claude Akins John Marley.

But he has played serious and done it well in films like The Children's Hour and Hour of the Gun. He can and has broken away from his usual stereotyped part successfully. But A Man Called Sledge can't be counted as one of his successes.He's got the title role as Luther Sledge notorious outlaw with a big price on his head. After partner Tony Young gets killed in a saloon and Garner takes appropriate Eastwood style measures he's followed from the saloon by John Marley.Marley's spent time in the nearby territorial prison and it seems as though gold shipments are put under lock and key there on a rest stop for the folks transporting the stuff on a regular run. Garner gets his gang together for a heist.Here's where the movie goes totally off the wall. Usually heist films show the protagonists going into a lot of methodical planning. Certainly that was the case in The War Wagon which some other reviewer cited. But in this one Garner decides to break into the prison as a prisoner of fake US Marshal Dennis Weaver and cause a jailbreak at which time the gold will be robbed. That was just too much to swallow. If taking the gold was this easy it should have been done a long time before. But I will say for those who like the blood and guts of Italian westerns during that prison break there's enough there for three movies.That's not the whole thing of course the outlaws fall out and we have another gore fest before the film ends. But by that time the whole film has lost a lot of coherency.The great movie singer of the Thirties Allan Jones is listed in the credits. But for the life of me I can't find him in the film. Maybe a chorus of the Donkey Serenade might have made this better.Couldn't have hurt any.".

They hatch a harebrained heist but things go awry due to their greedy obsessions. Dennis Weaver and Claude Akins play members of the gang while John Marley appears as an old man who joins them. Laura Antonelli is on hand as the striking babe while Wayde Preston appears as the sheriff.Aside from his TV work with shows like Maverick and Cheyenne Garner only appeared in nine Westerns with just four being serious Westerns rather than comedytinged Westerns. A Man Called Sledge was the last of those four and his character Luther Sledge is a far cry from likable gambler Bret Maverick or heroic Jess Remsberg in Duel at Diablo 1966 or the determined Wyatt Earp in Hour of the Gun 1967. Even as an outlaw though Garner still has his genial charm but when innocents start dying due to his lucrehungry schemes he pretty much loses all sympathy. And his band of owlhoots get zero sympathy from the getgo.While often referred to as a Spaghetti Western Sledge is actually a Dino De Laurentiis production with an American directorwriter Morrow and main cast but shot in Spain with Italians and other Europeans in peripheral positions cast  production for instance the Spaghettiflavored music by Gianni Ferrio.The movie comes across as a mishmash of Sergio Leone Westerns The War Wagon 1967 Mackenna's Gold 1969 The Wild Bunch 1969 and There was a Crooked Man 1970. But with a few imaginative elements such as the wintery opening which is rare for a Western and the funeral component at the Mexican village in the final act not to mention the quirky late 60sish theme song repeated throughout. Also the opening gunfight in the saloon is thrilling and I like how the film closes with a pretty moving moral. It's even haunting. Unfortunately the movie features some clumsy editing in the third act starting with the card game and the immediate aftermath.The film runs 93 minutes and was shot in Almeria Andalucia Spain and Rome interiors.

Throw in some then trendy slowmo shots and crossdissolves which call attention to themselves rather than serve a storytelling purpose. The plot is the standard big heist thing insert The War Wagon here with Sledge plotting how to heist a 300000 gold shipment. His gang includes Claude Akins and Dennis Weaver. The problem is that while on the move the shipment is guarded by 40 outriders and while stopped it is locked in a vault inside the territorial prison. I think there was an episode of Alias Smith and Jones with the same plot.The story would make a decent hour of television but gets old very fast as a very padded feature length film. Garner does not allow any of his charm to leak into his characterization and the film does not generate enough suspense to hold a viewer's interest.The thing finally crashes and burns shortly after the heist when the gang engages in a contrived and totally illogical card game.

The fact that it is an ItaloAmerican coproduction and was filmed in Almeria Andalucia Spain as many subproductions does not necessarily include it in the category of Italian culinary specialties. Or if someone wants to include it in spaghetti then it can be put alongside Sergio Leone's first two westerns. I have never seen James Garner in such a good role and I've seen him in many movies almost all of them. In fact the real reason I wanted to see the movie is Laura Antonelli. Unfortunately she appears so little having a minimal screen time. But she's prettier than ever. Dennis Weaver John Marley Claude Akins all three have cool credible roles. Ken Clark known from some Eurospy films has a minor role is shot at the very beginning. Very good music by Gianni Ferrio in the Morricone in his good days spirit. Great Luigi Kuveiller as director of photography. Good direction by Vic Morrow the actor who died young in that unfortunate accident. Those who wrote bad about the movie should take a cold shower and see the movie once again.".

Sledge concocts a bold plan to get said fortune but can he and his men successfully pull off this daring caper? Director Vic Morrow who also cowrote the tight and hardhitting script with Frank Kowalski relates the absorbing story at a steady pace delivers a vivid and credible evocation of the 18th century period setting ably creates and maintains a resolutely tough gritty nononsense tone throughout and stages the thrilling shootouts with real ripsnorting aplomb. The robbery itself is an expertly executed set piece tense gripping and extremely exciting. This film really hits its stride with an especially dark and harsh last third in which Sledge's carefully thought out plan is undone by greed and treachery. The sturdy acting from the sound cast qualifies as another major asset with standout contributions by Laura Antonelli as Sledge's loyal and worried main squeeze Ria Dennis Weaver as the laidback pragmatic Erwin Ward Claude Akins as the fierce hottempered Hooker John Marley as a wily and rascally old man and Wayde Preston as the vengeful Sheriff Ripley. Luigi Kuveiller's sharp widescreen cinematography makes striking use of artful fades and elaborate dissolves. Gianni Ferrio's twangy'n'lively score does the rousing tuneful trick. The surprise downbeat ending packs a wickedly potent punch. A very good and gutsy movie.".

Imprisoning yourself to steal the gold and then playing a winner take all poker game to leave one man standing with everything then the losers hunting him down. Sounds bloody great but it isn't at all. I quite disliked James Garner as the lead thought he was quite bland. Dennis Weaver should have been cast as Sledge he would have brought intensity to the role. Imprisoning themselves at a high security prison relying on the fact that Sledge won't be searched and be stuck locked up for ever seems too heavy a risk. They kept showing who was winning and losing in the poker and their expressions and outbursts but never actually showing the poker or discussing it. It's like the script says poker scene and it's basically a blank page such a shame. Then you have the old man who seems to all of a sudden be in charge of this group once Sledge is gone why are they trying to go up against their gun slinging leader with this stranger he didn't do them wrong at all and they know they can't beat him.".

While it might have been relevant in a war environment in a western it's highly unusual and distracting for the viewer. He also often disregard the old rule of not crossing the axis with the camera which makes for startling camera placement ! Only western I know that goes from western to meninprison film to film noir check out the nighttime prison scene where all other prisoners suddenly start howling at the moon !!  to a very nasty STRAW DOGS style revenge movie with a Mexican Death Ceremony thrown in near the end ! Soundtrack goes from efficient to unusually jazzy to down right silly the theme song being particularly atrocious ! A few years before he was to find a bloody horse head in his bed in THE GODFATHER veteran actor John Marley as the Old Man shows us he could actually ride one for real  Finally I don't care what the credits say this is definitely NOT gorgeous Italian beauty Laura Antonelli playing Ria Sledge's girlfriend ...

As we mature we are at some point confronted with the realization some sooner some later that age and experience do not necessarily equate to satisfaction and personal identity in our lives the two things we are all though perhaps subconsciously striving to attain.  But it's an elusive butterfly we're chasing and at a certain age the lack of fulfillment in one's life may be dismissed outofhand by some as a midlife crisis in a feeble attempt to justify certain actions or attitudes.  Attaching such a label to it however is merely simplifying a state of being that seems to be perpetually misunderstood and we resort to using psychological ploys on ourselves in order to rationalize away behavior that is often unacceptable in the cold light of reason and morality.  This of course is not a unique situation but an inevitable step one takes upon reaching an age at which the awareness of mortality begins to set in which is something we all have to deal with in our own way in our own time.  And it's an issue that lies allegorically at the heart of director Ang Lee's pensive insightful drama The Ice Storm' in which we discover that more often than not the adult we become is nothing more than an extension of the adolescent we may shed the skin of youth but the awkward confusion and uncertainty remains albeit manifested in different ways to which for awhile we may respond in opposition even to our own conscience creating a double standard in our lives which only serves to exacerbate the confusion and unhappiness leaving us alone to face the cold and frozen landscapes of our own soul.Working from an insightful and intelligent screenplay by James Schamus who also wrote Lee's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' and Eat Drink Man Woman' among others Lee has crafted and delivered a lyrical and poetic though somewhat dark film that tells the story of two neighboring families living in Connecticut in the early 70s  Ben and Elena Hood Kevin Kline and Joan Allen and their children Paul Tobey Maguire and Wendy Christina Ricci and Jim and Janey Carver Jamey Sheridan and Sigourney Weaver and their children Mikey Elijah Wood and Sandy Adam HannByrd.  And it's a story to which many will be able to relate on a very personal individual level as it reflects an issue common to us all that of trying to make a tangible connection with someone or something in our life that we can hold on to and take comfort in.  Ben and Elena have grown apart she has distanced herself emotionally and sexually from Ben and unfulfilled she longs again for the freedom of her spent youth while Ben seeks solace in an emotionally vapid but physically satisfying relationship with another woman.  Jim who spends much of his time on the road has become completely disconnected from his entire family his children are apathetic to his very presence and Janey exists in a constant state of promiscuous numbness yet cold and indifferent to her own husband.  The Hood and Carver children meanwhile are suffering the pains of adolescence and trying to figure out the world in which they live exploring their feelings with and for one another and attempting to understand the whys and wherefores of it all.  And to whom can they turn for guidance in an era that's giving them Nixon and Watergate new age spiritualism and selfabsorbed parents who teach one thing and do another? The story unfolds through the eyes of sixteenyearold Paul whose meditations on the literal and figurative ice storm that descends upon the two families over a long Thanksgiving weekend forms the narrative of the film.  And it's through Paul's observations that Lee so subtly and effectively presents his metaphor in which he captures the beauty as well as the ugliness that inexplicably coexists within and which surrounds the turbulence and turmoil of the Hood's and Carver's world which is ultimately visited by tragedy as their drama proceeds to it's inevitable climax.  It's sensitive material that will undoubtedly touch a nerve with many in the audience and Lee takes great care to present it accordingly with a studied finesse that makes it an emotionally involving and thoroughly engrossing drama.Lee also knows how to get the best out of his actors and there are a number of outstanding and memorable performances in this film beginning with that of Kevin Kline.  Kline does comedy well but he does drama even better as he proves here with his portrayal of Ben.  The final scene of the film in fact belongs to Kline as it is here that we discover the true nature of the man he is in his heart of hearts.  It's a superb piece of acting and one of the real strengths of the film.Joan Allen also turns in a strong performance through which she reveals the insufferable inner conflict that so affects Elena's life and especially her relationship with Ben.  And it's in Allen's character more than any of the others that we see how fine the line is between the adult and the adolescent.  It is not unusual to find a bit of the mother in the daughter but Allen shows us through Elena just how much of the daughter is actually in the mother which underscores one of the basic tenets of the film.  It's a performance that should've earned Allen an Oscar nomination at the very least.Also turning in performances that demand special attention are Maguire Ricci Wood and especially Jamey Sheridan whose portrayal of Jim is one of his best it's believable and totally honest.  Penetrating and incisive The Ice Storm' is remarkably poignant and absorbing without question it's one of Lee's finest films.  1010.".

Every performance is perfect. The direction by Ang Lee is deliberate and painful as he slices into you with the lives of those he makes you watch. It looks amazing in a beautifully bleak way. It is also one the most compelling and painful movies that I have ever come across. The family life portrayed is messed up and all the relationships that are displayed are disfunctional on some level or other. But still I was forced to care for them  all of them. Such is the brilliance of the acting and the script writing.I own this film but I can't watch it alot. Once a year is just enough. It's to traumatic and beautiful to watch more than that.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am deeply touched. I can not believe it took me 7 years to get to see this movie. It goes straight into my top ten.The movie is based on Rick Moody's 1994 novel about the life of two suburban families in New Canaan Connecticut during the time of the Watergate scandal A time of sexual liberation and of disintegration of existing social norms and of the nuclear family. The characters may stand as symbols of the kind of people that are created out of a society with decreasing social norms. They are ordinary people who live in material welfare bored unhappy confused scared of conflicts and constantly seeking something else than they already have.Instead of being examples to their children the parents are constantly trying to run away from their own emotional confusion for instance by seeking casual sex and thereby hurting each other. In the meantime the children are left to their own upbringing watching bad TV shows emptying their parents' drinks blowing up toys on the balcony shoplifting experimenting with sex and drugs. The communication between parents and children is terrible or should I say nonexisting. They all live in their separate worlds all the time more disconnected until a tragedy caused by a natural disaster finally calls them back to life and hopefully makes them look beyond themselves and see how valuable and fragile life is. May this provoke back the belief in what the family as a unit can do for each other if they stand together?The movie is both uncomfortable and at the same time enormously satisfying to watch  perhaps because the theme is presented in such a human and recognizable manner. The dialogue is great and there are even very funny scenes at times. These people seem so real and so fragile like you and me. It is as if we can see right through their souls and their pain.The cast is brilliant except for that irritating Katie Holmes with her cheap Hollywood teenage series look. I have never seen a movie plenty of child actors acted out as professionally and convincing as this one. Christina Ricci is the best and Elijah Wood is also excellent much more enjoyable than in LOTR making me wish they were young again so they could have more roles in movies like this.The atmosphere caused by the weather gives a kind of somber mood stressed by the dimmed colors and the mystical music score.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Ice Storm' is an incredibly bleak and dark film set in the 70s about two connected families during the holiday break of Thanksgiving. The first family consists of Ben Kevin Kline and Elena Joan Allen and their two kids  16yearold Paul Tobey Maguire just home from boarding school and 14yearold Wendy Christina Ricci a wannabe antiwarantiNixon elitist who is coming to terms with her own sexuality. The second family consists of Janey Sigourney Weaver whom Ben is having an affair with her husband Jim Jamey Sheridan and their two boys  the neurotic introvert Mikey Elijah Wood and his younger shy pyromaniac brother Sandy AdamN Hann Byrd. The film takes place during Thanksgiving day and the day after in the lives of these people  including Ben and Elena's marriage being put to the test at a swinger's party with Janey and Jim Paul's love conquest in New York City with a girl from boarding school named Libbets Katie Holmes and Wendy's sexual misadventures with Mikey and Sandy both.'The Ice Storm' is an incredibly powerful and relevant ensemble piece about the complexity of family and relationships both sexual and nonsexual. Ang Lee once again proves he is a director of great skill and exquisite understanding of human emotions and James Schamus provides a harrowing and painfully realistic screenplay. Kevin Kline delivers yet another nearflawless dramatic performance while Sigourney Weaver is great in her interesting yet limited role. The children of the ensemble cast Maguire Byrd Wood Ricci Holmes Krumholtz are all excellent especially Christina Ricci who owns her role. However the real scenestealer in my eyes is the marvelous Joan Allen who plays her role with such intensity and elegance that I'm shocked she didn't receive a Best Actress Oscar Nomination.In conclusion 'The Ice Storm' is a powerful little movie that's interesting yet not exciting. It isn't groundbreaking by any standards but it's incredibly wellmade. 'The Ice Storm' was totally ignored at the '98 Oscar Ceremony but that comes to no enormous surprise. It was competing in the same year 'L.A. Confidential' 'Boogie Nights' 'Amistad' 'The Sweet Hereafter' 'As Good as It Gets' and the dreadfully overrated 'Titanic' were. A small little character study like 'The Ice Storm' didn't stand a chance. If you can appreciate a movie like this I highly recommend this oldie I just got around to seeing. Grade A".

Books such as The Sensuous Woman The Hite Report and Open Marriage were best sellers then wife swapping parties were in vogue and sex in general was touted as the road to happiness. I wouldn't go so far as to say that casual sex destroyed families although in some cases it did but I think there were many unhappy families broken up by divorce and infidelity who in earlier decades would have remained together in secret misery quiet desperation behind the smiling traditional family facade. The early and mid 70s were a miserable time in America for many reasons the energy crisis economic recession horrible winter weather in the northeast anyway and loss of faith in the government in the wake of the Vietnam war Watergate and the Nixon administration. The basement sex play scene between Ricci and Wood is the ultimate metaphor for that time sexual experimentation between young teenagers is a normal part of life something most kids do and they might even have had fun but Ricci throws a bizarre twist into it when she puts on the Nixon mask. Note Wood's confused and almost frightened expression as he approaches her. The act itself becomes purely mechanical lacking any warmth or joy because of the physical barrier preventing eye contact. The mask is the perfect symbol of people hiding behind facades of society's distrust of the oppressive and duplicitous Presidency you might even say Nixon screwed us and of the lack of warmth and human intimacy that went along with casual sex at a time when people were trying to find any means possible to feel better or even just feel good. The ice storm itself symbolizes not only the unhappy cold and dangerously slippery lives these people were frozen inside but also in a larger sense it is a metaphor of a very unsure and uncomfortable era.".

	schema:reviewBody "The summary statement I write I mean as a compliment. In short this film will keep you up thinking about the characters the whole swarm of tragedy sewn into these characters as it is a true look at American familial dysfunction. It's also the Chinesedirected cousin of American Beauty in some ways just as compelling if maybe a little more heavy on the metaphors and by the end of it however down and drained the film made me feel I knew I'd seen my favorite Ang Lee film thus far. He takes the subject matter the script by James Schamus and the nuanced performances and makes it so that we feel for these people however trapped into their uppermiddle class walks of life. The ice theme does work for a good lot of the film and even when it gets hammered down to the line I was still moved by how these families intertwined the bleakness but also the little bits of light coming through.In fact the film shares a good deal with American Beauty two families both fairly screwed up with infidelity drugs procrastination young lust and a certain pining for the old days going steadily down the tubes. One family are the Hooods Kevin Kline Joan Allen Christina Ricci and Tobey MaGuire the other are the Carvers Sigourney Weaver Elijah Wood Henry Czerny and Adam HannByrd. Either side has their share of dilemmas psychological cramps and just total aimlessness. The performances from all are unique and quiet desperate and at least a few in tune with the 'ice' theme in particular Weaver Wood and Allen are numbed. Basically there isn't as much story as there is attention to the fates and parallels of the characters.Among the lot though Kline has some of his best work to date with his controlling demeanor masking something very insecure HannByrd and Wood are totally complimentary so to speak in that they work well at being brothers of the same weird seed Allen not much more to say that hasn't been said by others and even smaller roles filled by Katie Holmes and David Krumholtz are worth the time. There stories all lead up to the big chunk of the story ala the 'day you die' stuff in American Beauty and at times it's painful cringeinducing darkly amusing and at the end hitting notes that had me eyes go wide. And the ending when it comes is sentimental but never unrealistic. This is the kind of tone that Lee would also use for Brokeback Mountain but here it contains even more depth and intrigue into the dysfunction ironically in only the span of a few days vs. the span of twenty years in Brokeback.You may whether you like the film or not will want to talk about it once it is over. It of course can be argued and I would argue it that the 'ice' motif is pushed to as far as it can go and then some then again it IS called the Ice Storm. But in contrast another minor theme is handled superbly involving the Fantastic Four comic book that Maguire's character gives some narration about. By looking through an abstract of a comic book there's some extra meaning that can be put into the film the power that can be taken away from superheroes as well as the enclosed New Canaan citizens. Along with some great 70's era period use the NixonWatergate stuff adding another layer to the frustration leading up to a truly disturbing moment involving a Nixon mask including music creates a very impressive atmosphere. Maybe I'll check out the film again when it's not past midnight though even after hours the film packs a small wallop. 9.510".

	schema:reviewBody "THE ICE STORM  1997 Starring Kevin Kline Joan Allen Sigourney Weaver Tobey Maguire Christina Ricci Elijah Wood and Katie Holmes Director Ang Lee   113 minutes  Rated R for strong sexual content and for drug use  languageBy Blake French Ang Lee's The Ice Storm is such a provocative and unsettling experience that it made Gene Siskel's top movie of 1997. Since then Siskel has recently passed away. But Being an avid film reviewer and buff I thought that it would be appropriate for me to screen The Ice Storm for a second time this time in full awareness of Siskel's thoughts on the film. After careful inspection I think that I agree with my favorite movie critic's opinion and feel obligated to post a review explaining why.Watching The Ice Storm is a unique occurrence. Movie's don't get this powerful every time one visits a local multiplex.  The story is basically a series of sins and involvement's that dig the characters deeper and deeper into an emotional crater. The time period is about thirty to forty years ago. Kevin Kline and Joan Allen are Ben and Elena Hood. They have a son whose 16 Paul and a sexually confused 14 year old daughter named Wendy. This is not a happy family and the film never pretends otherwise. Ben is having an adulterous affair with his neighbor's wife Janey Carver. Her husband Jim is pretty much unsuspecting but Ben's wife is dubious of her mysteriously acting spouse. The Carvers also have teenage children named Mikey and Sandy. Mickey is ready to explore a sexual underworld with Wendy and she is prepared to experiment with whoever comes down her path first.Elena is caught stealing from a local party store one day and that triggers an effect that causes her to react openly to her husband about his involvement's with Janey Carver. When Ben and Elena visit a wife swapping party where the guests put their keys in a dish to see who an individual will sleep with things become even more adulterous with the Carvers.The film is propelled by unique one of a kind performances by all the actors in the cast. Sigourney Weaver receiving a best supporting actress nomination for her performance is superb in a slutty whorish kind of a way. Joan Allen is also perfection delivering a sense of egresses and desire without ever speaking that much. Tobey Maguire Christina Ricci Elijah Wood and Adam HannByrd all act well as the teens. Basically all the one screen appeal of The Ice Storm is top class. But there is something more than just the on screen appeal with this movie. Something that allows the audience to experience a feeling of confusion along with the characters. We can become so involved in the story because all the story consists of is a pile of heavy sins. We feel the character's needs. Relate to the issues. Things happen that struck me so profoundly that I find myself listing the film on my list of top 100 movies of all time. In the last scene of  The Ice Storm a key character brakes down and cries like a baby with his family next to his side. We look back at all the wrongdoing he has done at all the sins he has committed and all the reasons he has to cry and we fell his painand somewhere deep down we try to forgive him.".

THE ICE STORM is a much more literal evocation of that theme. It follows a pair of Boomer couples living with their children in the '70s that infamous shadow of their own social awakening.In the aftermath of the sexual revolution we find the occupants of the film bored out of their minds with one another and life itself recalling an assertion by MAD magazine about revolutions taking all the fun out of sex. Kevin Kline in particular appears to be turning into something we infer he must have hated at one time. Joan Allen playing his wife and brilliant as usual is clawing at the universe trying desperately for some kind of escape. Sigourney Weaver his mistress is THE GRADUATE's Mrs. Robinson and therefore its Benjamin Braddock by extension  bored wise and lost all at the same time. Their kids are being neglected and haunted by the distance that has developed between them and their families they are forced into a kind of growth for which their parents never bothered to prepare them and worse yet they know it.The couples' idea of liberation has led to their decadence but it's important to note that THE ICE STORM is not a preachy moralistic movie. Its insistence is not that sexual awareness and honesty are bad but simply that the real life that inevitably comes knocking cannot be ignored. The world is ripped away because no one has been paying attention and superficial ideas of need have replaced genuine purpose. At the end Kevin Kline cries tears not necessarily of desperation or loss  though these ingredients undoubtedly contribute  but of joy because he has realized and it isn't too late.Brilliant performances all around from a nowallstar cast. Of special note is Christina Ricci this may be her best work as she projects not just her usual cool candor but also a naivet that warms the blood of her character. Tobey Maguire is also outstanding.While this has become one of my favorites of the last ten years it is a difficult movie in some ways and it may take a while to appreciate but don't miss it and try and tell me you don't feel the cold air at the finale.".

Of special note is Christina Ricci this may be her best work as she projects not just her usual cool candor but also a naivet that warms the blood of her character. Tobey Maguire is also outstanding.While this has become one of my favorites of the last ten years it is a difficult movie in some ways and it may take a while to appreciate but don't miss it and try and tell me you don't feel the cold air at the finale.";

I spent 90 minutes enduring an endless series of pointless dysfunctional encounters that made me squirm in my chair with terminal embarrassment.  The characters were dismal emotional wrecks with no moral inclination whatsoever.

So what ?  I never formed any emotional ties to any of these people anyway.How could you take so many talented actors and create a story no one should ever see?  The writers obviously had talent how else could they create situations that actually had me hiding my face waiting for the agony to subside.  They had talented actors like Joan Allen and Kevin Kline and yet wasted their time and ours. I found it hard to believe that this came from the same directorwriter team that produced the charming Eat Drink Man Women.On the plus side the acting was good the circa 1970's homes and wardrobes were the best 70's piece ever and the cinematography outstanding.  If you are the kind of person that stops to enjoy the carnage of a good train wreck then this movie might just be for you.".

Seeming unable to find their welfare the adult members start acting strange almost searching for a new life while their kids who are in need of guidance are completely ignored leaving them free to do whatever they desire no matter how wrong it might be. It's a very odd movie which tries to present something special but ends up telling boring and ordinary adventures of ordinary people which tend to exit their ordinary life in search of something else. To be honest I really don't understand its high rating. It presents absolutely nothing impressive just a series of apparently random events which make more or less sense by people who seem to have mostly lost their mind. Almost every action they undertake is either simple and boring or stupid and without any logic. Not to mention the kids here who seem a bunch of misfits gathered together just to have something for the movie. It really is boring as hell you don't get to see anything interesting anything that may catch or attention or which might at some point bring even a tiny bit of suspense. I really am puzzled by the fact that somebody can consider this one a very good film. The characters a boring the action is boring and even the finale doesn't bring anything to the film. It just ends as abruptly as it starts. Almost pointlessThe way I see it it's a movie which has a series of boring and ordinary events and considers that if you bring something more or less controversial into the story like an affair some random stealing or some random sexual desires you can make something great in the end. It doesn't bring anything interesting it just creates drama from something dull and ordinary and expects the viewer to be amazed by its events.".

Two years later ChineseAmerican director Ang Lee adapted the novel into a film 'The Ice Storm'. However the film remained quite marginal and hardly noticed it was a major box office flop yet critics seemed to love the film I'm in the with critics once again. It is nice to see now that with Ang Lee's Oscar winning hit what many even consider a masterpiece Brokeback Mountain everyone wants to check out his other films this being no exception what so ever.Many of the people in Ang Lee's films are on the verge of somekind of breakdown or are learning more about themselves and their sexuality as is a case in this film. Almost everyone gets caught doing something associated with a taboo or something they shouldn't be doing in this film. Set just before and on Thanksgiving that most depressing and overwrought of Hallmarkdriven holidays perhaps especially in New England where the whole hypocritical business originated the film is cold. It's filled with images of visible breath puffs frozen ground and ice delicately dark gray or crystal clear  mementos of existential paybacks and endless cycles of pain. The moral design is a familiar one in movies and novels in which carelessness malice and guilt always come with extravagant emotional price tags.The ice is almost everywhere. At times it has a metaphorical meaning which is overstatedthese characters are frozen in harsh fragile existences and don't you forget it they are stuck. But it's also greatlooking and adds beauty to the film and the mess the characters are in it clicks in the wind on tree branches and those chimes favored by people with porches breaks open in those metal ice trays makes driving treacherous cracks when people walk over it and glitters in sunlight. Elena and Ben like most everyone else in the film might be understood to be living under ice inside it too close to its transparent surface. The two families are the highly dysfunctional and anti social Hoods and the Carvers neighbors who need compete with and resent each other. They're all afraid to be found out as unhappy or underresourcedto be forced to imagine alternatives. Their affluence is devastating.Elena Hood is finding it hard to confront her husband Ben Hood on his affair with Janey Carver a cold and distant woman who doesn't like her real husband. The kids especially the promiscuous Wendy Hood are all discovering more about their sex lives and soon experimenting with it however a majority of it is shown because that's just the way it should be it's style over substance remember that one. Wendy Hood connects almost all of the kids together as she has relationships with almost all of them.Everyone in The Ice Storm is either uptight on the verge of breakdown shrill and too aware of their various audiences. The film captures this sense of vergeness perfectly. For all its aesthetic and thematic chilliness it's about melting and depressing too. And that's how you're left by the surprisingly dramatic but admirably underplayed finale feeling just a bit melted. The performances are amazing and it was Christina Ricci's first mature role and I must say she handled it fantastically. Among the rest of the talented cast is Kevin Kline Joan Allen Sigourney Weaver Toby McGuire and Elijah Wood. The direction is also fantastic which easily makes Ang Lee one of the most talented active directors today.Overall the Ice Storm is disturbingly bleak and depressing however all of that is totally relevant with its plot and all. It is an almost flawless film making its way into the list of one of my favourite films an unforgettable experience is what this film gave me.1010 See It If You Liked American Beauty Blue Velvet and Brokeback Mountain Luke Rowe".

The kids especially the promiscuous Wendy Hood are all discovering more about their sex lives and soon experimenting with it however a majority of it is shown because that's just the way it should be it's style over substance remember that one. Wendy Hood connects almost all of the kids together as she has relationships with almost all of them.Everyone in The Ice Storm is either uptight on the verge of breakdown shrill and too aware of their various audiences. The film captures this sense of vergeness perfectly. For all its aesthetic and thematic chilliness it's about melting and depressing too. And that's how you're left by the surprisingly dramatic but admirably underplayed finale feeling just a bit melted. The performances are amazing and it was Christina Ricci's first mature role and I must say she handled it fantastically. Among the rest of the talented cast is Kevin Kline Joan Allen Sigourney Weaver Toby McGuire and Elijah Wood. The direction is also fantastic which easily makes Ang Lee one of the most talented active directors today.Overall the Ice Storm is disturbingly bleak and depressing however all of that is totally relevant with its plot and all. It is an almost flawless film making its way into the list of one of my favourite films an unforgettable experience is what this film gave me.1010 See It If You Liked American Beauty Blue Velvet and Brokeback Mountain Luke Rowe";

	schema:headline " The way we REALLY were";
	schema:reviewBody "I was Paul Hood's age during Thanksgiving of 1973. If you were a teenager during 1973 you must see this movie. Ang Lee brings that era back in spades. The wardrobe is just amazing. 1973 was a really weird year anyway people were depressed the sixties were over nobody knew what would be next.. It was a really strange time. There was the first gas shortage in US history and the price doubled. When you could find it. Terrific soundtrack and a thought provoking look back at the US of that time. An all star cast I won't repeat a lot of what's already been said but the movie is like a virtual time machine.I think we were a better society then a more tolerant one. Even Nixon seems benign compared to our current government.The serendipity of Tobey Maguire reading Marvel Comics is surreal now with that whole Spiderman career of sorts which followed. The Party he thought he was going to be alone with Katie Holmes was evocative as well.. If you weren't partying you weren't connecting. Human connection and family is the core of this movie. The recurring attempts at a real human connection was thematic. Joan Allen's quirky shoplifting and bicycle riding her encounters with the long haired Reverend Philip Edwards was insightful. This is a movie with layer upon layer of pathos.I do think a special mention is reserved for Allison Janney. Great as the hostess Dot Halford The Halfords annual party this time with the twist of being a key party. Her role though small was memorable. Especially the Zebra dress. Very 1973. The uppermiddle class average woodsy exurban living kind of mirrored my own. It's almost spooky exactly how spot on everything was. I think Kevin Kline Sigourney Weaver Joan Allen and Jamey Sheridan were horribly overlooked during the Academy awards decision making process.The most hilarious scene in an otherwise dark movie was Wendy's Cristine Ricci who the camera just loves by the way trombone recital at home. It consisted of playing two notes badly over and over. There were a couple of others like when Sigourney Weaver's character Janey Carver parked her station wagon heard a loud pop and looked at her tire as if it had blown out. Turns out her number two son Sandy deftly handled by Adam HannByrd was playing with fireworks and generally creating mayhem.. The offer of the whip to play with was priceless. The keys she later fishes out of the bowl were attached to a rather long leather woven tether it works well the way she handles those keys in a way similar to the way she handled the whip. Then when she goes inside to inquire of Mikey One of Elijah Wood's best performances to date if HE were aware of the fireworks outside. Mikey sitting with Wendy while they both watched television was oblivious. Sigourney Weaver hearing THAT just shakes her head and rolls her eyes in a combination of disbelief and exhasperation and goes back upstairs. Sigourney Weaver was excellent and Oscar worthy in my opinion for her credibility in this movie. I knew this character type from then.Ang Lee's use of ice as a recurring theme was well established early and often.. Ice Trays the old fashioned kind you had to actually crack open really set the tone for that. Even the turkey that Kevin Kline and Joan Allen wrestle with is frozen. The fact that the final 18 minutes or so of the movie is without dialogue isn't really noticed at least not by me. Very moving anyway that whole dnouement.I think I was one of the 4000 people that actually saw this movie in theatrical release. It's a movie best watched alone or with one other person. It was an early matine and I had the entire theater nearly to myself. That was great too. I've since then owned in sequence the VHS version the original DVD and I now own the CRITERION DVD and I watch it every Thanksgiving now. The richness of this film is astonishing. The Criterion treatment is well done indeed.".

I don't know anyone like any of these charactersthey're so incredibly witless and boring and enervatedno one says or does anything clever charming optimistic or plausible. Joan Allen apparently thinks that soulless nonexpression is great acting. God in Heaven a person on Quaaludes reciting the Gettysburg Address could not have given a more sluggish performance. And what's with her character's stealing of lipsticks from the pharmacy? Utter nonsense! And Christina Ricci is the creepiest creepshow in movies. Every time I see her I want to take a hot shower and go to confession. This movie reeks of pseudocynical antiAmericanism a la J. D. Salinger and his vomitinducing angst and neurotic bellybuttongazing. Oh and the voiceover tragiprofundities had me rolling my eyes and making gagreflexes. This is supposed to be really heavy man. Well it was nothing more than a college sophomore stoned on pot bought with Daddy's money. Ask yourself Do any of these people have extended families such as grandparents aunts uncles? No they live in a Connecticut vacuum as remote from real people as the planet Pluto. Even the way the writer has them respond to the weather for God's sake! is devoid of correct human observation. Having lived through some major ice storms in my life I can tell you that no one goes walking let alone driving in such weather. If you can't get right so simple a thing as how people react to weather then there is no hope whatsoever that anything else is right. This and everything else in this movie rings false false false. And don't tell me the performances were good because they were nuanced. The actors were sleepwalking throughout allowing vacancy to masquerade as heartfelt acting. Find a smile hereI dare you. No the closest you will come to is a smirkeveryone is just too cynical don't you know. Life is just so empty. Love doesn't really exist. No one has pets or hobbies or a past or emotions or passion. This is just the droppings of a writer whose only writing ability consists of spelling words correctly.Now on the plus side the photography of the ice storm is first rate. But that's akin to saying Other than that Mrs. Lincoln how was the play? There just isn't any point to this drivel. The nineties mercifully are over and so are movies like Ice Storm and American Beauty. They are embarrassing reminders of the moral bankruptcy of that period's art.".
