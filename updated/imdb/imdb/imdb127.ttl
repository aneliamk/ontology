	schema:reviewBody "The juggers are coming! is a shout that strikes both fear and excitement into the hearts of the villagers. These wretched people living in the Mad Maxesque world of postnuclear devastation will now have to defend the honor of their village by playing against a wandering band of Juggers. This game is the centerpoint of the movie. It's a brutal match of American football and medieval warfare. Both teams will try to get a dog skull on a stake at the opposite ends of a small playing field. Only problem is that only a small lightly padded player the Qwik can touch the skull and all other players are armed with clubs chains mallets and bad attitudes. Needless to say the game can get brutal broken bones and gouged eyes are common enough. But once the game is over the real insights into the world this movie creates are made. There is no brutal rivalry outside the playing field only a camaraderie that can stem from knowing what you both have been through. The winners are treated to a feast no matter how poor the village for the player's blood has brough some exitement into their otherwise dreary and hopeless lives. I will not spoil the plot here but needless to say the young elements of the wandering band of Juggers which is led by Sallow Rutger Hauer will not long be content to fight in backwater villages for little money and poor entertainment a village of starving peasants can only provide so much. On the technical side this is not a brilliant movie clearly made on a low budget most of which was probably spent on actors. But movie itself is a great masterpiece showing more and more of the world in which the Juggers live with every time you watch it. Small things will speak volumes and prove true the old saying A picture speaks more than a thousand words. Also the action scenes while they do not contain the speedy cars and flashy wrecks of Mad Max are still full of adrenalin and will leave thinking about why the game of Jugging is not played already.".

No discussion of the past as to why the world they do jugging is the way it is and everyone in this world just get on with their lives in this gritty desolate world without any lamenting thoughts to the past.I won't go into much detail but all I'll say is just watch the movie and you'll be glad that you did. By the way it seems like there are two versions which I didn't realise until I read the comments here and seems like the shorter version cuts out the ending.

	schema:headline " An unforgettable experience!";
	schema:reviewBody "One of my most interesting experiences. Alas the offcamera drama proved far more fascinating than the rather superficial futuristic actionadventure grindhouse offering that finally emerged on the screen. I worked on the film for only four days of a tenweek shooting schedule. But aside from a brief shot of me in the Red City street as I pass by Gandhi on the right of the widewide screen my part was left on the cuttingroom floor. An earlier scene in the street in which I was accosted by a young boy excitedly telling me that he'd just found a magic stone was eliminated. Indeed not only was this scene and another in which I figured as worshiper in a weirdly colorful religious ceremony at a Red City temple completely deleted but the whole subplot involving this young lad was removed. He's no longer in Salute of the Jugger at all. That's a shame because he was easily the best actor in the movie. A fine acrobat a naturally gifted charismatic performer handsome as they come with a captivating personality he looked set for major stardom. I don't even remember his name.I was on the set at the same time as Rutger Hauer Delroy Lindo Gandhi McIntyre Joan Chen Hugh KeaysByrne a wonderful actor in a madetoorder villainous role which was cut to ribbons in the editing room and numerous extras in an elaborate opening ceremony to the Red City games. This ceremony was also hacked out of the final cut. And almost as bad as the deletions already mentioned was the pruning of Joan Chen's part in the climactic game. She bravely performed her own stunts receiving many spontaneous rounds of applause from the assembled crowd artists but all her efforts came to nought. They were scissored too. On the other hand just about all Glenn Ruehland's footage was left in. He doubled for Hauer. It's interesting that the star wasn't even on the set for most of Ruehland's vigorous fighting. He came in right at the end for close ups.I didn't see much of David Peoples on the set. The first morning he had a setto with Rutger Hauer. Peoples wanted to end the star's first sequence in a Red City street with Rutger turning his back on the camera walking away down the bustling thoroughfare and being swallowed up by the unknowing crowd. But Rutger absolutely refused to turn his back on the camera. After nearly an hour of fruitless argument the producer was sent for. We waited another hour and when the money man eventually arrived he adjudicated in favor of Hauer. Peoples walked off the set. The scene was then directed the Hauer way by Keith Heygate. And in the afternoon when Peoples had not returned the jettisoned temple scene in which Hauer didn't appear anyway was directed by David Eggby. Peoples unshaven blearyeyed returned a few days later. He explained that he'd been working on the script. In the meantime the climactic games sequence had been directed and painstakingly choreographed by Guy Norris. His principal players were Ruehland who assisted in coordinating these scenes and Joan Chen. While the action specialists were busy rehearsing the juggers photographer David Eggby in close collaboration with the continuity girl indeed she took charge as the filming progressed directed two scenes with the spectators.Another interesting point was that a second camera was used for all scenes except those actually involving the games. Eggby had no connection with the second camera which had its own crew and was generally set up behind and to the side of the first. Eggby did supervise the lighting of the set and actually operated his camera himself with the aid of a focus puller. Cross was in charge of the second camera which had its own operator and focus puller. These people were completely ignored by both Eggby and Peoples who both acted as if that crew didn't exist. Cross received his instructions from Keith Heygate who yelled at Cross angrily when Cross asked for timeout to make some camera adjustments. In addition to these duties the usually pleasantmannered Heygate also personally directed the placing and blocking of the extras as well as supervising the special effects men and the animal handler. The main scene that Peoples directed himself while I was on the set was the opening ceremony of the games very elaborately staged rehearsed and choreographed. I also overheard him telling a visitor that the young lad I mentioned earlier was a great discovery and that Salute of the Jugger would set the boy firmly on the path to international acclaim.So there you have it. The credits even the seemingly endless rollcalls attached to modern films don't tell the whole story. Anything like the whole story. Many people still make important contributions without any credit at all. And some people who are credited actually do either very little to earn that name in lights or contribute far more than the field in which their name appears!Which brings me to my final point. Salute to the Jugger is a Poverty Row film in reverse. The aim of a Poverty producer is to use every trick in the book to expand his meager budget so that it looks shatteringly lavish on the screen. Jugger's editor evidently had the opposite aim. Make the film look cheap. Although filmed on a money noobject scale the onscreen Jugger has the appearance of an inferior AmericanInternational. You should have seen the Red City street down which I and about two hundred meticulously costumed extras wandered. The shops. Wow! All filmed with the weirdest most bizarre most inventively created produce and goods that highly imaginative designers and set dressers could imagine. And what do we actually see on the screen. Zilch!".

	onyx:emotionText "One of my most interesting experiences. Alas the offcamera drama proved far more fascinating than the rather superficial futuristic actionadventure grindhouse offering that finally emerged on the screen. I worked on the film for only four days of a tenweek shooting schedule. But aside from a brief shot of me in the Red City street as I pass by Gandhi on the right of the widewide screen my part was left on the cuttingroom floor. An earlier scene in the street in which I was accosted by a young boy excitedly telling me that he'd just found a magic stone was eliminated. Indeed not only was this scene and another in which I figured as worshiper in a weirdly colorful religious ceremony at a Red City temple completely deleted but the whole subplot involving this young lad was removed. He's no longer in Salute of the Jugger at all. That's a shame because he was easily the best actor in the movie. A fine acrobat a naturally gifted charismatic performer handsome as they come with a captivating personality he looked set for major stardom. I don't even remember his name.I was on the set at the same time as Rutger Hauer Delroy Lindo Gandhi McIntyre Joan Chen Hugh KeaysByrne a wonderful actor in a madetoorder villainous role which was cut to ribbons in the editing room and numerous extras in an elaborate opening ceremony to the Red City games. This ceremony was also hacked out of the final cut. And almost as bad as the deletions already mentioned was the pruning of Joan Chen's part in the climactic game. She bravely performed her own stunts receiving many spontaneous rounds of applause from the assembled crowd artists but all her efforts came to nought. They were scissored too. On the other hand just about all Glenn Ruehland's footage was left in. He doubled for Hauer. It's interesting that the star wasn't even on the set for most of Ruehland's vigorous fighting. He came in right at the end for close ups.I didn't see much of David Peoples on the set. The first morning he had a setto with Rutger Hauer. Peoples wanted to end the star's first sequence in a Red City street with Rutger turning his back on the camera walking away down the bustling thoroughfare and being swallowed up by the unknowing crowd. But Rutger absolutely refused to turn his back on the camera. After nearly an hour of fruitless argument the producer was sent for. We waited another hour and when the money man eventually arrived he adjudicated in favor of Hauer. Peoples walked off the set. The scene was then directed the Hauer way by Keith Heygate. And in the afternoon when Peoples had not returned the jettisoned temple scene in which Hauer didn't appear anyway was directed by David Eggby. Peoples unshaven blearyeyed returned a few days later.

Salute is an unapologetically brutal story perfectly cast well played and very competently filmed.  All the cast acquit themselves well Hauer is suitably grizzled and Chen manages believably to be cute scary vulnerable and savage all at once.There's very little plot or dialogue in Salute but this isn't necessarily a bad thing.  The showcase here is the heart pounding Jugger matches which are genuinely gripping and gritty action sequences shown to a sparse percussive soundtrack that only very occasionally veers slightly too close to smug Americana triumphalism.Top marks go to the stunt makeup and continuity people.  There are no Jackie Channish balletic combats here  faces smash open under brutal blows and the face remains smashed in the following scenes.  The wounds heal slowly over time but the grimly realistic scars of the Juggers remain consistent throughout.  Continuity is often underemphasised as you only miss it when it isn't there but there are no slip ups in Jugger despite its low budget.One interesting point is the change of emphasis in the 90 minute cut.  The title changes to Blood of Heroes and the message of Salute that there are no heroes only winners who sleep in silk sheets is diluted by ending prematurely on a victory high.  In the full Salute there's a frank message that for some beyond happily after after lies more sand and scars and blood.

	schema:reviewBody "I recently rewatched this movie for the first time in ages and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it held up remarkably well to my older eyes.  So many gritty postapocalyptic hero type flicks that I liked when I was younger turn out upon a more sober adult viewing to be amateurish and juvenile.  But this movie has real depth and drew me back in from the opening scene.  It fully deserves any cult status it may have achieved and I went ahead and ordered the DVD which is finally out for my collection.The film is set against the backdrop of a fully realized postapocalyptic society that actually makes sense and the game the movie is built around is well conceived and executed too.  Unlike in many futuristic movies there is no need for grand exposition explaining why everybody in the film is acting so bizarrely  in this movie you understand the people their desperation and the certain grim courage of those who dare to dream of more.  The movie also has the courage to take itself seriously while still retaining a light enough touch to throw in spots of humor throughout.The cast here is several cuts above normal for this sort of thing with a number of recognizable faces Chen D'Onofrio Hauer Lindo making believable and sympathetic characters out of what easily could have been cartoonish cutouts in a lesser film.  Chen and Hauer play the two main characters.  For Chen I think it can be argued this is her finest performance deftly combining vulnerability with courage innocence with savagery.  And for Hauer an actor who has in more recent times has become a parody of himself I think this may have represented his last truly effective performance.  The stories of these two characters are not stories of grandiose savetheworld heroes but more down to Earth stories of courage redemption and most importantly hope in a world with little of it. The characters aren't pure they're not pompous they're just normal people trying to make the best of a tough life.  And I think that makes rooting for them all the easier.  Its not so important they win  its important that the find the strength to strive rather than give up.  Simple tenacity and the courage to never give up is far more inspiring than the vast majority of the superheroes in the modern comic book adaptation fad. It really is remarkable to find such deft handling of themes like these in an offbeat movie from a genre filled with Grade B quickies.P.S. I have never seen the longer version and actually don't really have an interest to.  The shorter Blood of Heroes is appealing precisely because it manages to scrounge out hope and weary courage from the grim backdrop in a believable fashion.".

	schema:headline " Great Sports and Action movie based in a bleak and dark post apocalyptic scenario";
	schema:reviewBody "Blood of Heroes aka Salute to the Jugger. Why do i like it? The director did not make the mistake of jumping back and forth in giving a pseudo believable explanation why things are like they are.You just get thrown right there in the middle of a wasteland a la mad max leaving most of it pretty ambiguous there is a short written narration in the opening credits but it's not very insightful nor should it be. The world is shown as a giant desert small settlements here and there and overall it gives you a glimpse on how early civilizations might formed the people dressed in robes. Bedouins and nomads trying to survive in this pretty meager environment.It is demonstrative and beautifully portrayed the costumes are simplistic but great in design and efficiently put on display Especially the Jugger attires are outstanding.Well what is the premise of the movie? It is the Juggers who travel to from each settlement to play the game. so what is this game? A wild mix of gladiatorial fighting wrestling and classical ball games. Each player comes with their own attire self made helmets protection gear etc. Some teams feature a common theme such as having blue stripes on their gear fur helmets...weird among other things.Sounds bizarre but it is well thought off convincing and seems like a very interesting sport. You can pretty much guess the rules by just watching it and despite all it's brutality it really does look like fun.So the story begins like this The main protagonist SallowHauer is the leader of a clique of Juggers that travel to different settlements to play the game in oder to get recognized by the league and enter the challenge. In order to that they must collect jugs which are dog skulls and serve as play ball for the game. you win a game you keep the skulls as trophies. In the movie it is never explained fully how many games a Jugger team must win to get a challenge.Sallow himself has long a history and was once an acclaimed league player but because of some unfortunate events he had to leave the league which is hosted by the decadent authorities located in each of the nine kingdoms.the nine Kingdoms are Municap enclaves that are kept in underground vaults which are hundreds of stories deep embedded in the ground the last remains of the 20 th century.As the movie depict it it is comparable to ancient Rome or Babylon instead of beauty though we see a lot of scrap metal and factories remains of high technology from the better days. the people were fine garments of silk an is explained to be some sort of safe heaven and the closest thing to a normal functioning society.The settlements on the surface in comparison are consisting of no more then mere tents and fireplaces water is scarce etc.While Sallows team is playing in one of the towns a local young woman named KiddaJoan Chen is eagerly observing tired of field work she joins the debacle as a substitute after one of the local team members gets beaten to pulp during the game.She becomes a force to be reckoned with injuring one of of Sallows teammates severely but in the end gets dominated by Sallow himself  overwhelmed by the ability of the bunch she then tries to follow their trail and join them...This movie is great for it is simplicity the sport is brutal and violent but on the same level interesting to observe. The characters are fun to watch since all of them carry some unique visual aspects Delroy Lindo's character Mbulu for example has some huge bulging scars on his cheek that make him look incredibly fierce some.Each of them look so very different from their attire and look in general great costume design and make up work.You might have recognized that the plot itself is pretty basic and down to earth. It evolves wholly around the Juggers and their strive for recognition by the league. Each of them has their own motives and agendas why to do so or not to do so.To be frank only Sallow and Kidda's motives are wholly explained and overshadow the other protagonists ambitions by a long shot.The acting is on point cheesy at times but it gets the job done.Nothing fancy here and certainly not great nor bad. Some do a better job then others. I thought the young Vincent D' Onofrio was a bit over the top at times his character was overconfident and annoying but i guess that was supposed to be. Regardless He is a fine actor.Joan Chen was dull but certainly her display of agility and martial arts made up for it. very impressive indeed and I think and her actions spoke more then words.Delroy Lindo on the other hand took a backseat on this one and beside his awesome appearance did not get enough screen time to show his true potential as the fine actor that he really is. Disappointing in a way but I blame it on the script.In Case of Rutger Hauer who plays the main lead I have to say he was good but nowhere near as great as in Bladerunner. He did a good job and made the movie enjoyable.Their interesting appearances stole the show as so did the phenomenal action and the cool concept of the game. Big Kudos to the actors for pulling off a convincing portray of a sport that does not exist. It looked almost to real in many instances.If you like violent action movies and post apocalypse then do not pass on this little gem. It deserves more recognition then it currently has.".

And the rest of the cast  Last Emperor sexpot Joan Chen nude scene  whoohoo! Vincent D'Onofrio and a great supporting cast.  this is like an Alist cast slipped into a Blist video.I spent the first five minutes trying to figure out the game that the juggers play in this postnuclear future.  I spent the rest of the movie wishing there was a league today!Spoiler Alert!Rutger plays a guy ekes out a living as a jugger in the sunbleached nuclear wasteland aboveground trying to put together a team that can challenge a team Down Below in the Nine Cities that are all that's left of civilisation.Through the course of the film we learn Rutger used to be a pro jugger in the cities but was banished for loving the wrong woman.  He's on a quest to put together a team that can successfully challenge the pros Down Under and win his way back to civilization.A lot of thought must have gone into designing the game itself because it rocks.  Through the course of the film you start to see strategies and tactics.  At the end of the last game you'll be standing on your feet cheering Go team go!Or maybe not.  Maybe you're a postmodernist snob who doesn't find anything cool unless it's politically correct selfabsorbed and hopelessly hip. In which case this is not the film for you.  This is a film for men and women who love great characters a gripping plot suspense drama a love story and dynamite sports action all in one.In the interest of full disclosure I'm a Rutger Hauer fan.  But some of his films stink like weekold cheese.  Not this one  this one is slambamthank you ma'amgrrreat!  Go juggers go!".

	schema:reviewBody "An appealing and feisty Joan Chen plays Kidda a young woman in your typical ominous future. In this environment there is a popular sport otherwise known as The Game in which combatants fight each other in order to allow a qwik to make it to the other teams' goal line and score by placing a dog skull atop a stake. Rutger Hauer plays Sallow a longtime master of The Game who once played at the highest level but lost his standing when he spent time with a Lords' wife. Kidda replaces the critically injured current qwik on Hauers' team and they figure to improve their lot in life by issuing a challenge to teams still in this League.Written and directed by David Webb Peoples whose other screenwriting credits include Blade Runner Unforgiven Twelve Monkeys and Soldier this shows its audience a reasonably good time for just over an hour and a half. It doesn't really add up to much when it's all said and done coming off as pretty familiar to anybody who's watched their fair share of low budget postcivilization cinema. But The Game itself is pretty amusing and this viewer did like the certain bloody grimy and gritty aesthetic that Peoples gave this little picture. It has a definite atmosphere going for it  filmed topside in the desolate Australian area known as Coober Pedy where Pitch Black filmed 10 years later and underground in some understandably dimly lit sets it's grim without ever getting TOO grim for some tastes.The costumes music and production design are all entertaining. Hauers' team also consists of Anna Katarina Delroy Lindo Vincent Phillip D'Onofrio Gandhi MacIntyre and Justin Monjo and they're fun to watch. Aussie icons Max Fairchild Hugh KeaysByrne and Richard Norton have roles as well. Hauer is rather low key dialling down but not forgoing his typical charisma. This may be one of his finest B movie appearances.Long live the Juggers with Hauers' bunch a team worth rooting for if ever there was one.Seven out of 10.".

	schema:headline " In a world of survival art is meaningless";
	schema:reviewBody "What a brutal little film this is. We enter a desolate wasteland the scorched remains of what once was the twentieth century before the cruel wars that followed and track a band of Juggers  a sports team that roam the wastes from filthy settlement to filthy settlement challenging the population to raise a team of juggers and play 'the game!' I love that the rules of 'jugging' are never explained we simply observe and learn. There seems to be few rules  it's a primitive extremely violent version of American football except the quarterback is also the running back and the offensive linesmen swing big sticks. The defensive linesman is a big dude swinging what sort of resembles a cat o'nine tails whip made from chains. Basically the ball is a dog's skull and the object is to ram it onto a stick on the opposing side of the field. As there are no time pieces in this new world order the game is timed by throwing stones at a metal gong. If the challenger can last 100 stones without the home side dogskulling them they win. Got all that? Good. Let's move on.My favourite scene although I do like that extreme violence is when they enter the underground Red City and Hauer and Chen pass a man doing chalk art on the filthy pavement. I like how everyone just walks over his artwork paying it no heed and I also like that he doesn't object he just keeps chalking. It's a great example of showing rather than telling the audience that in a world where survival is the priority there is no room for art. No time to stop and admire beauty.I really dig other parts of this movie like the fact they make the oldest guy in their troupe lug a wardrobe full of their sht on his back across endless miles of desert. Nice. And the guys in the weird tank that stop them in the middle of the desert and basically take a ransom from them. We're not really told who these weird guys are or why Rutger and his team bow down to them and fork over their hard earned winnings without a fight or even a harsh word. Well one guy spits on the ground in protest. I also like that when a member of their team is crippled with a broken leg they just leave him there and walk off. Darwin at his most brutal. But this opens the way for Joan Chen to join the team. I also like that it's never explained why she wants to hook up with this band of violent men and trek off into the desert looking for a fight. She just felt like a change I guess. I also really like that there's neither a back story nor a bright future anywhere in sight. We know from a single title card at the start that these people don't remember how the world got fcked up and are so busy simply surviving they're not really thinking about a way to fix things. This is simply the world they exist in and world where the game is everything and the epitome of social standing is to win 100 stones! This brings me to one of my favourite bits of the movie so typically Aussie where Rutger helps the dude big Australian guy he's just pummelled to his feet and the dude remarks ShtI forgot you were better than me! No hard feelings mate. Love it.That reminds me of another favourite bit and indeed one of the best bad guygood guy moments I've ever seen. It's where Rutger is walking off after the final confrontation to return to a life of endless jugging across the desert living from meal to meal and sleep to sleep. The big Australian dude who got pummelled by Rutger asks the villainous ruler of the Red City why he's letting Rutger go. The bad guy simply muses that there's nothing more he could do to make Rutger's life any worse than it already is. What I love more is that Rutger knows it and it doesn't bother him. He's not only resigned himself to this life he's gonna enjoy it as well dammit.".

	schema:reviewBody "Set in a post apocalyptic world the people still need to be entertained. Juggers bring that entertainment playing a gladiatorial style game sort of like rugby yet nothing like it at all.The Blood of Heroes is by no means 'AList' material. It IS however gritty riveting and driven. You care about the characters. You find yourself verbally cheering them on! You want them to succeed. The Blood of Heroes does just that  succeed  and in a big way. I'm actually surprised it hasn't been remade with a larger budget considering the trend out of Hollywood these days. I have to admit to being a fanboy of Rutger Hauer. Performances by other up and coming names are also fun to watch. Add this to your list. You'll be glad you did.".

Juggers bring that entertainment playing a gladiatorial style game sort of like rugby yet nothing like it at all.The Blood of Heroes is by no means 'AList' material. It IS however gritty riveting and driven. You care about the characters. You find yourself verbally cheering them on! You want them to succeed. The Blood of Heroes does just that  succeed  and in a big way. I'm actually surprised it hasn't been remade with a larger budget considering the trend out of Hollywood these days. I have to admit to being a fanboy of Rutger Hauer. Performances by other up and coming names are also fun to watch. Add this to your list. You'll be glad you did.";

There's blood and pain at every turn. So it's not for everyone but the quality is there.The imagery costumes makeup and action are without reproach. The story might not bring anything new to the table but the world sure does and it's showed in full details. The dialogs are simple yet very effective and no quick easy slick remark jut hard harsh statements fitting the whole scene.The only reproach I would make is that the pellicle is getting old and without clean images it's getting tougher to appreciate. No widescreen no HD. Bummer. Still its age does show beyond that the rest is impeccable.If you don't mind violence see it.".

Not exactly King Lear is it? Who would watch this crap?But once you do it's an amazing experience. The game called Jugging is excellently portrayed leaving you begging to know more about its rules and the Mad Maxesque setting is brilliantly shown the futility of the world is never shoved in your face the characters are allowed to simply exist in it. Rutger Haur stars as a hard man who's very tired of his hard life and Joan Chen shines as a young girl who bites off just about all she can chew. Delroy Lindo and Vincent D'onofrio give stellar backup performances.The movie actually plays like a standard sports flick a ragtag team of misfits put aside their differences and overcome immense obstacles to get a shot at the champions in a DavidvsGoliath battle. We've all seen it before. The difference here is the sport is an vicious amalgam of football wrestling and goodol'fashioned asskicking and the world they play it in is a dead hellhole.There's not a lot you can say about this flick to get someone to want to watch it except just try it.

Rutger is a bit shallow sarcastic and viscous much like the film as a whole.The game sequences are well choreographed in their elegant brutality. Along the way to the finale in an underground redoubt populated by the last cultured' humans we're actually treated to some surprisingly noncliche character development. Instead of being a demographically and politically correct crosssection of the population you can see facets of real people you know in the characters. My personal favorite is the guy who carries a big wardrobe in his back the whole movie.The premise for the film is grand but its overall rendition is more smallscale. You can imagine what could have been done with a bigger budget in almost every scene which can make the film feel a bit small' at times. Small sets small bands of extras filling out shots small stabs of music.Ultimately though you feel the hard core that sits at this films heart and that's what it's all about.

	schema:reviewBody "The Russian film Komissar was shown in the U.S. with the translated title The Commissar 1967. It was cowritten and directed by Aleksandr Askoldov. This film wasn't released until 1988 21 years after it was produced. Not only were we deprived of the film but Aleksandr Askoldov the director was never permitted to direct a movie again. The explanation for this delay and this punishment was that the film depicted the Red Army in a negative way. That sounds realistic enough until you see the movie. To me the Red Army was depicted in a heroic fashion. There must have been subtle offenses not clear to a nonRussian.The movie is set in Ukraine where the Red and White armies clashed in the Russian Civil War. Nonna Mordyukova portrays Klavdia Vavilova a Red Army commissar who is fighting against the Whites in the postrevolutionary war. She becomes pregnant and is billeted with a Jewish family during her pregnancy. AntiSemitism lies just below the surface of the entire film. Both the Reds and the Whites were guilty of it although I believe it was worse from the Whites at that time. We don't see actual pogroms during the movie. A synagogue is boarded up when the Whites take over the town as are many houses. It wasn't clear to me whether these were all houses with Jewish families.However there's a horrific scene with three of the Jewish children terrify their own sister. They tell her to come up out of the cellars and then they shoot her with their toy weapons. Obviously they are playing out a scene that they've witnessed.The acting is outstanding throughout the film. Rolan Bykov plays the husband Yefim. It's interesting that Bykov himself was Jewish. Raisa Nedashkovskaya plays Maria Yefim's wife. Both Rykov and Nedashkovskaya are excellent actors. Yefim is a strange characterin some ways brave and in some ways childish. He'd rather dance than work and he'll break into song when one would least expect it. Maria his wife is a more traditional role. The only problem with the casting is that Nedashkovskaya is incredibly beautiful. That would work if she were a young newly married wife. However the couple live in poverty with many children to care for. Beauty doesn't last long in situations like that. Realistically Maria would be worn down and broken by that point in her life. In the movie she's still youthful and radiant.The protagonist of the film Klavdia Vavilova is a loyal Communist and she is as brave and strong as any man in the movie. In fact when she's having the baby and she's told to push she has a flashback to a moment when she and other soldiers are trying to push a heavy artillery caisson over a hill. As a mother with a newborn child she is torn between her baby and her duty to the Red Army. Nonna Mordyukova who portrays Klavdia Vavilova was a great Soviet actor. She is excellent in this role. She looks like a strong tough Ukrainian woman who would not be out of place in the Red cavalry. Director Askoldov could probably have chosen a young beauty for the role of Klavdia. Instead he went with an actor with broad shoulders and strong features. Mordyukova inhabits the role and the movie's greatness is due in large part to her work.We were very fortunate to see this film at Rochester's Dryden Theatre in the George Eastman Museum. The Dryden owns an excellent 35mm print and seeing it projected on the large screen was a wonderful experience. However it will work almost as well on a small screen. The Commissar is available on DVD. Don't miss it!".

Despite deStalinization the Soviet Union and its Communist ideals still stoodthe collective was still to be seen positively and the pure militaristic attitude of the people was still important. By introducing Commissar Klavdia as an emotionless militaristic maiden with male mannerisms at the beginning and proceeding to reveal her personal human side through her feminineness pregnancy and change of clothing as she was cared for by a Jewish family the film interprets the Revolution as a softening of Communist values. By changing Klavdia from the officer who ruthlessly sentenced a Red deserter to the tribunal at the beginning to being a scared doubtful mother who seemed unsure of whether or not the new regime would bring trams and success when the idea was challenged by Yefim Commissar is questioning the validity of Leninism altogether! It becomes a defiance not a Thaw reinterpretation which is why it likely got banned. Another huge factor to its banning may have been the heavy sympathy for the Jewish faith that it evokesantiSemitism was prominent in the Soviet Union even after Stalin. Once it was released under Gorbachev however the film was allowed to intrigue viewers with its whirling camera shots depicting Klavdia's flashbacks and its interest in the effects of the Revolution on the psychology of children by showing how messed up kids got under switching regimes.

	schema:reviewBody "From staunch militant to sensitive mother Vavilova's search for selfidentity is one that creates meaningful stories both internally and externally. She is a very curious character. With masculinity and devout patriotism as two of her defining qualities she does not subscribe to the typical female persona at least in the beginning.Each quality creates a thought provoking dynamic for how she faces internal and external wars. Her internal war is pregnancy. As the child grows within her poses a threat to her masculinity a subsequent external war is createdthat is the child additionally poses a threat to her patriotic rank as Commissar. Although both wars throw her life into a state of imbalance they also help develop her in becoming a more volitional and rounded character. In particular her internal war creates maternity and sensitivitytwo qualities that lacked in her previous commanding status.She acquires both qualities after giving birth this is depicted when singing a lullaby to her sleeping babe as well as when emotionally breastfeeding him two actions which run contrary to her initially bleak and cold persona. Her external war i.e. love of country so too created by the pregnancy introduces the most difficult challenge she has to face in the film the choice of whether to marry herself to her country by divorcing from her child or keeping her child and ridding her patriotism.What draws her to eventually side with her country is a series of haunting flashbacks and clairvoyant visions. In one specific moment while suffering through the birthing process her mind flashes to a dreary landscape filled with military soldiers who like herself struggle to push a heavy piece of artillery up the side of a steep and sandy hill. This image evokes at least one particular meaningone which acts like a stepping stone to help Vavilova make her final decision when giving up her child The collective group pushing the machine uphill is a type of not only the communist ideals that Vavilova stands for but is also a metaphor for the strenuous birthing process itself. In other words the birth of a child and the birth of a nation are equally painstaking tasksboth which require exertion i.e. masculinity and loyalty i.e. patriotism.The flashback ends with her waking up in panic repeating to herself several times Stop torturing me. These words speak on multiple levels. In one sense she is tired of being mentally tortured from the government that oppresses her with stringency. In another sense she is tired of being physically tortured during the birthing process. Rich is the emotion and meaning of this flashback and consequently it later leads to an extremely significant clairvoyant vision.During this vision she witnesses the forthcoming holocaust of WWII. She sees herself with child swaddled in arms shuffling amongst a sheepish group of Jews as they wander to their death chambers. Reluctant to follow what she sees it's as if she's asking herself while in vision Is this my fate? Her subtexual obstinacy kicks in No it can't be. She is the author of her choices and will not be subject to any deterministic beliefs. She feels she can change this outcome but she must act now. However the choice to act is a difficult one given her present circumstance. What choice does she make raise her child or fight for her country? She cannot do both for by focusing on one the other is inevitably sacrificed. Where then is optimism to be found in her utterly bleak and tortured world? The aesthetics of the film help contribute to this bleakness by the director's choice of shooting the story in black and white. Only in a world like Vavilova's are colors of the rainbow absent. The black and white look is a reflection of the coldness she feels inside empty of any optimism. Interestingly enough however the Jews surrounding her in vision seem to be optimisticthey raise their arms in an almost dancelike ritual knowing full well that death will soon embrace them all. She steps back nervously. Her body language has spoken. She remembers back on the corrupt youth that exist in her presentthe ones who so ignorantly mimic their corrupted eldersand feels an obligation to save the youth and particularly her own child from such corruption. Although most of this is more or less implied I strongly believe that this extraction is highly plausible given her final decision.She does not abandon her child though some may argue so. She leaves her child in the hands of a very nurturing family ones who she could trust since they too had nurtured her during her period of birth and even rebirth. Holding the confidence that her child will be safely watched after she returns to her former state of balance by joining the war effort. She has rediscovered her meaning place and identity in life she is a warrior. Her life cannot be lived in fairy tales like Yefim suggested when turning the war into a theatrical play for his children. Her life must be lived in truth and in truth only. That is the film's predominant theme Despite how ugly the truth of reality iseven during times of war and tortureit must be embraced and dealt with not thrown to some fantasy that creates false optimism. By living in a fairytale she potentially falls prey to becoming a victim of the holocaust by living in truth she attempts to reverse the effects of such an outcome by fighting the monster of war.".

	schema:headline " Social Deconstruction";
	schema:reviewBody "The filmography of director Aleksandr Askoldov lists a single film Commissar. After a single viewing of the film it is easy to assess why no further works exist from Askoldov. Commissar is an ambitious gutsy and subversive film. Askoldov had to have been cognizant of the imminent danger it posed against his young career. This likely awareness of the inevitability of personal ruin seemingly emboldened Askoldov to move far beyond apoliticism which was relatively acceptable to the unthinkable open hostility. When trivially compared to Chapaev the pinnacle of socialist realism thirty years prior it is apparent just how indifferent and even spiteful Commissar is towards certain parts of Soviet society. Both films share the backdrop of the Russian Civil War that is where the similarities end. Commissar not only avoids socialist realism in a time period supposedly ripe for the projection of Soviet heroism it turns the idea on its head. While Chapaev embraces the breadth of the Soviet cause against the Whites Commissar narrowly focuses on Klavdia Vavilova and the Jewish family that hosts her during her pregnancy. The fronts of each film are portrayed very differently. Chapaev embraces revolutionary romanticism. Impassioned speeches are given and camaraderie is instilled in the troops from the legendary figure himself. The only scene where Klavdia is shown with her unit she essentially condemns a man to death. She is moody heavy set and emotionally withdrawn from her comrades. The defining difference the one that provokes the comparison to begin with is Commissar's complete inversion of socialist realism's journey of the hero. Instead of the spontaneous goodhearted hero being politically educated by a Communist figure here the Communist figure undergoes a form of social education by simple goodhearted peasants. Though Vavilova verbally recites the dogma of Communism throughout the film we see how the tenderness Yefim and Maria introduce create intense internal conflict for Vavilova. The film suggests that war and the ideologies guiding them strip individuals of their inherit humanity. The family setting is an attempt at rehabilitation. Vavilova starts off talking about abortion and how she perceives her child as a parasite growing within her. Much later after living among a loving family she delivers her baby. In one of the most touching sequences of the film Vavilova paces around her room as Maria puts like a caged animal carrying her baby and singing a lullaby. The duality of her character here the callous dutiful commissar and the loving mother is perfectly illustrated by Nonna Mordyukova's nuanced complex performance. If the enlightenment of Communism is social construction the film attempts to deconstruct to reduce life to a simpler more sincere form.".

	schema:headline " Christianity in Komissar";
	schema:reviewBody "The Komissar is successful because it is thought provoking and evokes emotion from the viewer. Interestingly although this film deals with a Jewish family and various issues of Judaism the careful observer notices that the film is also full of symbols of Christianity. In fact there are so many of these examples that it leads the viewer to wonder whether the filmmaker may have intended to make a commentary on the relationship between Judaism and Christianity. Although modern Christianity and Judaism are quite different from each other they have very similar backgrounds. Indeed prior to the birth of Jesus they were both one religion and became separate because Jews refused to accept Jesus as the Messiah while Christians believed that his life was the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy.Some of the Christian symbols in the film are less conspicuous than others and blend into the film seamlessly. For example there are several scenes in the film that show crosses in the background. At one point the camera focuses on a cemetery that is filled with crosses. There are also crosses on top of churches in many scenes. The connection between Judaism and Christianity is apparent in the fact that in one scene the focus shifts back and forth between a Jewish synagogue and a Christian church which are both being boarded up.The beginning of the film is marked by the perspective of the two female characters Klavdia and Maria regarding pregnancy and childbirth. It is significant that Klavdia was an important military figure but was forced to give up her command because she was pregnant this would obviously never happen to a man. Although Maria has six children she talks openly with Klavdia about the pain of childbirth stating that it is not good for the mother the child or God. The scene where Klavdia gives birth further emphasizes the pain of childbirth. In both Jewish and Christian history the pain of childbirth is a consequence that God gave to women in response to Eve's decision to tempt Adam with the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden.There is one scene in the film that is particularly touching because it reveals the depth of the relationship between Yefim and Maria who do not show such blatant affection at any other point in the film. This is the scene where Yefim washes Maria's feet. As he does so he looks up lovingly into her eyes and says I love you. This scene is both tender and also a little shocking because throughout the rest of the film Yefim is portrayed as brusque and a little rough around the edges. This is the one time in the film when the viewer is allowed to see through his exterior. It is interesting that the filmmaker chose to use the washing of feet as the interaction between the two characters during this personal moment. The washing of feet is a symbol that relates directly back to Christianity and the Bible bringing to mind Christ washing his disciples' feet before he was crucified.The film ends with Klavdia's decision to leave her baby with Yefim and Maria. This seems ironic because their relationship did not start out well  Yefim was outraged that Klavdia was taking a room in their house and did everything that he could to resist. Despite the circumstances however a friendship developed between the characters and they learned to trust and even to like each other. Klavdia chose to leave in order to protect her child and also the family that she had come to love. She sacrificed herself in order to protect the other characters. Again this situation seems to parallel Christianity Christ sacrificed himself to protect his followers.While the main characters of this film are Jewish it seems noteworthy that there are so many similarities between different aspects of the film and Christianity. If it were only the crosses that served as symbols of Christianity that might be dismissed as part of the setting of the film and irrelevant to the story. There are however so many different parallels and religious undertones particularly Christian that it appears that they should be significant.".

Instead it offers a direct and sensitive story of a dedicated but pregnant Red Army Commissar who sometime during the 1930s finds shelter with a Jewish family and is transformed by their affection. In the end she has to choose between motherhood and the Motherland but her decision to follow military duty does nothing to diminish her new found sympathy for her surrogate family and before rejoining her company slogging through an unglamorous landscape of Ukrainian ice and mud she entrusts her baby to the care of people and by extension a tradition she has learned to love. Stylistically the film is a mix of poetic realism with occasionally selfconscious but effective montage flashbacks plus one haunting flashforward anticipating the Holocaust.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was surprised to hear that Komissar was filmed in 1967 a year when the USSR was already firmly past Kruschev's thaw and entering the repressive Brezhnev era because there is something very thawish about this film. The general criticism of war the dignity of ordinary people during a time of calamities and the juxtaposition of battles with moments of civilian life all hearken back to the ideas expressed in The Cranes are Flying 1956. As in all Soviet cinema many of the central ideas are expressed through symbolism. This makes the film somewhat difficult for viewers who are not used to this style but most people tend to find it refreshing and psychologically stimulating. It certainly prompts more postfilm discussions than current American cinema that simply shoves the director's point of view down the audience's throat.Some of the themes that I found particularly interesting were the use of the innocence of children to depict the horror of war the image of saddled horses without riders galloping into battle and of course the father dancing in the midst of a bomb raid. Most of all I thought that the change in Vavilova  going from a rough battle hardened Red Army officer to a nurturing mother is the most poignant aspect of this film. The scene where Vavilova is hunted my soldiers for having a child mimics her own persecution of a man who leaves the army to be with his beloved. The soldiers turn out to be figments of her imagination but the point is obvious. However Vavilova's decision in the end of the film which I will not reveal for fear of getting blacklisted by the IMDb NKVD is puzzling in light of the changes in her character. I suppose that Askoldov's opinion that a person's nature cannot be changed by one experience is contrary to my own optimism. Still I find the end to be somewhat unrealistic.".

	schema:headline " Religious symbols in Komissar";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the reasons that Commissar was initially banned in the Soviet Union was the use of religious imagery in the film. One example of this is shortly after Vavilova the Commissar has her baby. She walks by a graveyard and the Russian Orthodox crosses are prominently featured in the shot. This can be interpreted to mean that Vavilova was forced to carry the baby which she initially considers a burden in the same manner that Christ had to carry His cross. It could also symbolize the idea of a life cycle where Vavilova just had a child and is then seen at the cemetery where she is surrounded by death. Another instance where crosses appear in the film was when Vavilova Yefim the father of the Jewish family she is forced to stay with and his family were boarding up the windows and doors to prepare for the White Army soldiers that were coming. In one shot Yefim is nailing a beam across a window perpendicular to another board which clearly makes the shape of a cross.The other major example of religion that can be found in the film is when Vavilova travels to the priest and then to where the synagogue had been. She does this in order to have her baby baptized or recognized in the Jewish religion. This would not have sat well with Soviet censors seeing a strong female Commissar traveling in search of someone to baptize her child. I found this scene particularly moving because it seemed that Vavilova simply asked the priest for directions and would rather have had her baby brought up to be Jewish. This shows the positive impact that Yefim and his family had on Vavilova during her stay.".

One example of this is shortly after Vavilova the Commissar has her baby. She walks by a graveyard and the Russian Orthodox crosses are prominently featured in the shot. This can be interpreted to mean that Vavilova was forced to carry the baby which she initially considers a burden in the same manner that Christ had to carry His cross. It could also symbolize the idea of a life cycle where Vavilova just had a child and is then seen at the cemetery where she is surrounded by death. Another instance where crosses appear in the film was when Vavilova Yefim the father of the Jewish family she is forced to stay with and his family were boarding up the windows and doors to prepare for the White Army soldiers that were coming. In one shot Yefim is nailing a beam across a window perpendicular to another board which clearly makes the shape of a cross.The other major example of religion that can be found in the film is when Vavilova travels to the priest and then to where the synagogue had been. She does this in order to have her baby baptized or recognized in the Jewish religion. This would not have sat well with Soviet censors seeing a strong female Commissar traveling in search of someone to baptize her child. I found this scene particularly moving because it seemed that Vavilova simply asked the priest for directions and would rather have had her baby brought up to be Jewish. This shows the positive impact that Yefim and his family had on Vavilova during her stay.";

Her cheerfulness and kindness provide a welcome reprieve from the grimness of the film as does to some extent her husband Yefim's incongruous singing.  Even Maria and Yefim's children are forced to grow up quickly I found disturbing their playacting of the military harassing and killing Jewish people.I was surprised when the film ended to me it was sudden and missing at least one or more final scenes.  I understand that the original 1967 film was actually not finished till the 1980s or 1990s.  Apparently the film was also banned in the former Soviet Union until Glasnost.  Komissar leaves one with silence and not hope for the Russian Jewish peasants and laborers or any kind of vision of a peaceful and productive future for anybody.I did enjoy the skillfully subtle camera angles and landscapes. The actors gave strong and convincing performances.  I also appreciated that the film could have justified being quite violent but instead left most of the violence suggested and not graphic.  Overall I'd give the film a rating of 5 out of 10  neither good nor bad giving a good and perhaps realistic view into this period of history but lacking a stronger plot.".

	schema:reviewBody "Commissar directed by Aleksandr Askoldov is a 1967 Soviet film based on one of Vasily Grossman's short stories. The story is set during the Russian Civil War and centers around a female commissar of the Red Army cavalry Vavilova who is introduced to the audience as a brutal soldier shooting a deserter with zero remorse. The audience clearly sees her inhumane nature when she finds herself pregnant and mentions how she would have gotten rid of it if only she had known earlier. Finding herself pregnant and due to deliver her baby any day she is forced to stay with a not so well off Jewish family who is at the beginning is reluctant to accept her staying with them. Through her time with this family her character makes a drastic change as she now embraces motherhood and life as a woman. One of the many themes in this film is the effect war has had on adults and children alike. The husband who is exhausted from constantly working while earning very little but has to feed seven children. The wife who has to do all the house chores. In one scene the children aggressively bully and begin to wage a mock pogrom on their older sister by tying her to a swing and swaying her back and forth. The action could have only been possible by observing the actions of soldiers. Although the family is caught in all this chaos Askoldov manages to capture the warm nature of family life through the slow panning of the children and their parents sleeping as well as them dancing together. Askoldov finds ways to dramatize particular scenes one noticeable moment is the scene of Vavilova struggling during her delivery which is paralleled with a scene of a group of soldiers struggling to push a wagon. Also the scene where the soldiers are drinking water after succeeding to push the wagon and the scene where Vavilova drinks water when she succeeds in giving birth. This film did not adhere to the honorable vision of Soviet life in war along with the aftermath that the party officials desired the world to see. The audience is made aware of the Soviet Unions role in the holocaust which is captured in a striking dream sequence near the end of the film where the Jewish family is happily dancing and the moment is cut short as we see the family wearing stars walking with other Jews to what seems to be a concentration camp.".

	schema:reviewBody "Commissar boasts the best soundtrack of any movie I have seen so far and the cinematography is wonderful. It has come a long way since earlier Soviet films in which the camera is frantically switching back and forth. Specifically the shots at the start of the film present a detailed scenery while at the end we see more focused views like when the horses are pulling supplies.But my favorite feature of the film has to be the ambiguous ending. We aren't told if Klavdia survives and comes back to her child or of its fate. This is a twist from similar movies. In Ivan's childhood we find out that Ivan is dead at the end of the film. In Ballad of a Soldier we know our soldier is already dead. That's not to say we don't feel for these characters but there's little left to the viewer. All the information is given to us in the film  we aren't asked Do you believe Alexei survives and returns home after the war? He doesn't. That automatically sets the tone for the rest of the film. With Commissar we can ask ourselves Is this a hopeful film or a darker one? It's true that it has its share of conflict but we can choose to believe the characters are happy at the end if we want. We do still know what ultimately happens historically but the characters can be separate from that.Where the movie is flawed for me is in its simplistic setup. A woman needs to rely on people she is hesitant to trust and ends up trusting them. That's a great plot line but for 60 minutes not 103 minutes. As I watched the movie I couldn't help but feel it could have done more with its time. In Ballad of a Soldier there are multiple stages to the journey each different. In Cranes Are Flying the story is about Veronika but switches to very distinct scenes of Boris as well as focusing on the characters' lives before during and after the war. Here we see Klavdia at the village and that's about it. Yes we see the village before and after the conflict and Klavdia before and after she gives birth but it could have been better still. We could have seen Klavdia's soldiers trying to make do without her. Or a view of the White Army. The film is solid and stands on its own but it feels like more could have been made.".
