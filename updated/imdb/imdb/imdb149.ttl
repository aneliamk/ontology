I think that the scene when Mifune's character is performing a tea ceremony in front of the army that is to go to battle next day and most probably perish is unsurpassed in beauty and laconic but forceful expression.It is also a story of conflict between art and power and one more proof of the independence of art and of an artist's courage. The film shows that one can rebel in one's art and the effect will be much greater than any other form of rebellion. It is also a tale of human dignity and the tragic solitude of a man in the transitory world.

	schema:reviewBody "The movie is about one of the deepest mystery in Japanese history about the death of Sen No Rikyu the founder of Japanese tea ceremony and the Senke tea ceremony schools.For many ages there has been two mystery surrounding the death of tea ceremony master Sen No Rikyu. First is why Hideyoshi the then ruler of Japan ordered him to commit seppuku harakiri and second what was going through Rikyu's mind when he obliged to slit his belly.The movie is a tale told by Honkakubou Rikyu's closest disciple. The movie tells the tale of the final meeting between the two at the last days of Sen No Rikyu's life. The Rikyu in this movie supposedly told Honkakubou that each tea person has their own path. This is the path for Rikyu and for no one else. The movie also speculates that the reason for Hideyoshi ordering Rikyu to commit seppuku is because Rikyu has presented his opinion against Hideyoshi's plan to invade Korea. I am not qualified to comment on the tea culture that this man has created and its impact on the Japanese culture but I can understand the difficulty of figuring out these two mysteries surrounding Sen No Rikyu after almost 500 years has past. More common understanding is that the influence Rikyu had on various people in power at the time was feared by Hideyoshi who was starting to be a paranoid schizophrenic and him and Hideyoshi didn't see eye to eye or Hideyoshi was suspicious of conspiracy by Rikyu imaginary or otherwise. Since Hideyoshi was the then ruler of Japan Rikyu had no other choice but to oblige and commit seppuku.The story is therefore a pure speculation and is not based on any new found evidence in recent years. The movie meanders due to lack of focus on the facts. Compared to more recent movies made by the Chinese on their legendary figures like the Assasin that delved into the life of Cao Cao the movie is weak in its thesis and production. The story was mostly melodramatic and didn't have much substance. Toshiro Mifune puts in good performance as Rikyu. He put dignity to the character of Rikyu as we would expect him to be.It's an okay production on the death of Sen No Rikyu but probably a better job could be done to show the life and philosophy of one of the greatest cultural master of all times.".

	schema:headline " Feels like a Bittersweet Tea... Recreates the period beautifully..!";
	schema:reviewBody "A magnificent work of Japanese cinematic art starring Mifune Toshiro. It tells the story of what led to the death of Sen no Rikyu the influential sixteenthcentury tea master who served the warlord Hideyoshi. Drawn from the pages of Japanese history! In Kei Kumai's vision on this subject a tension can be established between the physical and the spiritual between the shadow of the forces and the perspective and the acquisition of wisdom when compared to Hiroshi Teshigahara's Rikyu which leaned more on the political and social context while Death of a Tea Master focused on the philosophy. The cinematography is spectacular of being impressed. The vivid color pattern in some scenes which contrasts somewhat with the somewhat somber vision of some of his other features would later be recovered in some passages in The Sea Is Watching 2002. The movies dialogue is brief and to the point. Some statements are very profound and uses symbolism to push the narrative. This production was the great turning point in Kei Kumai's career. Not in the sense of its aesthetics or in the sense of remuneration or recognition but in terms of its objective in cinema. One of the best films ever made in Japan. One of the greatest productions in world cinema with moderate budget and it captures the very essence of its title thoroughly justifying it etches out characters. And this is why the ending plays as the perfect emotional payoff for a film so full of frustrating inhibitions a light of hope after an eternity spent.

	onyx:emotionText "A magnificent work of Japanese cinematic art starring Mifune Toshiro. It tells the story of what led to the death of Sen no Rikyu the influential sixteenthcentury tea master who served the warlord Hideyoshi. Drawn from the pages of Japanese history! In Kei Kumai's vision on this subject a tension can be established between the physical and the spiritual between the shadow of the forces and the perspective and the acquisition of wisdom when compared to Hiroshi Teshigahara's Rikyu which leaned more on the political and social context while Death of a Tea Master focused on the philosophy. The cinematography is spectacular of being impressed. The vivid color pattern in some scenes which contrasts somewhat with the somewhat somber vision of some of his other features would later be recovered in some passages in The Sea Is Watching 2002. The movies dialogue is brief and to the point. Some statements are very profound and uses symbolism to push the narrative. This production was the great turning point in Kei Kumai's career. Not in the sense of its aesthetics or in the sense of remuneration or recognition but in terms of its objective in cinema. One of the best films ever made in Japan. One of the greatest productions in world cinema with moderate budget and it captures the very essence of its title thoroughly justifying it etches out characters. And this is why the ending plays as the perfect emotional payoff for a film so full of frustrating inhibitions a light of hope after an eternity spent. Strongly recommended if you love arthouse cinema and especially if samurai dramas are your thing.";

	schema:headline " My first experience with Jerry Cotton";
	schema:reviewBody "This is my first experience with Jerry Cotton and overall I enjoyed Death in a Red Jaguar. It's got a lot of faults but there were enough good quirky moments to make it worthwhile. In this one FBI Agent Jerry Cotton George Nader is called in to investigate a series of murders. In each case the person with the greatest motive also has the best alibi. Cotton believes that there must be a murderforhire group responsible for the murders. After much chasing and a few more deaths Cotton decides the best way to stop the group is to make himself a target. Had I not known going in I could have told you after about five minutes that Death in a Red Jaguar was at least in part a German production. It just had that 60sera German feel to it. I can't really describe it like I said it's just a feeling. The plot in this one is interesting enough to hold it all together. There are plenty of chases murders and suspects to keep things hopping. And the main killer was especially creepy which really helped the first half of the film. I've always enjoyed Nader's work when he pops up in a movie I'm watching. He's usually good however by 1968 he was getting a bit old to play this kind of role. The supporting cast is nice though some aren't helped by the dubbing. The voice used for Daniela Surina's Ria Payne character was a bit like listening to a female Foghorn Leghorn. I'm from the South and no on speaks like that. I loved all the rear projection shots designed to make it look like the film was set in California. Awesome stuff. Finally the ending was very satisfactory. Even though I knew who the mastermind behind the murders was it was still fun to watch Cotton catch him. Looking forward to checking out more Jerry Cotton.".

	schema:reviewBody "Der Tod im roten Jaguar or Death in the Red Jaguar is a West German Italian coproduction that resulted in this Germanlanguage film from 1968 which will have its 50th anniversary two years from now.

Like most his other works this one here is in color and focuses on one man in particular Jerry Cotton. He is an FBI agent who keeps solving crimes. That's basically all you need to know. here and there we see a gunfight some attractive young women and fast sports cars like the one mentioned here in the title. There are quite a lot German films from back then even if most of these really aren't that famous. This one here is possibly the most known today. It's also the first I saw from the franchise except the new one starring Christian Tramitz and I cannot say it got me curious about any of the others. It wasn't a failure but the plot and acting did not really convince me. I also felt that George Nader was maybe too old for the character especially in the face of these young attractive women surrounding him. Overall this film was too generic and uninspired for my taste. I do not recommend seeing these 90 minutes. Thumbs down.".

	schema:headline " Altman's mischievous take on a cinema archetype";
	schema:reviewBody "The very embodiment of '70s Hollywood genre revisionism Robert Altman's film of The Long Goodbye stands as one of his most accessible wittily misanthropic films and probably the finest performance of Elliot Gould's career to date.A warning for Raymond Chandler purists you probably won't like this film. Altman and screenwriter Leigh Brackett had quite a task in adapting Chandler's secondlast novel to the screen for in it the 'knight errant' Phillip Marlowe comes over more like a prudish sap. Altman and Brackett have streamlined the narrative removed peripheral characters and  crucially  transformed Marlowe into a murkier more comically ambiguous protagonist.In Altman's and Gould's hands Marlowe is laconically relaxed murmuring alternately amused and annoyed at the world. Like Chandler's hero he is an outsider a spectator everywhere he goes. Unlike the literary Marlowe Gould's character seems washed up on the shores of an unfamiliar land his nobility as crumpled and stale as his suit.Along for the ride are the archetypal Chandler villains and victims selfhating celebrities young wives trapped in loveless marriages crooked doctors lowrent psychopathic gangsters bored cops flunkies lost out of time. Typically the milieux Marlowe moves in range from the affluence of the Malibu Colony to the cells of the County Jail. Altman however wishes to make a film in and about 1973 the film is shot through with the psychic reverberations of the end of hippiedom and the remoteness of the 'Me Generation'.Another Altman touch is his openly expressed contempt for Hollywood and its conventions. As if to acknowledge the artificiality of a private detective story in the midst of 1970s Los Angeles the film is suffused with jokey references to cinema. Bookended with 'Hooray for Hollywood' the film shows gatekeepers impersonating movie stars characters changing their names for added class hoods enacting movie clichs simply because that's where they learnt to behave. Even Marlowe himself refers to the artifice when talking to the cops 'Is this where I'm supposed to say 'What's all this about?' and he says 'Shut up I ask the questions' ?'As for the supporting cast Sterling Hayden shines out as the beleaguered novelist Roger Wade. There is more than a touch of Hemingway in Hayden's bluff blustering vulnerable old hack. Baseball champ and sportscaster Jim Bouton is casually mysterious as Marlowe's friend Terry Lennox LaughIn alumnus Henry Gibson is suitably greasy as Dr Verringer actordirector Mark Rydell best known for 'On Golden Pond' is convincingly chilling as gangster Marty Augustine and Nina van Pallandt lends a dignified defiant pathos to her role as Eileen Wade.Special note must be made of Vilmos Zsigmond's tremendous photography employing his early 'flashing' style of exposure to lend Los Angeles a suitably sultry bleachedout aura. Also deserving attention is John Williams' ingeniously minimalist score. Comprised solely of pseudosource music the score is a myriad of variations on a single song appearing here as supermarket muzak there as a party singalong elsewhere as a late night radio tune.The film's controversial ending is utterly antithetical to Chandler's vision. The message from Altman however is loud and clear Chandler's world no longer exists  if indeed it ever did.".

	schema:headline " Quirky Atmospheric Unique Altman Spin to Chandler!";
	schema:reviewBody "I admit when I first viewed The Long Goodbye in 1973 I didn't like the film the signature Altman touches rambling storyline cartoonish characters dialog that fades in and out seemed illsuited to a hardboiled detective movie and Elliott Gould as Philip Marlowe? No WAY! Bogie had been perfect Dick Powell nearly as good but M.A.S.H.'s 'Trapper John'? Too ethnic too 'hip' too 'Altman'! Well seeing it again nearly 34 years later I now realize I was totally wrong! The film is brilliant a carefullycrafted color Noir with Gould truly remarkable as a man of morals in a period the 1970s lacking morality. Perhaps it isn't Raymond Chandler but I don't think he'd have minded Altman's 'spin' at all! In the first sequence of the film Marlowe's cat wakes him to be fed out of cat food the detective drives to an allnight grocery only to discover the cat's favorite brand is out of stock so he attempts to fool the cat emptying another brand into an empty can of 'her' food. The cat isn't fooled by the deception however and runs away for good...A simple scene one I thought was simply Altman quirkiness in '73...but in fact it neatly foreshadows the major theme of the film betrayal by a friend and the price. As events unfold Marlowe would uncover treachery a multitude of lies and selfserving amoral characters attempting to 'fool' him...with his resolution decisive abrupt and totally unexpected! The casting is firstrate. Elliott Gould Altman's only choice as Marlowe actually works extremely well BECAUSE he is against 'type'. Mumbling bemused a cigarette eternally between his lips he gives the detective a bluecollar integrity that plays beautifully off the snobbish Malibu 'suspects'. And what an array of characters they are! From a grandiosely 'overthetop' alcoholic writer Sterling Hayden in a role intended for Dan Blocker who passed away before filming began to his sophisticated longsuffering wife Nina Van Pallandt to a thuggish Jewish gangster attempting to be genteel Mark Rydell to a smug health guru Henry Gibson to Marlowe's cocky childhood buddy Jim Bouton...everyone has an agenda and the detective must plow through all the deception to uncover the truth.There are a couple of notable cameos Arnold Schwarzenegger in only his second film displays his massive physique as a silent mustached henchman and David Carradine plays a philosophical cell mate after Marlowe 'cracks wise' to the cops.The film was a failure when released Altman blamed poor marketing with the studio promoting it as a 'traditional' detective flick and audiences including me expecting a Bogartlike Marlowe. Time has however allowed the movie to succeed on it's own merits and it is today considered a classic.So please give the film a second look...You may discover a new favorite in an old film!".

	schema:reviewBody "It's true. You can't have mixed feelings about The Long Goodbye you'll either love it or hate it. I started the movie with what I pretended was an open mind but a secret hope that I'd be fully justified in hating it. In my defense The Maltese Falcon is my favorite movie and Bogie is my favorite actor. Noir is my favorite film genre and I love Howard Hawk's The Big Sleep wihich had Bogart as the definitive Marlowe.Altman's take on Chandler's other book with private eye Marlowe The Long Goodbye updates the action to the 1970's. He introduces a very 70's theme song and finds as different an actor as he can from Bogart for the role of Marlowe. From the opening frame Elliot Gould plays Marlowe like a pushover. He's a man who constantly mutters to himself suffers nervous tics can't even fool his cat is afraid of dog's and seems to be the only man not attracted to his sexy hippie neighbors despite their friendliness towards him and obvious promiscuousness.However Gould really creates a unique persona with the way he walks talks wisecracks and operates. He becomes a believable person  which is why the uncharacteristic ending is so impacting. The photography especially the night scenes are beautifully filmed. The theme music plays everywhere  a Mexican funeral a doorbell a car radio etc and with different singers. There are other layers of flesh added to the telling that really work  like the compound security guards impressions of James Stewart Barbara Stanwyck Cary Grant and best of all Walter Brennan aka Stumpy from Rio Bravo.This movie worked great for me and the plot intricate though it was was understandable. I will not compare this Marlowe to Bogart's but do find it admirable that Altman just stuck to the goal of making a good movie without trying to ape or make obvious references to the noir genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "Much like the 30's jazz music that opens the movie The Long Goodbye appears on the surface to take its cue from classic film noir. No surprise here it is based after all on the Raymond Chandler novel by the same name Chandler as iconic a figure in the noir realm as you're likely to get and responsible for some of the most distinctly classic moments of the genre Double Indemnity The Big Sleep also Strangers on a Train for Hitchcock. But instead of rehashing styles and themes from a bygone era of filmmaking Altman instead takes Chandler's film noir of wandering and hangs on it his own unique take.Elliot Gould is Phillip Marlowe. Scruffy sardonic and alienated private dick with a smart mouth and a cigarette eternally glued to his lips. Altman's twist? He's cool but not the suave kind that would impress dames in the 40's the Bogart kind. He seems constantly out of place a bit phased doomed to observe and comment in his witty repartee on what's going on around him or just let the chips fall where they may. And they do.Chandler's story is one of his very best. All the staples of noir are present simultaneously fulfilling the promise of a Phillip Marlowe film and in the same time preparing the ground for Altman's take on it murder missing money unhappy marriages a private eye hired to investigate. The works. Sprawling and convoluted like the best of noirs usually are. The dialogue crackling with inventiveness shedding tough guy lingo for a sense of playfulness rolling in and out of the picture in a streamofconsciousness way.Some of the twists and characters seem to carry a sense of seething malice a fleeting glimpse on the seamy underbelly of the Great American Beast the scars and ugliness of Hollywood showing behind a faded facade of glamour an escalating creepiness factor that recalls the later works of David Lynch predating him by a good number of years as it does. The mousey Dr. Verringe and the whole clinic subplot reminded me of Lost Highway for example.What really elevates The Long Goodbye in another level is Altman's direction and he has Vilmos Zsigmond with him. This is only my second Altman picture after McCabe and Mrs. Miller but 2 hours in his presence were enough to leave an indelible sense that I'm watching the work of a master on top of his craft. Altman's camera is always on the move slowly panning and floating in and out of the frame picking up details guiding the eye but never getting in the middle of the story or screaming for attention. The whole thing has a natural subdued feel to it what with the unobtrusive lighting and bleachedout hazy look no glitz or glamour here. Only the faded longgone impression of it. This is a world we are enmeshed in that surrounds from all sides with hazy reflection.The Long Goodbye is both a fantastic and somewhat hidden gem of 70's crime cinema and also one of the missing links in the evolution of noir all the way from Sunset Blvd. to Mullholland Drive. You must visit at some point.".

The Long Goodbye is a fine transition in style to Altmans later films like Nashville and A Wedding Elliot Gould does an outstanding job portraying the outre detective Phillip Marlowe using his mumbling bumbling smart ass speaking style as a technique to keep the film under the illusion that everything is in motion like the ocean waves in the film Marlowe speaks in a sort of beatnik type DaddyO style combined with a smooth talking private eye and the result works perfectly.  The film works like it is timed by a metronome it rolls along seamlessly in a way that only Altman can achieve and like the rhythm of the waves and Marlowe's speech the camera is constantly in motion as well. The roving camera does an excellent job of allowing the viewer to feel as though they are witnessing more action than actually exists on screen.Wade Sterling Hayden is a fantastic Hemingwayesque writer in the film. Hayden's size and booming voice in conjunction with his alcoholism and potential brutality lend an aroma of unpredictableness to his character. Wade's beautiful wife who has a mysterious bruise on her face is like a timid loyal animal subjected to the whims of her over bearing master. Henry Gibson who plays Wade's doctor is excellent as a sort of despotic mouse who frightens an elephant into conforming to his will this irony is one of the films intriguing bizarre twists.This film works well as a character study and is one of the best films of the seventies.

But nowadays the viewer must see the film for its great direction terrific performances Leigh Brackett's excellent screenplay and the fine cinematography. Not to mention simply the challenge of understanding a truly baffling plot. As in all of Altman's works this one is peppered with offbeat characters and subtle and some notso subtle situations that positively take you by surprise.  As a maverick figure in Hollywood Altman made sure iconoclast was stamped all over this film it's a true nosethumbing at every institution that Hollywood reveres idealistic movie heroes neat happyeverafter endings big budget spectacles dependable moneymaking conventions and all around asskissing.But the real treat here is of course Elliott Gould and I don't believe that it's the best thing he's ever done on screen as many think.  He's certainly turned out even better performances than this one throughout the past 3 decades.  But yet in The Long Goodbye Gould is just so much fun to watch especially when he's being interrogated by the police or just muttering lines like He's got a girl I got a cat or a melon convention when he gives up trying to get his topless nextdoor neighbors' attention.An interesting thing to note at the end of the film  we see the back shot of Marlowe walking away and that to me was the private eye's closing shot but then we have a front shot of Elliott Gould who begins playing his harmonica and then continues on up the road doing his little number dancing a jig etc.  And to me that shows where Marlowe left off and where Gould takes over.  So they weren't one and the same after all.  Once again a statement to those who would be too quick to take the Marlowe myth seriously.The Long Goodbye is vintage Altman a masterwork to be savoured forever.".

If you're not won over by the overall approach then it is unlikely that you will find a lot more to fill the time.Altman's direction is focused on the style and although he is fairly respectful to the material in regards what happens he doesn't go out of his way to make it engaging. Gould fits the role well and enjoys his character. I would have liked more of the complexity underneath to come through to contrast with this surface. He is the film but he is well supported by a hammy show from Sterling and solid turns from Rydell Pallandt Gibson and Bouton.Overall then a difficult film to really like. It has enough of its own style to be interesting but not enough of a hook in the narrative to please a mass audience.

I understand that adapting a book to film means making concessions but I don't think there is a single line of dialogue from the book in this film. If you like Chandler then you know it's his dialog that makes him such an outstanding writer and more than just a pulpfiction hack.I can also understand changing the plot but this movie removes so much of the original and changes not only the storyline but the characters and motivations that it becomes incoherent. I mean why make Mexican gangsters in the book into Jewish ones in the film? It takes away from the reasoning of Lennox's flight to Mexico. There is never any real understanding of why or how Lennox and Marlowe met or became friends. There are a whole group of characters left out which gave meaning to story. Without any understanding of the characters the plot doesn't make sense and the changes take away from the understanding and make the motivations weak.Although the story was updated to the 1970's the look and feel is more of an early 1960's film. It wasn't avantgarde but already outdated when it came out.Some people like the soundtrack but I find the one song in it's numerous variations very insipid. Hearing each version over and over again only point out how awful a song it is. It comes off as a cheap trick.So even on its own terms this movie is very weak and frustrating and as Chandler film it will make aficionados cringe.".

	schema:headline " Marlowe the Loser";
	schema:reviewBody "The first and only screen rendering of 'The Long Goodbye' is not Grandma's vision of Philip Marlowe but it's a break from convention that pays off. Innovative for its time in both direction and cinematography the film still holds considerable weight in an era when detective stories have dropped off the radar.Adapted from a screenplay by Leigh Brackett of 'The Big Sleep' fame Robert Altman's 1973 thriller bases itself on an imaginative premise that succeeds thanks to excellent directing and the versatility of its cast. As Altman has many times explained the 1940ish Philip Marlowe wakes up one morning to find himself in early 1970s Los Angeles a city drenched in LSD yoga and capitalism gone mad. The hardboiled storytelling of Chandler is stood on its head becoming a sort of expressionist montage Marlowe adrift in a society he doesn't understand and can't be bothered trying to figure out.In this film as in others inspired by Chandler character development becomes more important than plot because so much is happening. 'The Long Goodbye' uses the formula of a private detective who is misled and sent full circle. After an earlymorning struggle with his cat Marlowe drives his other 'friend' Terry Lennox Jim Bouton to the Mexican border and is soon taken into custody by the police who explain that Lennox's wife had been murdered. Marlowe is released from jail and reads in a newspaper of Terry's apparent suicide in Mexico. While disbelieving either story  it's his 'friend' after all  Marlowe is called on a new case to the Malibu development where Terry lived. The client is Eileen Wade Nina Van Pallandt whose drunk authorhusband Roger Sterling Hayden wandered off to a rehab facility without telling her. Marlowe's investigation hits some potholes when a local drug boss Mark Rydell jockeys for several thousand dollars in cash that Lennox toted across the border and Marlowe knew nothing about. Leigh Brackett ties up the loose ends in uncanny fashion with an ending different from the original novel and quite surprising.Chandler purists will find this movie hard to swallow especially the opening halfhour when all detective story conventions are flipped into the trash. Elliott Gould who paired with Altman in 1970's MASH is not the dynamic suave Marlowe of other films. Instead he is an unkempt crackpot who finds solace in his pet cat and drives around in an old bulky Lincoln convertible. The Gould version of Marlowe is okay at his work but only good enough to stay in one piece or as few chunks as humanly possible. He smokes incessantly is bewildered by those around him and can't win the respect of anybody. While a Marlowe of this type is hard to imagine Chandler's novel actually supplies the needed atmosphere for Altman's idea to work. 'The Long Goodbye' is another Chandler tale with a bewildering series of events where characters brush collide and overlap. The L.A. of Chandler is so overloaded with deceit that you have to forget action and start concentrating on motive.The Long Goodbye's outstanding feature is its look as a pseudonoir if such a thing were possible. The visuals by cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond including his use of 'postflash' technique give this film a subdued tone reminding us that Marlowe was created in the past but is living and breathing in the present. There is a certain Deco feel to the movie emphasizing straight lines and pastel colors. The use of Malibu locations helps retain an exotic look for Chandler's story much like his palm treefilled backgrounds of the 40s.Style leads the way in Altmandirected films which bring strong love or intense hatred from viewers. There are indeed moments when we're begging Altman to step away and let the movie take care of itself. Altman's use of a freemoving camera may be as distracting to an audience as this initially was to the actors. The film's theme song by John Williams and Johnny Mercer is pleasing and fits the mood nicely but it's just about the only melody heard. It keeps changing form based on the situation  sometimes a jazz theme sometimes a funeral march sometimes a doorbell ringing. The soundtrack which Altman admitted was a 'conceit' is in need of diversifying itself and reaches a point of overkill. But on the whole this film is a leader of early 1970s craftsmanship and Chandler's writings never fail to generate sparks.MGM Home Entertainment outdid itself when releasing its DVD of 'The Long Goodbye' in 2002. The film is nicely presented in widescreen with Dolby enhancement of the original mono track French 'dubbing' is provided along with subtitles in English French and Spanish. MGM supplies featurette interviews with Altman Gould and Vilmos Zsigmond who first photographed with Altman on 'McCabe and Mrs. Miller' in 1971. Also reprinted is a 1973 American Cinematographer article on Zsigmond's postflash photography that was revolutionary for its day. Completing this disc are the original theatrical trailer and five radio commercials used during The Long Goodbye's advertising campaign. For fans of Altman and the detective genre you can't go wrong with an unusually full disc from the MGM pennypinchers. out of 4".

The seventies setting does allow Altman to throw in some topless coed neighbours apparently for the titillation no pun intended of the crew.The production value is questionable. Gould mumbles his lines and a lot of it seems dubbed. Even then you have to strain to hear the dialogue much of the time. The film has a cheesy madeforTV look that is not all down to being made in the 1970s.All great directors have their flops and Altman is no exception. Peter Biskind cites rumours that Altman was drunk much of the time on set. I can only assume he was out of his skull shooting this one.".

His 'Hemingwayesque' alcoholic rages are violent visceral and disturbing and yet he contains a brittle fragility that draws you to his performance.The shining light though is Altman. Not only did he get the best career performances out of his finely assembled ensemble did Gould Hayden or Van Pallant ever do better? but also produced one of the best shot films of all time. Only bettered in this era by Coppola's The Conversation not a bad film to come second to.On top of all this is an overwhelming sense of the auteur the soundtrack camera work and acting performances all combine to create a synthesis of near perfect cinema.Turn your computer off run out of the house and rentsteal or buy this film.

Now after seeing this film many times I can say without hesitation that this is a masterpiece an Altman is a master of his craft.I think that if it was made according to the book it would be long forgotten.The film is all about masks misleading and misinterpretation.These are the bases of P.I. s' movies and as Marlowe says all over the film That's alright with me but when it gets to Marlow's inner circle and ruins its basic beliefs its not alright anymore.The cynical mask Marlowe wore in the relatively naive 40' so he could cope with the harsh reality then isnt enough for the sober 70'and he had to change it to an indifferent clown mask. He think he could get away with this mask but the treacherous reality gets to him at last. Eliot Gould is terrific in this roleUnlike many reviewers I think the real Chandler's Marlow without the masks is revealed in the finale scene with Terry.Nina Van Planndat who played Eileen Wade was known as the misstress of a wellknown hoaxer at the time and that contributed to her enigmatic role.She plays the fragile beaten woman The blond femme fatale. Sterling Hyden is great as full of rage and bad manners Roger Wade.These impressions are of course all masks but Marlowe fails to interpret them right until its too late.  The only one who doesn't wear mask is augustine Mark Rydel in a real horrific performanceand he is the key for solving the mystery.Dont expect a Marlowe regular. this film reflects the mood of one of the worst eras in US recent history and its dark soul is masked by colors and brilliant directing and performance.".

In addition the theme song gets played in just about every situation and in various forms  it gets very irritating very quickly.Ends well though with a good twist and a powerful conclusion.A new take on Philip Marlowe from Elliott Gould  he is hardly Humphrey Bogart and he's not trying to be. Altman's Philip Marlowe is the dishevelled antisocial chainsmoking antihero rather than the suave confident hero that Bogart portrayed. For the most part it works though at times I wished for the coolness and wisecracks of Bogie. Supporting cast are fine. Sterling Hayden is great as the largerthanlife Ernest HemingwayJohn Hustonesque Roger Wade. Not the Philip Marlowe of the Bogart movies but it'll do.".

	schema:reviewBody "The movies got around to adapting Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe novels fairly early. The first in the series The Big Sleep was published in 1939 followed fairly quickly by Farewell My Lovely The High Window and The Lady In The Lake and by 1947 all four had been filmed  twice each in the case of the latter two. By common consensus George Montgomery was the worst Marlowe and the film in which he took the role The High Window the worst adaptation. That held good until Robert Altman decided he was qualified to reinvent Chandler and Boy! did he get a wrong number. I can't name one single aspect that says 'Chandler' in this piece of crap. Elliot Gould resembles Chandler's Philip Marlowe a tad less than Tom Cruise resembles Shakespeare's King Lear. Not that this is necessarily Gould's fault. Presumably he played the role as directed just as equally presumably Leigh Brackett  who had of course cowritten the screenplay for the BogieHawks version of The Big Sleep  wrote this Marlowe as instructed by Altman. I don't object to any director for whatever reason making a travesty of an accepted genre but I do object when a director acquires the rights of a wellknown wellloved novel and throws out virtually everything that made it great in the first place. Why not simply write andor commission an Original Screenplay and have done with it. This Marlowe is phony from shot 1. Clearly inspired by Paul Newman's Harper who was shown as a slob from the off this Marlowe is portrayed hungover chainsmoking and living in something one level up from a rat hole. Chandler's Marlowe on the other hand always maintained a tidy apartment and cooked real meals. It's a small point I agree but as John O'Hara once said if you get the small things right you'll get the big things right. The very first line of the novel reads The first time I saw Terry Lennox he was drunk in a Rolls Royce outside the Players restaurant. From this Chandler explores the growing friendship between the two men. Here Lennox turns up at Marlowe's apartment out of the blue about two reels in displaying nothing of the breeding and raffish charm that made Marlowe invest time in him. The link between Lennox and the Wades is clumsy and inept here where it was subtle in the novel. Lennox' military past in which he was one of three men on a wartime mission is omitted and a gangster who wasn't in the book is substituted for the two that were. Neither is there any mention of Lennox' fatherinlaw Harlan Potter to say nothing of his other daughter who Marlowe would actually marry in a later novel. The final insult is of course to have Marlowe conceived and written as a modern day knight doing his best to right the world's wrongs kill Lennox in cold blood. The sooner this is turned into banjo pics the better.".

	schema:headline " Immensely influential take on Chandler";
	schema:reviewBody "Altman's take on Chandler seems increasingly influential as the years go by. His film takes the form of a detective story but the story doesn't really go anywhere ... or more precisely goes a whole lot of places just to end up back where it started. The pleasure here isn't in the mechanics of the story so much as having these characters interact in laid back 1970's California and have something like a plot emerge from their interactions.

His film takes the form of a detective story but the story doesn't really go anywhere ... or more precisely goes a whole lot of places just to end up back where it started. The pleasure here isn't in the mechanics of the story so much as having these characters interact in laid back 1970's California and have something like a plot emerge from their interactions.

It deals with downonhisluck detective Philip Marlowe Elliot Gould  he improvised some scenes as when he smears fingerprint ink all over his face and original choices for this character were Lee Marvin and Robert Mitchum tries to help a friend who is accused of murdering his wife . Following the reported suicide in Mexico of a friend a gorgeous woman first Englishlanguage film of Danish actress Nina van Pallandt hires him to locate her alcoholic and mercurial husband called Roger Wade Sterling Hayden  this role had originally cast Altman's friend Dan Blocker but he died before filming commenced . Then Marlowe being interrogated by Police Inspectors . The wisecracking eye private becomes involved into a dark world of killing  treason and leading in twisted results .This enjoyable  hardboiled though overlong film packs thrills  suspense  mayhem  some nice touches an exciting plot in evertwisting directions  using that crisp Raymond Chandler narrative . Interesting adaptation by screenwriter Leigh Brackett who twentyseven years earlier cowrote the script for the classic The big sleep 1946. The picture offers a nicely detailed scenarios from Malibu in fact  the location for Sterling Hayden's home was actually Robert Altman's home at the time and the name of the private estate was Malibu Colony. The movie was part of a predominantly 1970s revival cycle of pictures adapted from novels by Raymond Chandler . Likable acting by Elliot Gould as tough and cynical eye private . This was one of five movies actor Elliott Gould made with director Robert Altman  the films include M.A.S.H. 1970 Nashville 1975 The player 1992and California Split 1974 . Very good support cast as Nina Van Pallandt is stunning as a Femme Fatale and sensational Sterling Hayden as her drank husband . There appears uncredited a bearded David Carradine and Arnold Schwarzenegger as a muscleman but has no lines in the film . And special mention to director Mark Rydell as a violent Jewish mobster  he returned to acting for this movie after an absence of around a decade. Atmospheric as well as jokey musical score by the great John Williams  precollaboration to Spielberg  all the music in this film is different arrangements of the theme tune. Colorful cinematography by magnificent cameraman Vilmos Zsigmond  the camera is always moving  there are no static shots in the movie  Vilmos tried to approximate human vision through the postproduction technique of exposing the undeveloped negative to additional pure light which literally dampens blacks and softens intense colors . Other films about this famous detective are the followings  Murder my sweet1944 by Edward Dmytryck starred by Dick Powell   The Big Sleep version directed by Howard Hawks with Humphrey Bogart  Big sleep by Michael Winner with Robert Mitchum  Marlowe by Paul Bogart with James Garner  Farewell my lovely by Dick Richards with Robert Mitchum . The motion picture was well directed by Robert Altman . At the beginning Altman realized Shorts and he then went to Hollywood to direct Alfred Hitchcock's TV show . From here he went on to direct a large number of television shows until he was offered the script for M.A.S.H. 1970 in 1969. He was hardly the producer's first choice  more than fifteen other directors had already turned it down . This wasn't his first movie but it was his first success . After that he had his share of hits and misses but The prayer 1992 and more recently Gosford Park 2001 were particularly well .".

Altman is at his most dangerous here with lots of silly sight gags much obviously improvised dialog and actors sometimes visibly intoxicated.

Let us not forget that Mitchum starred in OUT OF THE PAST at least as good a detective movie as any '40s Chandler effort with the possible exception of DOUBLE INDEMNITY.

Many people call it a tribute to Hitchcock other people call it a ripoff of Hitchcock some people think it's a parody.... I think it's more than any of those things I think it's an analysis. A humorous insightful essay on Hitchcock... Kind of like something Godard might do which isn't surprising when you realize that Godard is also a big influence on De Palma. The distancing techniques employed in the film the way he hams it up the scenes where the internal logic breaks down in obvious ways like the kissing scene near the tunnel where the movie suddenly reenacts the famous hotel kiss from the second half of vertigo at a very unexpected time with almost no set up to make the scene believable... All these things are intentional designed to let the audience in on the fact that this is not just a straight forward movie although it can be enjoyed that way. De Palma wants the audience to have some separation from the story so that they can look at the movie in a more critical way and think about Hitchcock's movies from a different perspective. These distancing techniques also allow de Palma to get away with some pretty harshsleazy scenes and that was necessary because the analysis wouldn't have worked any other way.This is basically De Palma saying what if Vertigo and Rear Window had a baby but the baby was born in the 80's and raised by a prostitute and a murderous pimp. The result is a fascinating movie that stands up very well as long as you understand the intentions. If you take it the right way it's one of De Palma's very best movies.As a big fan of vertigo and rear window vertigo is my favorite movie of all time it was fascinating to me to see De Palma rework those story's twine them together and put them in a different context. I really enjoyed it both times I've watched it and I'm pretty sure it's one of those movies that will just keep getting better with repeated viewing.".

	schema:headline " De Palma's lurid and outrageous thriller hits all the right marks as more of a satire or parody than a fullon thriller and magnificently so";
	schema:reviewBody "With Body Double Brian De Palma has another of his Hitchcock ripoffs but in quotes as it's the easy critical thing that's already been said by others. The film is really a lot more cunning than that and has a level of cunning wit that one could more associate with De Palma's early comedies that felt very much about skewering the style being homaged as opposed to incurious methods. If one looks at it as much as a big wink and a nod to films like Rear Window and especially Vertigo with a lot of direct jabs at Hollywood and the whole method of acting and pretending there's a lot on the table. It's also tasteless in its outrageous depictions of sensuality and seduction not just sex which gets a lot of wicked moments that veer almost totally into what's being made fun of and has a huge gotcha ending that works specifically for its shock value. It's own selfconsciousness is a huge asset as when De Palma is at his best or at least most assertive in this case pushing the taboo of mixing regular dramatic fiction with softcore porno to a limit with glee.It's not even that one can't take it sort of seriously as a work of kindof popart as in taking in the outlandish brilliance of a much betterthanaverage paperback book because De Palma is on his toes the whole time in crafting a melodramatic thriller. There's even an experiment in tension which starts as an long homage to the 'following' sequences in Vertigo but then building to a high crescendo and then to another. In fact Body Double is silent for a lot of the time but as something that is worked into the main character. Craig Wasson is a perfect foil for the events that unfold around him as the witness to all that comes before his watchful eye in a befriended man's apartment. In what is to be sure fairly typical material for the director with the basics of the substance the story calling back to Hi Mom and Sisters especially hence as well the connection to the knowing dips into comedy of which both of those could be considered as though this time the 'hero' is a of weakling with panic attacks at the moment to act albeit already an actor. A murder is witnessed following a pivotal plot point and highflying moment of romance again calling attention to its overlength then the dive into porno comes around.It's trashy sure but why shouldn't that make it more enjoyable if one's to get the kidding and sharp sensibility after a while? Wasson looking a bit like a double of Bill Maher sometimes has the expression of terror in his eyes and a kind of strange guts needed to pull off a hilariously flawed pawn. De Palma also intentionally casts to type with both women and the villains one for each being more deceptive i.e. Henry's Brouchard and Shelton's Gloria who are very much like movie caricatures from the craftiest and most seductive of filmnoir and with one 'villain' called the Indian donning a face that's a riot just to look at who at one point engages in a murder including the most blatant phallic imagery in any murder scene from the filmmaker. But again it all works exceptionally for rhythm and a sort of momentum build into even the smaller moments. As cheesily 80's as it is I loved the whole music video Relax where occasionally as De Palma almost makes us forget that a movie is being shot within this scene the camera shooting Wasson and Griffith comes into view in a mirror. But that's just a sly joke as opposed to the scenes where suspense and humor get the back and forth treatment where you aren't sure whether to laugh or cringe or look at the screen through closed fingers peeking out.I can actually understand some of the negative criticisms of Body Double. I probably wouldn't be so forgiving of it being so proudly 'Bmovie' while appearing to be a big Hollywood crimedrama if I wasn't at least intrigued on the outset from the sensibility behind it all. 'Guilty Pleasure' comes to mind as a defense but I should digress into what it really comes down to either you'll go along for a De Palma atmosphere that is wild and cynical and full of roughedges or you won't. In other instances with the director I've gone for the latter but this isn't one of them. One of the best of 1984.".

A murder is witnessed following a pivotal plot point and highflying moment of romance again calling attention to its overlength then the dive into porno comes around.It's trashy sure but why shouldn't that make it more enjoyable if one's to get the kidding and sharp sensibility after a while? Wasson looking a bit like a double of Bill Maher sometimes has the expression of terror in his eyes and a kind of strange guts needed to pull off a hilariously flawed pawn. De Palma also intentionally casts to type with both women and the villains one for each being more deceptive i.e. Henry's Brouchard and Shelton's Gloria who are very much like movie caricatures from the craftiest and most seductive of filmnoir and with one 'villain' called the Indian donning a face that's a riot just to look at who at one point engages in a murder including the most blatant phallic imagery in any murder scene from the filmmaker. But again it all works exceptionally for rhythm and a sort of momentum build into even the smaller moments. As cheesily 80's as it is I loved the whole music video Relax where occasionally as De Palma almost makes us forget that a movie is being shot within this scene the camera shooting Wasson and Griffith comes into view in a mirror. But that's just a sly joke as opposed to the scenes where suspense and humor get the back and forth treatment where you aren't sure whether to laugh or cringe or look at the screen through closed fingers peeking out.I can actually understand some of the negative criticisms of Body Double. I probably wouldn't be so forgiving of it being so proudly 'Bmovie' while appearing to be a big Hollywood crimedrama if I wasn't at least intrigued on the outset from the sensibility behind it all. 'Guilty Pleasure' comes to mind as a defense but I should digress into what it really comes down to either you'll go along for a De Palma atmosphere that is wild and cynical and full of roughedges or you won't. In other instances with the director I've gone for the latter but this isn't one of them. One of the best of 1984.";

De Palma set up those two basic ideas into a story that's really enjoyable and intense same time. Especially when you are in the knowledge of the movies of the 40s and 50s and the art of making a thriller you are just going to be pleased.My guess is that De Palma made this movie out of pure pleasure doing all those great stuff with claustrophobia sexual need voyeurism grotesque murder and most of all terrifying suspense.The murder sequence was in my opinion of a well crafted exercise in suspense. You fear then you hope then you try to guess it goes all right then all wrong the hero comes it seems at right time but still too late it all goes on and on and you can't believe it happened. Loved and hated the sequence for filmmaking and emotional purposes.Not the greatest but definitely one of De Palmas best.".

No cheap jokes please!To my surprise this is actually a compelling wellcrafted thriller. Let me take it a step further. It's an improvement over DePalma's effective but overpraised Dressed to Kill. Body Double is actually betterconstructed and betterpaced. Perhaps the extremes of the film's content turned off some members of the critical community. And keep in mind that many of these people loved Dressed.However if you can stomach some of the content it would certainly warrant an NC17 in today's climate there's much to like here. DePalma's approach might be manipulative but when he does so this effectively it's hard to complain. Technically it's a marvel of film technique. Wasson's claustrophobic attacks are effectively conveyed to the viewer. When they hit him they hit us just as hard. The very ending which I wouldn't dream of giving away is a work of pure genius. The infamous drill murder is a terrific setpiece.One aspect that interested me was its attitude towards porno. Socalled dirty movies are not condemned but treated as simply being another side of the film industry. It's not considered right or wrong it's just there. Such a nonjudgmental outlook is refreshing after hearing the tiresome rants of selfappointed moral watchdogs. Likewise there is a loving tribute to Bmovies during the opening and closing credits.Body Double isn't good art by any means but it's good trash.

	schema:reviewBody "I was introduced to Brian De Palma at the rather tender age of 7 when I watched The Untouchables with my parents. My friend Nicky and I enjoyed it immensely and found the rousing tale of Elliot Ness et al. an absolutely brilliant cop v. robberadventure movie. Until Tim Burton released Batman in 1989 Untouchables was our game of choice and we would reenact the entire movie in my back yard after school.But I'm supposed to be talking about Body Double... To make a long story short since I was 7 I didn't know who Brian De Palma was nor did I really care so I went about my cinephillic youth without completely immersing myself in his oeuvre. I caught bits and pieces of it encountering Scarface as a fourteenyearold and finding it laughable watching Sisters with how apropos my sister before I went off to college and finding it intriguing and finally seeing Femme Fatale when it was released a couple years ago and thinking it amazing.So as you can see I grew into De Palma and since watching Femme Fatale I've gone back and watched many of his films even Phantom of the Paradise which was an epiphany  go see it immediately. I rewatched Scarface Carrie Blowout Wise Guys the Untouchables etc. and then this week I saw Body Double at the video store. The cover art which is horrible drew me in. I said Jason that cover art is so tacky and the movie is called Body Double it must be awful. Flipping the case over what should I find? De Palma.Oh my. I scooped it up then and there went home and popped it in the player. How had I not heard of this film? Probably because 23 of the natural world finds it a trashy piece of filth. I find it brilliant.It is your typical De Palma suspense thriller. Riffs on Hitchcock beautifully fluid camera movements sexual 'dysfunction' an exploration of voyeurism Hollywood satire a convoluted and endearingly unbelievable story...So why watch it? Because unlike most movies Body Double cannot seem to take itself too seriously. Body Double moves forward with a straight face but as evidenced by the Frankie Goes to Hollywood video somehow slipped into this film and an awful rubber mask De Palma's tongue is so firmly in his cheek it's liable to break through the skin. Could a film that's credits hearken back to the EC Comics font really intend to be taken seriously? No. Oh and for you scenesters out there QT may have found inspiration for his first film's title in Body Double's final scene which you guessed it contains both a reservoir and dogs.And yet although the movie on some level parodies the preposterous suspense thrillers of yore it also never condescends to them. De Palma directs this movie with such glee and exuberance that you know he loves those types of movies well I mean if Phantom of the Paradise Sisters and Dressed to Kill hadn't let the cat out of the bag already.Anyway if you enjoy maverick directors unafraid of genrepictures fun and enormous drills this is a movie for you. However if you like Lars Von Trier or other such beings who take themselves and their art far too seriously at times go elsewhere.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rating 12 out of 4.Brian De Palma has had it with his critics and the rating's board. After the cuts that needed to be made to his masterpieces like DRESSED TO KILL and SCARFACE which eventually got to be released in its intended format inconspicuously the line is drawn. So naturally he would make a movie about it. The result is BODY DOUBLE a big thumbinthenose to Hollywood conventions and 80's popculture. It's onepart Hitchcockian thriller and onepart satire but its an allaround crazy movie.If you despise De Palma chances are you'd consider BODY DOUBLE as one of his worst. Here De Palma doesn't give a damn if you get him or not. Here he revels in who he is and what he wants. He also intentionally throws in the trashy 80's fad at the time from a tacked in music video of Frankie Goes to Hollywood's onehit wonder Relax to the voyeuristic obsession with porn as the sufficient atmosphere as well as a social critique of the era. The story which basically riffs VERTIGO and REAR WINDOW has a Bmovie actor named Jake Scully Bill Maher lookalike Craig Wasson who has a very bad day when first he gets fired from his only Bmovie gig and later sees her girlfriend in bed with another man. Discouraged he bumps into a friend named Sam Bouchard Gregg Henry the most noticeable Hey isn't he that guy? character actor appearing in De Palma's films who invites him to watch over his place a campylooking tower mansion that looks like it came out of an episode of LOST IN SPACE. While there Sam introduces him to his favorite neighbor a beautiful woman named Glora Revelle Deborah Shelton who does a striptease in her bedroom not knowing she's being watched. Every night Jake would watch Gloria doing her routine like clockwork through a telescope which is harmless perverted fun until he realizes that her life may be in danger danger in the form of a weirdlooking Indian! who's spying on her too.It may take a lot of suspension of disbelief to understand the plot of BODY DOUBLE as it goes to even crazier heights. At first it looks like the usual De PalmaasHitchcock thriller with some terrific sequences then it turns into something out of a slasher film then enters the sleazy world of 80's pornography where a young Melanie Griffith plays Holly Body a porn star who may be a key to solving the crime. But when people realize that this is meant to be a thrillercumsatirical comedy they might enjoy it more. As usual De Palma demonstrates his talents with staging miseenscene in sequences like when Jake stalks Gloria who is being stalked by the Indian which is obviously borrowed from VERTIGO but is actually a little more voyeuristic in nature here and there's the REAR WINDOWinspired scene where Jake spies on Gloria while she's doing her striptease routine backed up by a catchy score by Pino Donaggio.Overall it's not meant to be taken seriously. It's only a movie! Hitchcock once said to some of his difficult actors and this movie screams that mantra. Wasson's character was meant to be a an average loser and his casting isn't just coincidence he was meant to play the audience's surrogate. The film being set in Hollywood is another. And is it no wonder that the director that Dennis Franz plays is a direct copy of De Palma? BODY DOUBLE thumbs its nose at Hollywood and many popculture fads of the era turning out to be both a sleazy reworking of Hitchcock's classics and a clever satire.".

Just as a camera is a sublimation of the gun to photograph someone is a subliminal murder  a soft murder appropriate to a sad frightened time.  Susan Sontag Today's fad is often tomorrow's joke but Brian De Palma's Body Double is something else entirely. The film was treated as a serious vulgar and pornographic thriller when it was released. Flash forward several decades though with audiences now desensitised to sex and violence and Double reveals itself to be totally hilarious a far cry from the more conservative blockbusters of the 1980s.The plot? Craig Wasson plays Jake Scully a Bmovie actor who finds himself struggling to film a scene in a coffin. Whilst director Alfred Hitchcock had Jimmy Stewart suffer from vertigo in Vertigo De Palma has Scully suffer from claustrophobia both men unable to perform due to their respective phobias.This is where De Palma begins to hit us with various levels of selfreference Scully a struggling actor within the film is played by Craig Wasson a struggling actor in real life. De Palma then has Wasson act intentionally cheesy his character can only win roles in Bmovies whilst also mimicking James Stewart in Vertigo. In a filmography of clueless heroes Scully is thus De Palma's most comical always out of place and always radiating a goofy sense of decency.The film then reveals itself to be obsessed with doubles and doppelgangers each character imbued with a second persona. And so De Palma will have friends turn out to be villains neighbours turn out to be porn stars and have his two major female characters turn out to be doubles of doubles as they themselves mimic Kim Novak's dual character in Vertigo. Even minor characters Scully's wifebossmentor etc exhibit 180degree turns in personality.This being De Palma the film is also a giant thesis on Hitchcock. On the superficial side De Palma uses proudly goofy rear screen projection an allusion to Hitch's overreliance on the technique names Scully after Vertigo's Scotty uses comically lush music and has Melanie Griffith daughter of Tippi Hedren Birds Marnie etc play a key role.More significantly De Palma rips 3 sequences right out of Hitchcock's Rear Window and Vertigo pushing them to their sleazy logical conclusions. So instead of Jimmy Stewart stalking Kim Novak we get Scully stalking a woman in a mall stealing her panties and spying as she changes her clothes. Similarly instead of Stewart watching his murderous male neighbour with binoculars we get Scully spying on his sexy female neighbour as she dances naked. Finally instead of Hitchcock's camera circling Novak and Stewart as they kiss we get De Palma's camera giddily circling Scully and Deborah Shelton as he fondles her exposed bra.These sequences don't only tease out the dark underbellies of Hitchcockian voyeurism though but ask us to consider the relationships between voyeurism desire manipulation and violence. De Palma makes this clearest when he has his hero watch a porn movie after a female neighbour dies one fantasy woman essentially replacing the other. Unable to look or even kill in real life Scully thus immediately seeks out decontexualised voyeurismviolence via film and television the real life fantasy immediately traded for the mediated surrogate fantasy. De Palma symbolises this link by cross cutting between Scully's fantasy lovemaking with his neighbour and the actual raw sex he has with a porn star as illusion and reality merge in a literal climax.A filmwithinafilm sequence in which Scully encounters Melanie Griffith dancing and tells her that he likes to watch her itself becomes an X rated parody of De Palma's Body Double in which Scully likes to watch his neighbour which is itself a soft core parody of Hitchcock a director whom De Palma likes to watch. All three levels of fantasy are linked with Hitchcock's famous 360camera pan a move which for both directors often signifies obsession.Early in the film during an actors workshop session in which Scully recounts a tale of being trapped behind a fridge the birth of his claustrophobia a teacher yells You've got to act! the implication being that Scully can only conquer his fears through acting. Scully then dies at the end of the film and is miraculously brought back to life by the power of acting roleplaying essentially giving him the confidence to conquer his phobias. For De Palma the distance or detachment afforded by film voyeurism etc allows us to participate in mediated fantasies which we would ordinarily be too timid to directly participate in. Film allows us our own body doubles our own avatars and through them we then learn how to desire.Other neat scenes abound De Palma treats us to a Relax Don't Do It! music video sequence a softcore parody of a scene in An American in Paris which anticipates the Coen Brothers and Tarantino by a solid decade. The film also begins and ends with deliberate deconstructions tricking the audience into accepting scenes at face value and then breaking down the reality of a film set's goings on. And as is typical of De Palma special attention is paid to architecture. De Palma loves modernist buildings his camera gliding down corridors up stairs and along walls. Here he uses John Lautner's famous Chemosphere house LA's Farmer's Market Mall and a interesting looking terraced apartment complex by the beach.8.910  Probably the cheesiest avantgarde film ever made.".

Even when moving away from Hitch like movies he created a storm with Scarface 1983 so the critics of 1984 wondered if a return to suspense thriller territory would put the director back on an even cinematic keel? Not a bit of it! The reaction to Body Double was ridiculously over the top apparently a misogynistic homage to the porn industry with exploitation gore thrown in for good bad measure Body Double was the devil's spawn in the eyes of critics. The public? Not so much film was a sure fire hit at the box office.Of course today it seems all very tame where not even a simulated drilling killing can raise the temperature of the audience or that frank sexual language and bare bodies no longer makes cinema goers blush. On reflection now it's easy to view De Palma's movie as a visionary piece of work a film gently poking the ribs of Hollywood and the MPAA and as was always the case with his 70s and 80s work he was a director who easily elicited a response from his audience. And with his box of cinematic tricks still impressive before he became over reliant on them Body Double is a fascinatingly lurid viewing experience.That it's Vertigo and Rear Window spliced together is a given but that doesn't make it a bad film besides which it bears the De Palma stamp as well undeniably so. Plot finds Jake Scully Wasson a struggling actor with claustrophobia thrust into a world of murder obsession deceit and paranoia for when he house sits for a newly acquired friend he spies a sexy lady through the telescope apparently being stalked by an odd looking Native American. To reveal more would spoil the fun of anyone watching for the first time but suffice to say that Jake has entered the realm where neonoir protagonists wander around wondering how and why they are in this mess.It's pulpy and pappy but in the best ways possible and unlike many other films made by directors who ventured into similar territory it's never boring hello Sliver. Cast are appropriately cartoonish or animated the twists fun if not hard to see coming and with De Palma's visual panache cosying up nicely with Donaggio's musical score Body Double is fine entertainment brought to us by a director with a glint in his eye. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't believe that critics panned this movie when it came out. I have to give director Brian De Palma for his eyes for beauty and crisp cinematography. Jake Craig Wilson is s struggling actor with claustrophobia. One day he gets invited to house sit a house that belongs to a guy named Sam Gregg Henry who he met while looking for a place to live. Across the street on his Hollywood hills home is a woman who dances away each night in a skimpy attire. Not knowing that he's being set up to be a witness he watches her with a telescope each night.Holly Malany Griffith supposedly is Gloria Deborah Shelton's body double in this movie but what's not clear is where was Gloria when Holly was dancing away in her room each night. Ex miss USA Deborah Shelton looks gorgeous in this movie.Body double's idea might have originated from the movie Flash Dance where the word became famous due to Jennifer Beals using a body double to do the dancing scenes. Beautifully shot around some of the most luscious places in Southern California the movie is a eye candy to watch. If the plot was better fleshed out it would have been even better.One of the Hollywood classic that deserves a watch by all cult classic fans.".

Not knowing that he's being set up to be a witness he watches her with a telescope each night.Holly Malany Griffith supposedly is Gloria Deborah Shelton's body double in this movie but what's not clear is where was Gloria when Holly was dancing away in her room each night. Ex miss USA Deborah Shelton looks gorgeous in this movie.Body double's idea might have originated from the movie Flash Dance where the word became famous due to Jennifer Beals using a body double to do the dancing scenes. Beautifully shot around some of the most luscious places in Southern California the movie is a eye candy to watch. If the plot was better fleshed out it would have been even better.One of the Hollywood classic that deserves a watch by all cult classic fans.";

	schema:reviewBody "Brian De Palma's Body Double is an extremely entertaining thriller which reflects the decade in which it was released by being full of excess and completely over the top. The 1980s was a time when it was often said that if something's worth doing it's worth overdoing and on the evidence of this movie De Palma was clearly on message. The plot contains numerous enjoyable twists and involves murder voyeurism and duplicity. It also however tests the boundaries of good taste in the passages where it becomes particularly lurid and prurient.Jake Scully Craig Wasson is a claustrophobic actor who loses his job on a vampire movie because of his affliction and then returns home to find his unfaithful girlfriend in flagrante delicto. This leaves him without a roof over his head but not for long because soon another actor offers him a housesitting job. His friend also helpfully points out an apartment close by where a beautiful woman performs a striptease routine in front of her window every night at the same time. Jake watches the nightly performances by Gloria Revelle Deborah Shelton and after he witnesses her murder becomes a suspect.Jake soon realises that he's been set up and his attempts to find the real perpetrator bring him into contact with a porn star called Holly Body Melanie Griffith who has the information he needs to confirm the killer's identity.Brian De Palma is an exceptional talent who creates great visual moments and skilfully constructs long sequences without dialogue which brilliantly generate atmosphere whilst also moving the story forward. His frequent use of Hitchcockian influences is well recognised and Body Double is no exception. The plot has elements which are reminiscent of Vertigo Rear Window and also to a lesser extent Psycho. The presence of doubles disguises women in danger confused identities black humour and a significant amount of audience manipulation are also additional influences from the same source. Hitchcock's fear of being buried alive inspires a couple of scenes and the inclusion of Melanie Griffith in the cast is an additional link to the great director as she is the daughter of one of Hitchcock's leading ladies Tippi Hedren.Criag Wasson is good as the confused and creepy Scully and Deborah Shelton has a remoteness which fits in well with the dreaminess of some of her scenes. Melanie Griffith is also bubbly and amusing in the movie's strongest performance as she successfully brings to life the full range of Holly's qualities.".

I view the film with an artistic eye but I also view it with an acknowledgment that it captures a certain loneliness that I've seen here in LA. I've met women similar to Gloria Revelle. It captures that isolation people can find themselves in here and that is punctuated perfectly with the slightly dreamy yearning music. The lighting is beautiful the acting is excellent by everyone in the film and the way the film is shot.....it is beautiful to look at. I think critics of this film are forgetting that this is cinema.

	schema:reviewBody "An absorbing thriller? Toiletpaper absorbs well too.That's it this is definitely the last De Palma thriller I have masochised myself with. Note This turned out to be incorrect I saw some more. I must be a masochist after all. The moment I read the opening titles crediting De Palma for both story and screenplay I knew what was in store. It's an inevitable mathematical equation A De Palma Story  Thriller  Absurd Garbage. The film intended to thrive on its plot twists is as predictable as the dumbest Bmovie.I knew that the moment Wasson was being watched during acting class by the eventual murderer that he would screw him over. I knew that the dancingwoman and the telescope were a setup. It was also pretty obvious that someone was hiding behind a mask of the socalled Indian. Indian?? The mask looks nothing like that of an Indian! And it looks nothing like a face  it's obviously a mask. And who else could be hiding behind the mask but the murdered woman's husband! The end of the film consists of a series of scenes whose sole purpose is not to make sense or explain anything but to confuse the viewer as much as possible. By the time the last  ridiculous  scene takes place nothing in this pile of garbage made any sense whatsoever. BD also has a very cheap 80s look to it.There are so many dumb DePalmesqian goingson it is hard to remember them all. But I've tried 1 Wasson follows the mystery woman and ends up in an elevator with her and some other people these people see the Indian and practically show no reaction at all to his face i.e. mask.2 The woman escorts Wasson outside of the tunnel and then after exchanging just a few words they start kissing and feeling each other up passionately  one of De Palma's male fantasies this scene is stupid absurd illogical  in short a typical De Palma scene.3 When the Indian attempts? to strangle his wife he falls on the bed unconscious!  why did he fall unconscious? If he was just buying time then why? He didn't need to wait for Wasson to reach the house Wasson's telephone call was proof enough that Wasson was already witnessing everything.4 After his wife got up from the nearstrangulation why did she not run out of the house or at least see how her intruder was doing? She simply turns her back to him and proceeds to call the police. Dumb dumb dumb.5 When detectives arrive they behave like unprofessional idiots not very credible and awfully annoying as it insults the intelligent viewer's intelligence.6 When Wasson calls a detective a few days later to give him new information on the murder case the detective just laughs him off! Now what detective in his right mind would just laugh off a main witness in a murder investigation who is providing more information?! 7 During the interview a detective just happens to see the woman's underwear hanging out of Wesson's pocket. He inexplicably picked it right out of a trash bin shortly after the woman threw it there. I hate cheap plotdevices.8 Wasson just happens to be watching a porno channel on which he sees Griffith who is an important factor in the puzzle. What a coincidence.9 Wasson somehow manages to recognize Griffith's dance movements in the porno as being identical to those he saw on his first peepingtom evening farfetched to the point where it's just not funny any more.10 Wasson only needs to contact Griffith but how does he do that? He does it by actually applying for a part in a porno with her doing a scene with her pretending to be some sort of a porno producerpimp and luring her to the apartment! Couldn't he have simply talked to her?! The characterization is awful there is no indication at all that Wasson would be the type to just so casually hop into a porno. 11 When Wasson sees the Indian attacking Griffith in a car in front of his he gets out to try to save her but a cop stops him! and ignores his claims that someone is being killed in the car in front!! This is the most mindbogglingly idiotic scene in the entire film. De Palma's perception of cops is that of mindless imbeciles who dismiss claims of murder as easily as De Palma dismisses logic from his scripts.12 The entire scene of Wasson shooting the porno is awfully unconvincing. De Palma's perception and portrayal of the porno industry is naive and ludicrous.13 When he saves Griffith at the end she isn't thankful but actually asks who it was that she was saved from! Are we supposed to believe she suffered some kind of amnesia that made her forget the Indian who had just kidnapped her and tried to kill her?! De Palma even tries to add humour occasionally in this and a couple of other scenes none of it is any good.De Palma appears to write his scripts with no plan no preparation no research and with absolutely no intention to make sure that any of the pieces of crap fit together. He just makes things up as he goes along which is fine for drama or comedy but for mystery thrillers you need more cohesiveness than that.The confusing ending isn't the work of a master director it is a sad attempt to add ambiguity and appear as though he is a director making a statement. De Palma is far too unintellectual to go around making statements with his largely exploitative thrill flicks. The ending is nothing but a cheap copout.".

The setup of the witness right at the beginning is so painfully obvious that I watched the film only in hope that I was wrong the murder itself would be a joke if only it were actually funny and the witness's reaction to the murder is absurdly inappropriate. If you want to paint someone into corner to have them not call the police it has to be better than merely that they don't want to admit peeping with a telescope. This is murder  after all let's respect that with some adequate explanations. That also applies to motive You don't kill your beautiful young rich wife for the insurance  rich people don't need life insurance. If anything you just kill them for their money straight up. But why in the first place? I need a real motive folks. Actually  I need a real film which this is not.".

If you want to paint someone into corner to have them not call the police it has to be better than merely that they don't want to admit peeping with a telescope. This is murder  after all let's respect that with some adequate explanations. That also applies to motive You don't kill your beautiful young rich wife for the insurance  rich people don't need life insurance. If anything you just kill them for their money straight up. But why in the first place? I need a real motive folks. Actually  I need a real film which this is not.";

There are some beautiful sequences but I always felt like I was watching someone imitating Hitchcock...DePalma never put his own style into films until later. There's also a needlessly long sequence where Wasson is stalking somebody.

Also there's a particularly sick sequence where someone is drilled to death and it's shown as a phallic instrument! Also the story in this is just ridiculousthe ultimate solution to what's going on is to say the least implausible. Even the ending is terribleit doesn't make a lot of sense and ends with a closeup of breasts with blood pouring down them! Wasson is terrible in his role too.The only saving grace here is Melanie Griffith playing a porno actress named Holly Body. She's just great and energizes the movie. Especially good is a sequence where she tells Wasson what she will and will not do in a movie. Also they somehow fit the 80s group Frankie Goes to Hollywood into this performing the song Relax for a porno film! It sounds ridiculous but it's a GREAT sequence and really energizes the film.But ultimately this is a dull film. Stupid implausible slow a least a half hour too long. It caused a lot of controversy when first released but it died down quickly. DePalma I heard doesn't like this film himself. I give it a 1.".

Later on  there takes place some exciting scenes of men fighting to the death .This Western contains actionpacked  ruthless characters  quickfire  violence  rapacious revenge  slaughter  shoot'em up and results to be quite entertaining  though drags at times  balancing in ups and downs . A good example of Latino western genre from Italy and Spain  it is daring  a notoriously violent Spaghetti  so extreme in every way  it is one of the handful of Italian Western that abounded in the 60s and early 70s . This moving Spaghetti packs noisy action  thrills  crossfire  twists and turns with exciting final . There is a very odd implementation of shots in the camera work during some particular scenes as the film approaches its climax  as in the ending and the unusual conclusion . Arizona Si Scaten.. Li Fece Fuori Tutti or Arizona Colt returns results to be a following to a character played by Giuliano Gemma in Arizona Colt1966 by Michele Lupo starred by Gemma  Corinne Marchand  Andrea Bosic and again Roberto Camardiel and Rosalba Neri . Well starred by Anthony Steffen  he may be a name best remembered by Spaghetti Western aficionados but in his day from the mid'60s to the early '70s Steffen was one of the most popular actors of the genre  at the time cheap B movies now revered cult classics. The handsome Italianborn  actually at the Brazilian embassy in Rome  Antonio Luiz de Teff von Hoonholtz began working in films as a studio messenger for Vittorio De Sica. From there Steffen began acting in swordandsandal epics later moving onto the Western genre where he found his niche. Unlike fellow Spaghetti star Clint Eastwood however Steffen never became a top international boxoffice attraction. It's a thrilling western with screenplay by the notorious Ernesto Gastaldi  including a breathtaking confrontation between the protagonist Anthony Steffen against the heartless Aldo Sambrell and his hoodlums such as Luis Barboo  Ralph Baldassarre  Dan van Husen and Fernando Bilbao . Exciting Spaghetti Western and it is proceeded in violent style and ordinary narration . The film packs thrills  gunplay and high bodycount  it's fast moving  quite entertaining and including bursting with explosive violence . Being a SpanishItalian coproduction  here appears familiar faces from Chorizo or Paella or Tortilla Western such as Aldo Sambrell  Luis Barboo  Fernando Bilbao and the sympathetic Robert Camardiel as costarring . Good production design creating an acceptable scenario with luminous outdoors rocky landscapes under a shinning sun and fine sets by Jose Luis Galicia  habitual production designer of a lot of Westerns shot in Spain . Middling cinematography by Miguel Mila  being necessary a right remastering and filmed on location in Manzanares Del Real  Colmenar  La Pedriza Madrid and interior in Elios Studios  Rome . Nice musical score by Bruno Nicolai  usual collaborator to Ennio Morricone  furthermore a catching and emotive leitmotif .Arizona Lets Fly and Kill Everybody or Arizona Colt Returns was regularly directed by the prolific filmmaker Sergio Martino who usually uses pseudonym as Martin Dolman . Talented and versatile writerdirector Sergio Martino has made a vast array of often solid and entertaining films in all kind of genres as horror Giallo  comedy Western  and science fiction in a career that spans over 40 years . He was especially expert on Western as proved in Mannaja and this Arizona returns and Giallo such as The case of scorpion's tail   Torso the scorpion with two tails  The strange vice of Mrs Ward  Cannibal movie as Mountain of the Cannibal God Italian crime thrillers as Violent Professionals and SciFi as Destroyer  2019 After the Fall of New York . Rating Middling though passable Spaghetti  this is a RavioliChorizo Western in which the camera stalks in moving style throughout a story with decent visual skills . This is a bewildering story  funny in some moment but falls flat  though it will appeal to Spaghetti hardcore fans .".

Being a SpanishItalian coproduction  here appears familiar faces from Chorizo or Paella or Tortilla Western such as Aldo Sambrell  Luis Barboo  Fernando Bilbao and the sympathetic Robert Camardiel as costarring . Good production design creating an acceptable scenario with luminous outdoors rocky landscapes under a shinning sun and fine sets by Jose Luis Galicia  habitual production designer of a lot of Westerns shot in Spain . Middling cinematography by Miguel Mila  being necessary a right remastering and filmed on location in Manzanares Del Real  Colmenar  La Pedriza Madrid and interior in Elios Studios  Rome . Nice musical score by Bruno Nicolai  usual collaborator to Ennio Morricone  furthermore a catching and emotive leitmotif .Arizona Lets Fly and Kill Everybody or Arizona Colt Returns was regularly directed by the prolific filmmaker Sergio Martino who usually uses pseudonym as Martin Dolman . Talented and versatile writerdirector Sergio Martino has made a vast array of often solid and entertaining films in all kind of genres as horror Giallo  comedy Western  and science fiction in a career that spans over 40 years . He was especially expert on Western as proved in Mannaja and this Arizona returns and Giallo such as The case of scorpion's tail   Torso the scorpion with two tails  The strange vice of Mrs Ward  Cannibal movie as Mountain of the Cannibal God Italian crime thrillers as Violent Professionals and SciFi as Destroyer  2019 After the Fall of New York . Rating Middling though passable Spaghetti  this is a RavioliChorizo Western in which the camera stalks in moving style throughout a story with decent visual skills . This is a bewildering story  funny in some moment but falls flat  though it will appeal to Spaghetti hardcore fans .";

For spaghettiwestern standards the violence is normal and not too brutal. So it isn't an ugly dirty one either. What is the best of this western? Maybe Anthony Steffen or Anthonio De Teff as Arizona but I liked his sidekick DoubleWhiskey too. There are some scenes where these 2 characters are really funny together. I liked to watch the beautiful and good actress Rosalba Neri. Some more scenes with her would be helpful for this movie. Sometimes it seems that Rosalba was a little bit underchallenged in her role. Most of the other actors you have already seen in Movies made in Italy from that period. The sounds of composer Bruno Nicolai are great in this movie. Maybe the music is too good for a cheap movie like that.Overall I must say that Arizona Colt Returns was entertaining. And I think this is the most important thing about a movie like this. I had the luck to watch this movie with a not so poor quality. When you are someone who likes Western from Europe even the worst then you will enjoy Arizona Colt Returns.".

Strangely his wife isn't too happy with this set up and is quite happy to continually torture Milian. Milian therefore still goes ahead with the business deal still bangs his mistress and has now started to arrange to have Power of Attorney over his wife by trying to forge her signature. Things don't look too good until several 'chance' meeting with a certain Count Matteo move things in a more positive direction.You see Count Matteo is yet another one of these bored turned on rich types with barely any soul who have explored most of life's extremes and are pushing for more top sensations. He says to Milian he says if I kill your annoying wife whom I have never met then you can kill my abusive brother who abuses me and is a moron. Milian's all like 'Err...that's...yeah..'Milian ain't interested in that and wants to bump his wife for the cash but then it soon becomes apparent that Matteo was being serious the biggest clue being his wife getting murdered. Now the police are leaning on Milian as his many faults are revealed and he still has to hold up his side of the bargain for Matteo who has various methods in place to make sure that happens. Although a very slow moving eventless giallo with no blood and only some opening credits boobs this film is still worth a watch as it must be the only film that totally displays the full spectrum of Tomas Milian's considerable acting chops. He starts off like a snidey moron but then the look on his face when Matteo describes his murderous idea is priceless. Plus we also get his descent into desperation as it becomes apparent to him and the audience that things have not been weighed in his favour. Still not the most eventful film but full of atmosphere and as it is mostly set in Venice everything is very good to look at. Probably worthwhile to Milian fans and that.".

The scenes in offseason Venice where Milian meets the Count and his mysterious lady friend are quite unusual and atmospheric. Unfortunately the odd lady friend vanishes from the scene leaving Milian and the fop to lead the picture. You will sort of know roughly where the story is going if you are even vaguely familiar with the Hitchcock original. But it's not predictability that's the problem here it's more the fact that there is a serious lack of suspense and thrills. The film drags for the most part and the dynamic between the two central characters isn't as interesting as it should be. I couldn't really wholeheartedly recommend this one. When you consider the other Italian thrillers on offer in the 70's this one pales quite a bit by comparison.".

There are for example a few moments from the deleted scenes part of the DVD bonus which 'flesh out' the count's character which I think the film needed.My guess is that too many 'cooks' writers producers directors editors were involved and there never was a satisfactorily resolved 'original version'.It's interesting how the film veers away from Highsmith's novel and Hitchcock's film. Count Matteo Pierre Clementi like his counterparts in Highsmith and Hitchcock comes from a privileged background free from the demands of having to earn his living and a place in society. The unhappy husband Stefano was a two cent designer his wife lifted from total social insignificancenow that he's rich thanks to her he thinks like a businessman his wife prefers him as he was and doesn't love him any more she says.The counts confides that his brother harasses him to the point of making his life unlivable. We never encounter this 'brother' in the film nor any one else from the count's family not even a photo. of any family. He indicates to Stefano how by 'trading murders' they can eliminate each man's obstacle to fulfillment.The count tells Stefano that Stefano is his real brother now. He tracks Stefano's every move  seems to know him inside out and plots with the inescapable logic of a mastermind the events that culminate in the two projected murders. Here again he differs from the HighmithHitchcock character. Another thing Stefano's wife can't bear about her husband now he's so irresolute everything ends up some mishmash compromise like his pretending? he was going to put a portion of the money he stole from his wife into her account. At one point the count takes Stefano by the scruff of the neck makes him look at himself in the glass and says 'What I'm proposing is what you really want to do.' As if the count is the ideal Stefanno the real one hasn't the courage to be. Guess who's the 'brother' Stefano kills? The film misses becoming truly haunting and profound because some of the filmmaking team didn't understand the potential of their material and treated it like a run of the mill Giallo. The acting and dialogue are above average in Italian! the English version sounds like a translation. Given a more sensitive restoration this could be a minor masterpiece with themes of universal resonance e.g. don't we all know a 'Stefano' the 'wanabe' who only exasperates us with his pathetic half measures?. All the same this DVD version should interest those of us who like psychological thrillers.".

	schema:headline " Interesting thriller but a bit too high brow for it's own good";
	schema:reviewBody "The influence for this film is clear it's basically an Italian twist on the Hitchcock classic Strangers on a Train. Being a big fan of that film I was of course intrigued to see how this was going to turn out. I wont say I was too disappointed overall but it's nowhere near as good as the original and certainly could have been a lot better. The main problem with it is that director Maurizio Lucidi has aimed too high it's clear he wanted this to be a high quality thriller rather than a slice of Italian exploitation  and personally I'd rather it have been the latter. The basics of the plot will be familiar to most fans of thrillers and in this film we focus on Stefano Argenti an advertising executive who is at odds with his wife over the sale of a joint business. He wants rid of it so he can live a life of luxury with his mistress but his wife wont agree the sale. Stefano meets Count Mateo Tiepolo who it transpires is at odds with his violent brother. Mateo suggests a plan in which each man murder the other's vice though Stefano is reluctant. But then Mateo kills Stefano's wife and demands that the favour is returned.The lead roles are taken by Tomas Milian and Pierre Clmenti and both perform well and share an intriguing almost homoerotic bond on screen together. The plot itself is rather slowly paced and it has to be said there's not a great deal of excitement I was never on the edge of my seat waiting to see what's going to happen and that's unfortunate since the film is supposed to be a thriller. It's all very well orchestrated however and the film has themes that go deeper than merely what we're seeing on screen. Director Maurizio Lucidi obviously wanted to keep the film clean and therefore we don't see any murders actually happen which is a bit of a disappointment. The locations are all very beautiful and well shot and this brilliantly offsets the dark themes of the film. The soundtrack is rather interesting also and not merely the norm for Giallo. The film deviates from Hitchcock's original with the ending which features a clever twist though I have to say I prefer how the original turned out. Overall I would definitely say that this film is worth a look however I'd have preferred some more of the classic Giallo style.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the many reasons I have been drawn to the giallo genre over the last few years is the attention paid to locations. Beautiful jawdropping scenery occasionally succeeds in distracting the viewer from a meandering plot or plot details that sometimes make little sense. I also love that these productions are very 'of their time'. That is to say at their peak in the early 70s the look and atmosphere is defined by the style of those years.This is very much the case with 'The Designated Victim' which Shameless DVDs have brought us from the brink of the abyss of 'lost films'. Carefully stitching the project back together we should be grateful that this exists at all. It has the exotic looks of the early 70s 'turned up to 11'. The Venice locations are incredible draped in chilly mist which greatly enhances the enigmatic presence of fey Count Matteo Tiepolo Pierre Clmenti dubbed by an actor who seems to be channelling Michael Gough all long curls and flowing eccentric clothes. His relationship with weary playboy Stefano Augenti Tomas Milian also featured in the following year's 'Don't Torture a Duckling' he also sings the end theme more than verges on the homoerotic and adds an extra element to the murderous deal they strike they agree to kill each other's relatives. The two men are featured on most of the publicity rather than the image of a nubile young woman as in other films of this type.The exquisite music of Luis Enriquez Bacalov greatly compliments this stylish thriller. Shameless really have done an exceptional job restoring director Maurizio Lucidi's magnificent looking project. A reworking of Alfred Hitchcock's 'Strangers on a Train' this is certainly leisurely paced and could contain more in the way of suspense  and yet to me it looks so good and the relationship between the leads is so weird anything else is secondary.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Italian film industry loves Alfred Hitchcock that's a commonly known fact and many directors for example Dario Argento borrowed style as well as substance elements from Hitch' rich oeuvre to use in their own gialli. The four ! scriptwriters of The Designated Victim even take their admiration for the Master of Suspense even further as this is basically a gialloremake of one of Hitchcock's most iconic thrillers  Strangers on a Train. Tomas Milian in between his Spaghetti Western and Poliziotesschi period depicts successful advertisement executive Stefano Augenti who wishes to sell all his shares for 220 million Lire and emigrate to Venezuela with his hot mistress Fabienne. Minor problem however is that Stefano's shares belong to his wife Luisa and she refuses to sell or even grant Stefano a divorce. Whilst in Venice with Fabienne Stefano meets the eccentric young Count Tiepolo and he comes with a peculiar preposition. He offers to kill Stefano's wife if Stefano agrees to kill his brother. Although Stefano never really agrees to the plan Tiepolo already goes ahead with his part and kills the wife anyway. Stefano now depends of the count for his alibi and the latter increases the pressure to complete his part of the bargain. The Designated Victim is very much a hit  miss thriller. Tomas Milian and Pierre Clmenti are stellar the filming locations  most notably Venice  are breathtaking and the plot knows a few remarkably tense moments but the pacing is overall too slow and the lack of action is rather frustrating. Director Maurizio Lucidi doesn't have the same flair and craftmanship of some of his contemporary colleagues resulting in an often dull film to look at. The endtwist is predictable and in my humble opinion doesn't solve anything for Stefano and only pushes him deeper into misery.".

	schema:reviewBody "Strangers on a Train is given the giallo treatment in The Designated Victim which is sadly nowhere near as good as Hitchcock's classic nor is it one of the better Italian murder mysteries to hail from the '70s.Tomas Milian plays successful advertising executive Stefano Augenti who tries unsuccessfully to get his wife Luisa Marisa Bartoli to sell her half of the company which would free up funds for Stefano to leg it to Venezuela with his sexy mistress French model Fabienne Katia Christine. While on a dirty weekend with Fabienne in Venice Stefano encounters the foppish Count Matteo Tiepolo Pierre Clmenti who looks like Russell Brand crossed with Freddie Mercury who comes up with a scheme that would benefit them both Matteo would kill Luisa and in return Stefano would murder Matteo's bully of a brother.

While on a dirty weekend with Fabienne in Venice Stefano encounters the foppish Count Matteo Tiepolo Pierre Clmenti who looks like Russell Brand crossed with Freddie Mercury who comes up with a scheme that would benefit them both Matteo would kill Luisa and in return Stefano would murder Matteo's bully of a brother. Stefano brushes the idea off as morbid chitchat but Matteo goes through with his part of the plan regardless strangling Luisa with a stocking.

	schema:reviewBody "THE DESIGNATED VICTIM is a giallocrime hybrid with an offform Tomas Milian playing before he became attached to the polizia genre. It turns out to be a straight remake of the Hitchcock classic STRANGERS ON A TRAIN albeit with a much less interesting scenario and a rather static backdrop. The direction is strictly pedestrian and fails to build much kind of suspense at all with the end result that this is slowmoving and stilted at times. Milian's dullish character meets a flamboyant Freddie Mercurylookalike count and the two agree on mutual murders but things become complicated when he can't go through with his end of it. A police procedural subplot only serves to slow things down further. On the plus side it's a classy production and the Venice locations are typically picturesque but you're just left wanting a bit more.".

After a very few minutes the viewer will sit on the edge of his seat for a full hour where there is virtually no dialogue.  When this movie was first released 35 years ago I drove 30 miles across town to find and see it.  It was worth the trip.  Years later watching it on TV they omitted so as not offend the viewers' sensibilities what was one of the most effective moments in relieving the tension in an action film I have ever seen  the burp!  The next time it was shown I had to watch and was pleased to see it was back in.  Watch for it and you will know what I mean.  All of the comments by naysayers about racism should be ignored.  If anything it is one of the most antiracist films ever made much credit to Cornel Wilde who made directed and starred in the film with outstanding achievement in all three areas.  Previously known for his role as Fredric Chopin in An Affair to Remember this was also one of my favourite films.  As the prey Wilde shows the battle not only of man against man but man against nature in the fight for survival and in a triumphal moment at the end he salutes his pursuers who in mutual respect return his salute.  What more egalitarian gesture can one ask for in a pursuit and a fight to the death?  Recommended for all adults but for those with a weak stomach.".

	schema:headline " I dont think this is a racist film";
	schema:reviewBody "A lot of comments hear say that this movie is obviously racist.I think this an nervous knee jerk reaction. It definitely dose not put a phony PC spin on colonial Africa but that doesn't mean it is racist.Certainly the racism of the safari leader who refuses to respect the tribe with a gift is portrayed and is most likely accurate. It should be noted that the rest of the movie is a direct result of this racist white mans ignorant arrogance and that the hero knows better and tries to warn him. It is improbable that one man out of his element could over come his pursuers who must know the terrain better and have more experience hunting and fighting with spears however I think this is not an attempt to portray the white man as superior but a convention of action movies heroes can always dodge bullets.  The idea that this movie portrays all Africans as savages is based on the assumption that the pursuers are representative of ALL Africans which is a bit racist in itself. They are a particular tribe. Africa is a big continent full of many different nations and tribes. There are other Africans present including those in the safari party who are not shown to be savages. There are also two other tribes depicted towards the end. One is the village that the man comes upon. These people wear dyed clothing and seem to have a more advanced structured and less violently primal society. The white mans life is saved by a child from this more peaceful tribe. They are attacked by another tribe obviously working for colonial slave traders who wear more modern clothing and have guns. This really happened. Some Africans at war with other Africans would sell their conquered foes to the white slave traders.When will people learn that portraying racism in all its ugliness and complexity is not equivalent to being a racist.  The man who plays the hero was also the director. he is a white man and the story is told from his perspective but not exclusively. Part of the films context is that of cultures colliding both European with African and African with African. Another important point to this movie is that this is an educated civilized man who is literally stripped of all the trappings of his civilization and thrust into the primal and universal struggle of shear survival. Im no expert on Africa but from what little I have read about its history the movie while a simple tale in itself did not seem to over simplify its portrayal of Africa. I suspect that quite far from being racist the makers of this film probably had a respect for African culture. I could be wrong but I doubt it.Over all I found it to be well acted.  Even though the film makers did not have had a big Hollywood budget and may have used some stock wild life footage it seemed to blend seamlessly. As far as the chicken chasing scene I liked how comic it was. In reality a starving man desperately chasing a chicken around with a spear would probably look pitifully comical and I believe the irony is intentional. I recommend this film.  I found it to be very original but if forced to describe it I would say its a mixture of Nicolas Roeg's Walkabout though not as pretentious and Conrad's Heart of Darkness.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here is a magnificent example of a film that can generate an atmosphere of survivalist instinct so well that water is the only thing that comes to mind after viewing. Set aside its riveting plot and direction by a newtofilmmaking olympic champion Cornel Wilde and what you have is one of the most atmospheric films of all time! You really feel like your there on a survivalist run from Tribal African Predators with only 10 seconds in front of the nearest warrior. There is that consistent feel of stamina and nostalgia but there is always that sense of comfort in knowing that the main actor is the Olympic champion runner also director and that he has a great chance to make it out alive. What surprises me most is that this film has hardly dated and the themes the film explores regarding humanity and life still apply today. An adventure film of lightning power that may teach us a lesson or two  different country different customs.......no need to be prejudiced A quote from 'The Man Who Would Be King'  another stellar Adventure escapist masterpiece.Dialogue in the film comes close to NIL but like in a Clint Eastwood movie you read the emotions through the eyes and the facial expressions . The plot is very simple and straight forward and you come to understand the African Tribe  it is a film where no side is right but survival is a human instinct!What I found most striking about this film was the cinematography and the stock footage. It gave a sense of natural beauty yet a sense of emptiness and isolation  and as we are going on our journey with our protagonist we feel inevitably alone that nobody can help you but yourself and this is why this movie stands high above many. It projects difficulty of the situation to perfection in showing the heat of the region the thirst and hunger that arises from scarce vegetation and wildlife and you cannot help but be drawn into our protagonists struggle for hydration.No orchestral score was provided in the background either  our complete sense of civilization has been taken from us and we are treated to the unfamiliar tribal drum rhythm. Towards the end you feel frantic for the protagonist and it is only when he starts singing the English song that you feel the sanity is still there in such a harsh circumstance.It is impossible to take your eyes off the screen throughout the running time of this masterly crafted gem of a film. It is when you see the British headquarters at the end that you sigh with relieve after such a long excruciating journey.The actors did a marvelous job. Especially the leader of the tribal warriors. There was a real sense of humanity that came upon him when he waved off our protagonist at the end of the film and there was a real understanding on his face  a great performance!This film is rare and out of print. One of those great films that deserves so much more recognition than it received upon its release  especially when compared to the boxoffice drawing Hollywood masterpieces of mediocrity that dominate our cinema screens today. I can only say that this is a must have in a film collection. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys adventure thrillers because this is one of the best and those who have seen it know what I am talking about. For a rarely equaled atmospheric masterwork such as The Naked Prey go no further. A forgotten 'classic' in its genre.".

There was a real sense of humanity that came upon him when he waved off our protagonist at the end of the film and there was a real understanding on his face  a great performance!This film is rare and out of print. One of those great films that deserves so much more recognition than it received upon its release  especially when compared to the boxoffice drawing Hollywood masterpieces of mediocrity that dominate our cinema screens today. I can only say that this is a must have in a film collection. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys adventure thrillers because this is one of the best and those who have seen it know what I am talking about. For a rarely equaled atmospheric masterwork such as The Naked Prey go no further. A forgotten 'classic' in its genre.";

This is a moving manhunt of indescribable terror and screaming suspense . It is remarkable as well as competently made and it packs strong fights  spectacular sequences and remarkable brutal images  creating a large impact on Italian subgenre  Mondo Cannibale. Good acting by Cornel Wilde as safari leader pursued by a large bunch of native warriors determined to finish him off . Cornel Wilde was careful to try to avoid harm to animals appearing in the film where possible. In the scene where the python and the monitor lizard battle it became clear that the python was winning and the monitor was in danger  Wilde personally intervened to save the monitor lizard the lizard bit him on the leg refusing to let go. We are seeing several African animals though some of them turn out to be taken from prior stockshots .

Colorful as well as evocative cinematography in Panavisin by R. Thomson . Appropriate musical score by means of drummers and African sounds . This harrowing motion picture was compellingly starred  written  produced and directed by Cornel Wilde . Wilde does a competent job both as actor and filmmaker . I's amazingly well done movie  being Cornel Wilde's best film . He is especially credited as a good actor but also known for directing some acceptable flicks . His later films were of varying quality and he ended his career in nearcameos in minor adventure films .

	schema:reviewBody "If you want a basic movie review you may want to skip this entry. However if you are a fan of the late Joseph Campbell or enjoy attempts at mythological interpretation you might find this interesting. On the surface Naked Prey may appear as just a neat TourdeForce action film but having viewed it numerous times over the past 15 years I have found the film to reveal a much deeper critical significance then most works of the celluloid genre can offer. Cornell Wilde's survival trek across the wilds of South Africa portrays an immensely symbolic experience that mirrors the primal journey of every human mind and spirit. Filled with archetypes instead of personalities Notice there are no names in the movie only Man and the Pursuers as if they are only ideas of something Naked Prey is a showcase for the figurative battle that every human fights in their subconscious mind.The sparse dialogue of the film underlines the fact that this is a movie of the mind The film's chase scenes appear as a model of the universaleternal cycle of life. In the film's opening Cornel Wilde sets off from the fortress like an infant from the womb and influenced by choice and chance goes through a figurative cycle of birthlifedeathrebirth. A few of the movie's props play important roles The harsh flora and fauna of the savanna act as the world of obstacles that we all must struggle and compete within. Stripped down literally in this film! The naked man must become a part of his environment in order to conqueror it. Just as Wilde becomes both hunter and hunted in many scenes of the film. Other major archetypes include the Masai tribesmen who are not so much the villians of the story as they might represent the elements of primal fear. They are part of the danger and their pursuit to catch the man is as relentless as the uncertantiestrials we must face as human beings. The Man is not the target of their hunt solely by chance. Though demonstrating some nobleness of character he has paritally put himself in this position by the reluctant choice of company he kept with the Safari.The Man must therefore confront the unknown possibilites of the wild and be willing to die As he appears to briefly when dragged from the river before he can get back home. His goal of settling down on his farm must be putoff until he completes this rite of passage. Ultimately as the late mythological expert Joseph Campbell would say we come to the task of the mythical hero to accomplish that unknown goal that brings spiritual fulfillment. Obviously this is the Man who is able well almost able...to return to the seminal place from which he came. With the help of some outside support The little girl the sentry guards at the fort Man becomes a survivor and fulfills his quest. He is able to look back at his struggle As we sometimes reflect on our past with an almost wry smile. Though not very moviebuff would care much to turn entertainment into philosophical study it is to me as if these subconscious archetypes in Naked Prey are unlocked gradually through the viewer's very natural relationship to them. I don't necessarily believe that Wilde read as deeply into the story as I have but then again that's the subconscious mind at work. Naked Prey is a very entertaining action picture. Like Boorman's Deliverance it just also happens to an inconspicuous mythical masterpiece.".

The action begins whereby a hunting expedition lead by Wilde comes across a group of tribal huntsmen.

	schema:reviewBody "Way back in 1932around the same time that Director Ernest B. Schoedsack was involved in production of the original classic King Konghe also made another classic film entitled The Most Dangerous Game MDG. Based on a famous story by Richard Connell MDG tells the tale of a megalomaniac hunter who lives on a remote island. Ships would regularly end up wrecked on reefs near the island. Their passengers and crew would be rescued by our hunterenjoy his sophisticated hospitality for a timeand then end up as prey as our crazy hunter indulges in his very perverse sport. MDG starred a very young Joel McCrea and two members of the original King Kong castFay I never met a scream that I didn't like! Wray and Robert Armstrong. At 63 minutes in length MDG is the model of an exciting and compact thriller film.Since the basic idea of someone being forced into the totally unexpected role of an innocent victim hunted down with the intention of becoming another's trophy kill is pretty powerfulit has been remade into numerous films Game of Death Run for the Sun etc..The plot device is essentially the same one that Cornel Wilde employed in his variation on MDG entitled The Naked Prey released some 34 years after the original film. Wilde makes his movie interesting by having a big game hunter becoming the hunted and changing the megalomaniac hunter into a band of African tribesmen determined to chase down the Wilde character and do him in.Wilde also indulges his film with numerous symbolic devices and subplot linesbut remains true to the basic premise of MDG. Survival is a battle of wits between the hunters and the hunted and only the most resourceful of preys can make it alive to the end of the tale.Viewers who like The Naked Prey ought to seek out MDG to recognize yet again the practice often used by Warner Brothers in the 1930s if the original film tells a good story it is worth remakingand remakingand remaking......".

Yeah NO BLADE OF GRASS is shockingly thought provoking but thats entirely down to the John Christopher source novel rather than the adapted screenplay or Cornel Wildes sledge hammer direction telling us what a terrible thing  yawn  pollution isThe premise of THE NAKED PREY is white man getting chased through African bush by black natives but the movie never becomes racist or reactionary and even more refreshingly is devoid of any patronising liberal right on attitudes . Wildes hero called simply  The Man  is an innocent victim who happened to have the misfortune of being a safari guide to a bunch of philistines  but hey everyone has to make a living . The natives who while not exactly being painted in the most sympathetic light do have a motive for their amoral stance  One of moral relativism . It should also be pointed out that the natives do weep tears for their dead kinsmen and are capable of respect too . The screenplay never talks down to its audience by having tribal chiefs suddenly speak pidgen English when it suits the narrative nor are we shown subtitles but its easy to tell whats going on . The fact that Clint Johnstons and Don Peters screenplay was Oscar nominated says a lot about its quality A good film mainly down to the fact that it treats the audience with some respect and doesnt degenerate into a slightly obvious MCGUYVER type plot . Having said that I did mention earlier that its not all that well directed with obvious stock footage used . Its also obvious in the early chase scenes that Wildes character is wearing flesh coloured briefs when hes supposed to be naked and I wished I could have seen a few more of those cruel and inventive executions which probably says a lot about me . Maybe some day we will see a remake set in the Brazilian rain forest with a guide escorting a bunch of environmentalist do gooders stomping through the jungle telling indiginous tribes how to live their lives and being confused as to why the natives want to impale them on a pole . Everything is down to respect".

I believe this movie brought a new meaning to the expression Survival of the fittest.  You might agree once you see it too!  A very extraordinary movie.    So if you like history or movies having to do with the jungle then this one is perfect for fans of the history or jungle genre!  I give The Naked Prey 4 12 out of 5 stars!  A definate mustsee!".

A perfect example of what I mean in a popular TV series is American Idol which drives me nuts with the constant thumping repetition's two notes that go on over and over and over throughout the whole program as long as noone is singing. One last complaint with most of todays concert DVD's is the constant 50 different camera angles that bounce back and forth and don't let you focus in on the performer for more than a second or two.

Well no one ever gave them the real Africa quite like Cornel Wilde did in The Naked Prey.That it was shot in Africa is a given in fact it was shot in the former Union of South Africa Bechuanaland and Southern Rhodesia two out of the three final gasps of white colonialism on the continent. And the cinematography is spectacular in color and quite graphic about the beauty and brutality of the jungle.The story as it is is set in Africa of the 1850s before the European had penetrated much beyond the coastal areas. Wilde plays a safari guide and tries to talk a thickheaded and obstinate man heading the safari to part with a few trade goods. What this nitwit does is insult the chief. Such an act of lese majeste is not tolerated and the tribe swoops down on the safari with a vengeance and kills all of them in some truly terrifying ways. Wilde however is given a break a small head start as he's sent out buck naked into the jungle and pursued by the tribe.Wilde who has the experience in the jungle proves to be quite capable and ingenious at foiling the warriors after him. In many ways The Naked Prey is the ultimate survival film. For those curious Wilde does not stay naked he finds some animal skins to protect the privates.With minimal and I mean minimal dialog Wilde turns in a great performance in many ways similar to Spencer Tracy in The Old Man And The Sea but with a lot more action.The Naked Prey is one of the best African location films ever done and it's a timeless classic.".

The opening sequences in the African natives' village is horrific. It displays man's barbarous nature at its ugliest. A simple film but one that works!

It is the act of execution which is bestial not the method. Thankfully most European countries have now come to this realisation and amended their laws accordingly. The rest of the world I am confident will follow when they are ready.Such a shame this film is not more widely known and consequently viewed.".

I think the filmmakers probably just decided it was just too good a title to pass up. Nonetheless those looking for a horror tale containing bona fide Celtic mythology should probably look elsewhere. There is horror to be had here however and the film still does more or less what it promises.Cry Of The Banshee is set during the height of Middle Ages England where rampant ignorance and superstition meant anyone could be condemned and burned for alleged witchcraft and anyone you didn't like could be targeted. However this being in the horror genre rather than an Arthur Miller play the local inhabitants' fears are not entirely unjustified. Nonetheless the greater threat is the Witchfinder General played by Price and his family who abuse their authority and keep the entire local population in their grip. 'Witches' are regularly found and dispatched in the name of God. The witchfinder gets more than he bargained for however when he annoys a real witch who decides to take revenge.Vincent Price is an actor you can rely on to take an average film up a notch and he does so here. His presence his voice his face  he doesn't even have to try very hard. Not that the story is especially bad. It's fairly basic but entertaining enough. Even so the pantomime acting and thinlydrawn characterisation made it hard to take everything seriously. A melodramatic situation shouldn't mean overthetop theatricality but that's what the script and the direction unfortunately settle for.Fortunately the horror elements of the film are not so misplaced. Suspense is built up the 'banshee' of the title is wisely heard rather than seen until the climax and the end itself is very satisfying. The mood is bleak the lighting is low and the score helps the action along without ever being out of place. Like many Hammer Horrors there's a lot of nudity. just in case everything else isn't enough to draw you in.Overall Cry Of The Banshee is an enjoyable example of classic horror that fans of the genre should enjoy. It's not brilliant but it has its moments and one of the genre's star performers to breathe life into it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd seen two films from director Gordon Hessler prior to seeing this one and they're both wildly different. One was the excellent Gothic horror The Oblong Box while the other was the uneven and mostly terrible waste of a great of a cast Scream and Scream Again. This film falls somewhere in the middle in terms of quality. Cry of the Banshee actually reminded me a lot more of the classic film Witchfinder General than either of Hessler's previous efforts although it is nowhere near as good as that one. The plot features themes of witchcraft and witch hunts as we focus on the evil Lord Edward Whitman slaughterer of peasants and a man with an ongoing war against a coven of local witches. He opts to murder a number of them in front of leader a witch named Oona. However this turns out to be a poor decision as Oona uses her magic powers to call up a magical being known as a 'Banshee' whom she uses  along with some members of Lord Whitman's own family  to bring a curse upon his entire household.Obviously my main reason for seeing this film was because of the fact that it features a starring performance from the great Vincent Price. This is not Vincent Price's greatest performance but he still completely owns the film in every sequence that he's in and he's in most of them. The character he plays in Cry of the Banshee isn't the most rounded character he's ever played and therefore it isn't the most interesting  but hey! It's still Vincent Price. The way that the plot plays out is mostly good enough to hold the audience's interest there isn't a great deal of suspense in the film but director Gordon Hessler does a good job of creating the right atmosphere and setting up a suitable 'feel' for the film. The banshee isn't what you'd usually think of when that word springs to mind which gives the film an element of memorability. The ending is decent enough although it is rather predictable and overall it has to be said that Cry of the Banshee is a more than passable. Sure it's not brilliant  but Vincent Price fans are likely to enjoy it and it gets a recommendation from me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lord Edward WhitmanVincent Price is a wicked magistrate who why while not believing in Witchcraft delights in accusing peasants of the crime. The punishments he dishes out are not always within the law though. Working On a tip off his men kill many within a coven of witches the witches leader Oona swears revenge and pleads with Satan to send her an Avenger who will smite him and his family. Such an avenger is the mild mannered stable hand RoderickPatrick Mower who was found as a child in the woods and brought up by the Whitmans around his neck he wears a strange and ancient medallion of unknown origin.Gordon Hessler has a mixed filmography in Horror this on the face of it is a production designed to take advantage of Michael Reeves's Witchfinder General as wonderfully hammy Vincent Price and the beautiful Hilary Heath both return as does DP John Coquillon who adds oodles of atmosphere and energy with his ever moving camera which captures the location work beautifully. Hessler learnt his trade with Hitchcock and to some extent it shows in this film he knows when and where to provide the scares. The film itself was much rewritten and Hessler found himself getting further away from the theme of the title which had already been sold as a Banshee film before filming began but he was reigned back in by the producers the meddling doesn't quite ruin the film but it does have a lot going on plotwise as a result.

	onyx:emotionText "Lord Edward WhitmanVincent Price is a wicked magistrate who why while not believing in Witchcraft delights in accusing peasants of the crime. The punishments he dishes out are not always within the law though. Working On a tip off his men kill many within a coven of witches the witches leader Oona swears revenge and pleads with Satan to send her an Avenger who will smite him and his family. Such an avenger is the mild mannered stable hand RoderickPatrick Mower who was found as a child in the woods and brought up by the Whitmans around his neck he wears a strange and ancient medallion of unknown origin.Gordon Hessler has a mixed filmography in Horror this on the face of it is a production designed to take advantage of Michael Reeves's Witchfinder General as wonderfully hammy Vincent Price and the beautiful Hilary Heath both return as does DP John Coquillon who adds oodles of atmosphere and energy with his ever moving camera which captures the location work beautifully. Hessler learnt his trade with Hitchcock and to some extent it shows in this film he knows when and where to provide the scares. The film itself was much rewritten and Hessler found himself getting further away from the theme of the title which had already been sold as a Banshee film before filming began but he was reigned back in by the producers the meddling doesn't quite ruin the film but it does have a lot going on plotwise as a result. The witches coven send a Sidhe an ancient derivative of the banshee in the form of Patrick Mower his make up none to convincing to kill one by one members of the Whitman family not all of which are bad some are very decent people this effective ploy is also used with the witches making it hard to take sides or see who the really bad guys are.

It stars Vincent Price easily the biggest name in horror in the '60s. Despite the title there's no banshees in this movie. It's about an evil magistrate Price who abuses and kills people in his village in the name of witch hunting. Similar at this point to another better Price vehicle from around this time called The Conqueror Worm. But the similarities end there as the main plot is about some witches summoning a demon or something to seek revenge on Price and his wicked children. No banshees to be found. Lots of sexual stuff though and not all of it consensual. There's even a song about rape in the movie. So...yeah...more banshees and less rape please. This is an ugly cheap and unpleasant exploitation movie. It's not fun enough to be entertaining and as for horror it couldn't scare a five yearold. One interesting little bit of trivia is that Terry Gilliam did the opening credits. They're done in that same style Monty Python was famous for.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gordon Hessler's Cry Of The Banshee of 1970 is certainly one of the weaker films with the great Vincent Price but it is still a pretty good horror flick and certainly way underrated. I must add however that Vincent Price is my favorite actor of alltime and my personal opinion is that you can never go wrong with a film with Price in the lead.Price stars as Lord William Whitman a sadistic despot in Elizabethean England who wants to terminate superstitious beliefs by brutally massacring followers of the 'old religion' a bizarre hippiestyle witch cult lead by an old woman called Oona Elisabeth Bergner. Lord Whitman who lives in his castle with his kindhearted daughter Maureen Hillary Heath his sadistic son Harry Carl Rigg his wife Lady Patricia Essy Persson and Roderick a young man whom the despotic lord let live with his family since childhood shows no mercy when it comes to the persecution of the pagans living in the woods and brutal oppression is the everyday situation in his town where people are tortured and killed for the simple suspicion of being followers of Oona's cult.Some parts of the movie remind a lot of Michael Reeves' masterpiece Witchfinder General of 1968 which also had Price in the lead and which is of course incomparably better than Cry Of The Banshee. Besides Price the movie also stars Hillary Heath who also played the female lead in Witchfinder General. Price is excellent as always and Heath also delivers a good performance as his daughter. The rest of the acting differs some performances are better some worse but they're certainly not terrible. The movie certainly has a few pretty cheesy moments but it has at least as many creepy ones. Although the violence in this movie is not comparable to the violence in Witchfinder General the movie has some pretty brutal moments and some nudity which gives the film a nice Exploitation feeling.Cry Of The Banshee is certainly not one of the masterpieces with Vincent Price but it is certainly not as bad as many seem to regard it. I personally found it very enjoyable it definitely has some creepy moments and I warmly recommend it to fans of Horror flicks and Vincent Price. 710".

One can hardly fail to notice that it's not entirely unsympathetic to the witches and portrays the establishment as a crass and foul bunch of people. Whitman and his entourage will amuse themselves by manipulating and embarrassing their victims in their opulent castle. The pacing is mostly effective and the banshee of the title is appreciably kept as mysterious as possible it's never very well lit. It also builds up a decent body count and dishes out some pretty gory violence.Price delivers a solid performance refraining from becoming overly theatrical for the most part. Essy Persson is very good playing the unfortunate illfated wife. Hilary Heath Carl Rigg Stephan Chase Marshall Jones Andrew McCulloch Michael Elphick and Patrick Mower comprise an excellent supporting cast. Bergner is good if also unmemorable as the antagonist and Hugh Griffith makes the most of his regrettably minor role as a grave digger and corpse robber.Cry of the Banshee is not a great horror film but it is good fun.

	schema:headline " A Midgrade Vincent Price Film";
	schema:reviewBody "The film is set in Elizabethan England and revolves around a wicked magistrate who tries to kill all the members of a coven of witches. This makes the leader of the coven Oona sworn enemies of the lord and his family. To get revenge Oona calls up a magical servant a sidhe to destroy the lord's family. The titular cry of the banshee is the signal that someone will die.The script went through a few revisions. Tim Kelly's script had witches who were all old women and set the story in the 1700s. Christopher Wicking moved the time to the 1500s more accurate and made the witches varying ages and genders. Wicking also changed the wife to a stepmother rather than a mother of the Whitmans which gives her a bit of distance to see the actions of her cruel new family. Steve Haberman suggests that Wicking's rewrite of Kelly was in part inspired by the Manson murders. The witches initially were more peaceful but under Wicking actually invoke Satan by name. This takes the natureworshiping cult to a whole new level... from nature to the devil himself. Director Gordon Hessler said he and Wicking wanted to get one more draft of the script in but AIP was rushing the production. One wonders what might have happened with just a bit more spit and polish.The first thing you will notice when watching this film is that it looks like the opening is from a Monty Python movie. And there is a good reason you think that it was in fact animated by Terry Gilliam the American member of Monty Python and their animator. Unfortunately this may be the highlight of the movie.Vincent Price carries this film as there are no other big name actors to speak of. Unless you count AIP regular and Academy Award winner Hugh Griffith who plays the drunken grave robber Mickey. Mike Mayo says Price is not at his best but still fine and that is a fair assessment. But even at just fine Price is more enjoyable to watch than most others of his generation.The remainder of the cast as I said is hardly notable. There is Stephen Rea who was later nominated for an Oscar appearing in his first film role he did a couple of television appearances before that. And there is a man named Guy Pierce in a very small role but it is not the guy you think it is. A shame really. Hilary Dwyer had previously been in both Witchfinder General 1968 and The Oblong Box 1969 alongside Vincent Price but is not known outside of the AIP fan niche.For some reason there is a happy song sung by a man with a lute about a maiden who is raped by a huntsman and then gets her revenge on him by castrating him. I do not know how to feel about this being sung as an uplifting ballad. Haberman says that this was a song that truly dated to the correct period so I have to give them credit for that. And it does coincide with a maiden getting attacked by thuggish men... but no castration.Overall the film is okay or good but not the best. Vincent Price has better films where he plays a witch hunter including Conqueror Worm and better films in general. Still worth seeing but do not put it at the top of your list. And do not try to find the banshee in this film because one does not exist. Sorry.Scream Factory as always has released the definitive version of this film on their Vincent Price box set. They give us both the AIP and unrated versions. So if you want to see a little extra violence see a few more topless women and hear the original score before AIP regular Les Baxter was hired to replace it you now have that ability. Unfortunately the director's cut does not substantially improve the movie's slow poorlyconceived plot and even director Gordon Hessler admits this is not some of his best work. Amazingly this was the biggest box office hit of the HesslerWicking team even more than Scream and Scream Again. Could it have been the misuse of the Poe name?Scream also provides a Steve Haberman audio commentary which is very informative. He not only gives biographical information on the various people involved but took the time to read both Kelly's and Wicking's scripts so he knows quite well what went into developing the plot. The disc also has an archive interview with director Hessler which is well worth checking out.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film has one of the most depraved heartless cold centers of any film I have seen in a long time.  None of the characters are likable.  I mean you will not care what happens to anyone.  They are one dimensional characterizations that embody this repulsiveness aforementioned.  Even Vincent Price...typically a wonderful villain who can make you like him despite his evil ways...is nothing more than an atypical English aristocrat who kills for no reason at all.  The film bears a striking resemblance to The Witchfinder General but this and that film although in spirit have much in common are very very different films.  The Witchfinder General was wellwritten had excellent direction and  at least some depth of characterization.  You can tell director Gordon Hessler feels the film lacks depth because of his repeated need to show totally unerotic nudity.  No fewer than six breasts can be seen in the first fifteen minutes of the film. Each pair in a different scene. Each dealt with in a style that only the Marquis de Sade could possibly enjoy.  I guess I am giving this film a negative review.  I was filled with disappointment after seeing it because I had liked The Witchfinder General a great deal and love Vincent Price in almost every vehicle he appears.  Price has a couple moments in the film where he sparkles but they are unfortunately few and far between.  Cry of the Banshee is really much more of a test....a test to see how much of it you can sit through without getting up and turning it off.".

Even Vincent Price...typically a wonderful villain who can make you like him despite his evil ways...is nothing more than an atypical English aristocrat who kills for no reason at all.  The film bears a striking resemblance to The Witchfinder General but this and that film although in spirit have much in common are very very different films.  The Witchfinder General was wellwritten had excellent direction and  at least some depth of characterization.  You can tell director Gordon Hessler feels the film lacks depth because of his repeated need to show totally unerotic nudity.  No fewer than six breasts can be seen in the first fifteen minutes of the film. Each pair in a different scene. Each dealt with in a style that only the Marquis de Sade could possibly enjoy.  I guess I am giving this film a negative review.  I was filled with disappointment after seeing it because I had liked The Witchfinder General a great deal and love Vincent Price in almost every vehicle he appears.  Price has a couple moments in the film where he sparkles but they are unfortunately few and far between.  Cry of the Banshee is really much more of a test....a test to see how much of it you can sit through without getting up and turning it off.";

	schema:reviewBody "This was the third collaboration in barely two years time between director Gordon Hessler scriptwriter Christopher Wicking and horror veteran Vincent Price after the wondrously atmospheric Victorian tale The Oblong Box and the uniquely bizarre Scream and Scream Again. Cry of the Banshee certainly isn't a bad effort I for one found it very much amusing at least but due to its lead actor periodic setting and subject matter it will always and automatically get compared with The Witchfinder General and come out as the weakest one. This isn't even so much of a disgrace as that other Vincent Price classic which was released two years prior is simply a bona fide masterpiece. Perhaps I'm very much biased because I'm a a downright fanatic Vincent Price worshiper and b obsessed with purchasing horror movies that deal with witchery and satanic cults and therefore I don't think Cry of the Banshee deserves all the harsh  negative reviews around here. Honesty does require me to admit that the film contain a couple of severe flaws however most notably the underdevelopment of the main characters and the overly exploitative nature. You can somewhat expect a bit of gratuitous nudity and perversion in a movie about burning witches and corrupt magistrates but the sequences in Cry of the Banshee  especially those during the first fifteen minutes  are quite degrading and misogynist. Price usually didn't star in that type of cinema. At certain moments it's actually noticeable that he doesn't agree with the raw undertones of his dialogs and he tries hard to give his character of sadist magistrate Edward Whitman more depth and background. He's the patriarch of a rich and spoiled family and abuses his magistrate position to randomly accuse innocent women of witchcraft and subsequently submits them to public humiliation and torture. When he orders to slaughter half a coven of actual Satan worshipers the lead witch Oona puts a curse on him and his family. Her vengeance is extracted through an acquaintance of the family the eccentric stranger Roderick who communicates with animals as he mutates into a banshee overnight. There are really a lot of sub plots with terrific potential but sadly they're not elaborated. There are a lot of intrigues within the Whitman family like the oldest son who distanced himself from his father and Edward's third wife feels more affection for Roderick than for her barbaric husband. Personally I also would have preferred a little more info regarding the banshee itself. It's a fascinating creature with nicely grim makeup effects and aggressive personality but we don't know too much about its mythical background. The finale is brilliant though and there are several moments of sheer suspense and grisly medieval ambiance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Title Cry of the Banshee 1970 Director Gordon Hessler Cast Vincent Price Review I'm trying to work my way through Vincent Prices body of work and I've seen some pretty impressive stuff like for example the really excellent Roger Corman directed The Fall of the House of Usher. The hokey and fun The Raven and most recently I had the chance to see Cry of the Banshee. How was it? Well the story is about this England ruler called Edward Whitman. He is a vicious and cold leader making fun of the poor and using his power to accusing pretty girls of being witches just to watch em being tortured to death for their supposed religious practices. Of course he eventually stumbles upon a real coven of witches and when he decides to kill one of them well then their leader a witch called Oona decides to take matters into her own hands and calls upon the spirit of the Banshee to execute revenge upon the house of Whitman.After watching this film the first thing that came to mind was how similar it was in story to Tim Burtons Sleepy Hollow. In Burtons film the spirit of the headless horseman is used by an evil witch who has sold hel soul to Satan to execute revenge and little by little kill off all the members of a rich elite family. On Cry of the Banshee the storyline is exactly the same. Only thing is here they use what they call a Banshee. A creature who howls in the night and lives in the haunted woods just like in Sleepy Hollow. The similarities don't stop their so Ill just leave it up to you to find them. But these similarities make perfect sense to me since Tim Burton is such a Vincent Price fan. It seems to me that this might have been one of Burtons childhood favorites and was an obvious inspiration for Sleepy Hollow.Banshee also deals with religious themes of Christianity vs. witchcraft. Though I must admit that you wont know who to root for in this movie since they were both bad guys in my book. First there's Whitmans religion which is obviously Christian yet he is a cold hearted and soulless bastard who takes pleasure in torturing the poor and oppressed. And then there's the witches and in this movie they are devil worshipers hell bent on revenge. They indulge in calling Satan their lord and master and use voodoo dolls to cause pain and death to their enemies. So you see there's no good guys to root for in this movie everyones a bastard and looking to step on the other. Which if you ask me is the way real life is anyways.The movie is filled to the top with cheesy acting and unrealistic performances. Its all very campy very theatrical and over the top. But I guess most of Prices movies where done in this fashion since I've yet to see one where this wasn't the case so I just go with it and enjoy the sheer cheesiness of it all. But of course Price outshines everyone here because he hams it up yet he takes it so seriously! You can see the guy just relished in taking a role and elevating its cheesiness to higher levels. It was also interesting to see him do a completely evil character with no likable character traits whatsoever. I've seen Price do evil before and even when he is evil he is often times likable...but this is not the case.The Banshee itself the titular creature was left out from most of the film. He is reduced to appearing in shadows and in silhouette until the grand finale when he decides to show his ugly face. The make up is suttle yet effective.On the bonus side this flick has so much gratuitous breast shots that it actually become funny for me to count how many boobs they were going to show! Just when you thought you had your obligatory boob shot...up pops another one. It seemed like every time some dude wanted to ask a girl if she was a witch it was obligatory to open up her blouse with a knife and let the boobs do most of the talking. Heh it kept me amused but also kind of felt overdone and unnecessary.All in all a nice film but I'm sure Vincent Price had better films under his belt. By the way I keep hearing Vincent Prices film The Conqueror Worm aka Witchunter General as a far superior hunt down the witches and burn em flick. I guess Ill do my best to hunt that one down.Rating 3 out of 5".

It isn't on the same level as cult movies like Witchfinder General also starring Vincent Price but it does have it's moments. Here Vincent Price plays a wicked lord with a very strange family.

Nobody else on the cast is particularly noteworthy but on the whole it's a fairly competent movie as far as the acting is concerned. On the subject of the script it does seem to be thing that everyone involved struggled with. The movie had already been sold to the distributors which meant that the director rewriters and so on couldn't change it as much as they would probably have liked to so they didn't necessary end up making the movie they wanted to make.This accounts for the way that some aspects of the film are so much better than others. In some scenes the actors themselves seem pretty bored with it whereas in others the relish in the opportunity to show their full talent. The scenes involving the witches coven are pretty interesting and some of the climatic moments are particularly wellshot. Also the opening credits sequence is instantly recognisable as the work of Monty Python's artist Terry Gilliam which is pretty neat.

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING TO PARENTS Unlike almost all of Vincent Price's other horror films this one has significant amounts of sex and nuditysome of which is rather violent and nonconsensual. It is definitely NOT a film for young children. The nudity is all very exploitative and the torture scenes are rather intense. Exercise common sense when considering allowing your kids to see this very Rrated film.This film is highly reminiscent of several of Price's other films of the era such as WITCHFINDER GENERAL and DIARY OF A MADMAN. Each had to do with a magistrate who dispenses severe judgment in a sadistic and savage mannermost often with accused witches or innocent sexy ladies. And in each film this supposed doer of good is actually much more wicked and worldly than the people he judges.This particular film is set during the Tudor period in England. Price is lord of a manor and takes great delight in killing torturing and raping accused witches. This time however he's not alone in his duty as his son seems to be a chip off the old blockand he too spends much of his time tormenting young maidens and his daughter takes delight in seducing men as well. It's so bad that the locals actually would probably prefer to have the town overrun with witchesthey couldn't be nearly as wicked as Price's foul brood. So it's up to the surviving witches to come to the rescue and purge this town of this ruling family.Despite Price's character being 100 scum there is a big plot hole in the film. When Oona the witch and her band of witches are caught having one of their ceremonies half of them are hacked to death by Price's band of thugs. Then inexplicably he lets Oona and a few of the survivors to go!! This makes even less sense when Oona tells Price that she'll get revenge!! At this point why didn't he just blow her head off and be done with it?! If I were this evil and someone threatened to kill me I sure would have had them killed instantly! So apparently Price is evil AND stupid! So it's certainly no surprise to anyone but Price when Oona releases the powers of Satan on him and his wicked family.As you can tell by my description so far this is not typical of Vincent Price's other horror films. While in many he plays wicked men who abuse their power none are as sensual or sexually abusive as this film. Some may like this style of film but many will likely be turned off by the nudity and in particular the rapes and sexual abuse. It just seems to cross the linemaking the film a lot less fun than the usual Price horror film. Plus audience members who have experienced sexual abuse themselves might find this all very disturbing indeed.Now this isn't to say that this is a poor quality film aside from some cheesy hell hound scenes. In fact in many ways it's much better made than the Roger Corman films of the 1960s that made Price so famous. The cinematography sets twist ending and acting are all pretty goodbut also very gritty and unpleasant as wellthough you no doubt will enjoy seeing the hell hound rip this wicked clan to pieces and seeing others driven insane! All in all a very scary but even more unpleasant filmone that lacks fun or charm and can be a chore to watch. I think BaronBl00d's review put it best when it described the film as ...one of the most depraved heartless cold centers of any film I have seen in a long time. I certainly can't recommend it and hope never to see this film againeven thought I really do like Price's horror films.By the way in a funny mistake in the film watch the scene where an accused witch is being roasted over a fire. She screams and screams so much that Price's nice son comes to her rescue. Now here's the funny partas this son fights with the torturer the lady just hangs there and just blandly looks onand doesn't scream at all even though she STILL is hanging over the fire!! Then when the fight is over she begins screaming again! It's all very poorly done and gave me a chuckle.".

	schema:headline " Underrated mystery";
	schema:reviewBody "I haven't watched this film in probably 20 years and I had forgotten a lot of the plot but I watched it again recently and it reminded me that this was one of the most unique and interesting mysteries I have ever seen. Story starts out with a young doctor named Robert Graves Tim Curry who comes to an insane asylum to help keep score of a cricket match between the inmates and the staff and sitting beside Robert is a man named Crossley Alan Bates who starts to tell him the story of how he ended up there. Crossley was in Devon England and meets Anthony Fielding John Hurt who plays the organ in church but is always experimenting with music and sounds and Crossley invites himself over for lunch. He meets Anthony's wife Rachel Susannah York and during lunch he tells them he spent 18 years with the aborigines in the outback and that he had killed his own children and learned some of the aborigine black magic. He spends the night but early the next morning Crossley and Anthony walk out to a secluded area because Crossley mentioned that he learned The Shout that can kill anything in the general area. Anthony puts wax in his ears and Crossley does his Shout. It kills a local sheep herder and the sheep and Anthony is saved by the wax. Crossley possesses Rachels buckle from her sandal which he uses to put a spell on her to possess her as well. These scenes are shown in flashbacks and we're not sure if this is just a madeup story from a crazy man or the real deal. We know some of it is made up because we see York's character as a nurse. The film is directed by Jerzy Skolimowski and along with the Jeremy Irons film Moonlighting he shows good patience in the way he tells the stories in his films. This is a very effective mystery and their are lots of images that flash during the film that are cause for discussion and one that pops in my mind is that in Anthony's work room there is a photo tacked to the wall of someone or something on all fours. Later Rachel is nude in the bedroom waiting for Crossley and she gets on all fours that mirrors the image in the photo! The performances are excellent and Bates brooding nature is put to good use here. His quiet but demanding persona is totally believable. I really enjoyed York in this film and the nudity that she is asked to do here reminded me that English actress's have an entirely different attitude toward nudity in films. York was always an excellent actress and she was very popular in the sixties and seventies and her performance here shows why. This is a film that is intended for mature audiences who are not afraid to view something that leaves some questions. This reminded me of two other films Don't Look Now and The Wicker Man which didn't cater to a less sophisticated mindset. Well made and extremely effective.".

	onyx:emotionText "I haven't watched this film in probably 20 years and I had forgotten a lot of the plot but I watched it again recently and it reminded me that this was one of the most unique and interesting mysteries I have ever seen. Story starts out with a young doctor named Robert Graves Tim Curry who comes to an insane asylum to help keep score of a cricket match between the inmates and the staff and sitting beside Robert is a man named Crossley Alan Bates who starts to tell him the story of how he ended up there. Crossley was in Devon England and meets Anthony Fielding John Hurt who plays the organ in church but is always experimenting with music and sounds and Crossley invites himself over for lunch. He meets Anthony's wife Rachel Susannah York and during lunch he tells them he spent 18 years with the aborigines in the outback and that he had killed his own children and learned some of the aborigine black magic. He spends the night but early the next morning Crossley and Anthony walk out to a secluded area because Crossley mentioned that he learned The Shout that can kill anything in the general area. Anthony puts wax in his ears and Crossley does his Shout. It kills a local sheep herder and the sheep and Anthony is saved by the wax. Crossley possesses Rachels buckle from her sandal which he uses to put a spell on her to possess her as well. These scenes are shown in flashbacks and we're not sure if this is just a madeup story from a crazy man or the real deal. We know some of it is made up because we see York's character as a nurse. The film is directed by Jerzy Skolimowski and along with the Jeremy Irons film Moonlighting he shows good patience in the way he tells the stories in his films. This is a very effective mystery and their are lots of images that flash during the film that are cause for discussion and one that pops in my mind is that in Anthony's work room there is a photo tacked to the wall of someone or something on all fours. Later Rachel is nude in the bedroom waiting for Crossley and she gets on all fours that mirrors the image in the photo! The performances are excellent and Bates brooding nature is put to good use here. His quiet but demanding persona is totally believable. I really enjoyed York in this film and the nudity that she is asked to do here reminded me that English actress's have an entirely different attitude toward nudity in films. York was always an excellent actress and she was very popular in the sixties and seventies and her performance here shows why. This is a film that is intended for mature audiences who are not afraid to view something that leaves some questions. This reminded me of two other films Don't Look Now and The Wicker Man which didn't cater to a less sophisticated mindset. Well made and extremely effective.";

An abnormal mental patient Crossley Alan Bates tells a story of himself which may or may not be true to a young confused looking Tim Curry during a mental institution run cricket match. He tells of how he selfimposed his way into the home of an experimental musique concrte composer Anthony John Hurt who records all sorts of fascinating sounds and noises and then manipulates them with his ministudio of electronic equipment and his wife Rachel Susannah York. Inside the flashbackflash forwardflash sideways he tells them of a unique ability he has perfected which he learned from an aboriginal medicine man while living in the Australian outback. It seems he can perform a shout that will kill anyone within a surrounding radius. He demonstrates The Shout to Anthony and unknowingly kills a local farmer. His presence in Anthony's home quickly becomes awkward and unwanted but he continues to force his stay with intimidation. He uses his mysterious mystical abilities to entrance Rachel into becoming almost rabid for him and taunts Anthony with his conquest and powers. Anthony humiliated and overpowered in his own home and life searches desperately for a way to defeat Crossley searches for the source of his soul.Skolimowski uses the music and sounds that are recorded by John Hurt's character on screen in real life made by Rupert Hine as the metaphysical soul to this cinematic nightmare similar in the ways David Lynch uses sound design as both an audio and visually integral mood stabilizing component in his nightmaredream poems or how Nicolas Roeg uses fractured time and images to a disorientating hypnotic effect. In fact it feels very analogous to a Roeg film. Highly recommended.".

It can cause instant death when heard. Soon Charles settles into the homestead where he has Anthony and Rachael under his thumb as he fears him and she's infatuated by him.Weird baffling and truly novel passes through my mind whenever I watch this sedately complex courageous and alienating late 70's British experimental thriller. The way it has layer upon layer goes on to ambitiously build a minor and gripping structure which its inspired psychological strangle hold and mystical air takes shape as to how genuine the pieces are and if they do come together. Does it make sense? Well it's hard to say what the bigger picture means but it is indeed curiously haunting daunting and truly unpredictable. The nonlinear story and compact script chips away with plenty of cryptic messages intercutting the soft dreamlike touch brought on by director Jerzy Skolimowski. He gives the film such an hypnotic appeal amongst its arty brushes where its swirling electronic score peaks in the right places and Mick Molloy's sublime framing emits elegant photography work. Those scenes involving the 'shout' are lethal and only increase to the lurking eeriness created by topnotch sound FX. Visually the film has a powerful isolated and lush setting that works with the story's spiritual and supernatural journey. The three lead performances are sensational but it's Alan Bates who dominates the show with his startling and obscure turn as the tramppatient. John Hurt as the downtrodden turned bewitched composer gives in a stellar performance and Susanna York as his wife is also great. The talented Tim Curry shows up in a small but effective role.Quite an unusual puzzle which is strangely compelling unique and very well made.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers  Spoilers  SpoilersFilms like this one act as fairy tales in that their audiences are asked to participate in the creation of wonder and not be passive recipients of entertainment. Here the onlooker must balance the two extremes of suggestibility and critical analysis. One must be both a child and an adult  submissive to what is happening while maintaining one's analytical faculties at maximum intensity. When one assumes such a posture with patience The Shout yields profound symbols and meanings. It is an example of what I shall call the apotheosis of the everyday in which ordinariness itself becomes the principal matrix of magic and mystery. It does not hinge on impressions of dread terror or revulsion. It is more properly described as weird in the sense of a quiet eeriness as though the surface of life were intact but underlying structures of meaning are vaguely warped. In weirdness we feel that something we cannot point our finger on is askew but we cannot explain what we mean. Orderly networks of logic feel undermined.  Criteria for distinguishing between the important and the trivial become an existential hall of mirrors in which escape and sanity are only two of an infinite number of reflections. Everything in this movie refers to everything else In The Shout one man in a mental asylum the mysterious Charles Crossley Alan Bates relates a strange tale to Robert Tim Curry a visitor to the asylum. This narrative technique of a storywithinastory invests the film with a reflexivity such that movie watchers become codreamers in this cinematic dreamwithinadream. Just as the character Robert cannot decide whether the described events actually happened or are merely the ravings of a lunatic so we the viewers must ponder whether this is just a movie or some kind of sardonic documentary. The strange works of English painter Francis Bacon appear throughout the house in which the story is set and with them the outrageous incongruities and silent howls that punctuated Bacon's oeuvre. Spatial proportions are alternately affirmed and subverted as doors slam camera angles vary and a shots of ordinary things alternate with ominous scenes of understated shock.The film's story swirls JudeoChristianity animism and contemporary psychological theory into a kaleidoscope of mysterious couldbe's. Enigma prevails at all times such that the film defies attempts at summations that would tie it off into neat little knots and bows. Like any fairy tale the film does not simply afford us an escape it rearranges everything from social stratification to value judgments and thereby suggests that freedom and renewal remain possible at all times. This is a fairy tale for highly educated adults who are sufficiently mature in their estimations of religion and self to be able to concede that We just don't know. All the archetypes of the occult are here. For example Crossley as the embodiment of crass evil or is he? cannot enter into Antony's and Rachel's life and house until he is invited in for lunch. He relishes Rachel's offering of a simple glass of water symbolically infused with her energy that he gulps down. Inside the house a toy figure of a bee hangs from the ceiling and camera angles frequently have that bee chance to hover over Crossley's head signifying his possible ability to change into a bird insect or other animal in alignment with the folklore of Australian aborigines and other peoples. The Beelzebub buzzing of a bee figures into Antony's own work as an experimental musician as he plays with microphones and sounds. Indeed sound  buzzing music thunder bells shouting  is the principal medium that weaves the story's elements together. Other occult stories pivot on senses such as smell  sulfur feces rose perfume musty paper etc.  or sight ghosts apparitions UFOs elves dark strangers etc. When a skeptical Antony is exposed to Crossley's awful shout Antony tumbles down a sand dune hearing millions of bells like those described by meditative adepts in certain states or by those who claim to have near death experiences. Antony and Rachel themselves live near a craggy beach an interface between land and sea between normalcy and bizarre potential a threshold where the sound of waves crashes all the time. Indeed waves bells roaring buzzing and thunder are part of the mystic and occult traditions of India and other lands. On the other hand let us remember that Crossley's account is naught but a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing as quoted by one character at movie's end. Or is it? What is significant in the story and what is inconsequential? We just do not know. Or is it all just so much rot? In critiquing cinema as in our regular lives it seems that we make our choices by subjective impulse and live by those choices as though we grasped absolute truth. But mystery remains at the heart of everything. Fans of mystery enjoy watching the unknown be progressively solved but there is value in a mystery remaining a mystery. To solve a mystery is to be rendered ravenous for a new mystery a continually bigger or more unique mystery. An encounter with the unsolvable however leaves one deliciously humble.There are so many symbolic references and counterreferences throughout this movie that one cannot help but be impressed with the intricacy of its crafting. Granted the film is so dense that it will polarize audiences into staunch advocates and bitter foes. One reviewer described it as a murky DUD. But aren't all our personal lives in a sense a murky DUD?  Or are they filled with a wondrous madness that we dare not acknowledge? Are we dreaming gods or just termites in a global mound? Who knows?".

Other occult stories pivot on senses such as smell  sulfur feces rose perfume musty paper etc.  or sight ghosts apparitions UFOs elves dark strangers etc. When a skeptical Antony is exposed to Crossley's awful shout Antony tumbles down a sand dune hearing millions of bells like those described by meditative adepts in certain states or by those who claim to have near death experiences. Antony and Rachel themselves live near a craggy beach an interface between land and sea between normalcy and bizarre potential a threshold where the sound of waves crashes all the time. Indeed waves bells roaring buzzing and thunder are part of the mystic and occult traditions of India and other lands. On the other hand let us remember that Crossley's account is naught but a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing as quoted by one character at movie's end. Or is it? What is significant in the story and what is inconsequential? We just do not know. Or is it all just so much rot? In critiquing cinema as in our regular lives it seems that we make our choices by subjective impulse and live by those choices as though we grasped absolute truth. But mystery remains at the heart of everything. Fans of mystery enjoy watching the unknown be progressively solved but there is value in a mystery remaining a mystery. To solve a mystery is to be rendered ravenous for a new mystery a continually bigger or more unique mystery. An encounter with the unsolvable however leaves one deliciously humble.There are so many symbolic references and counterreferences throughout this movie that one cannot help but be impressed with the intricacy of its crafting. Granted the film is so dense that it will polarize audiences into staunch advocates and bitter foes. One reviewer described it as a murky DUD. But aren't all our personal lives in a sense a murky DUD?  Or are they filled with a wondrous madness that we dare not acknowledge? Are we dreaming gods or just termites in a global mound? Who knows?";

	schema:reviewBody "This is a strange film about a sinister man named Crossley Alan Bates who invades the lives of a man John Hurt and his wife Susannah York in a sleepy English town. He tells the story to a fellow scorer at a cricket match Tim Curry and we are left to try and disentangle it.Crossley tells the couple that he spent eighteen years in the Australian outback and that he killed his children when they were born. He also tells them he met a magical man in the outback who taught him how to shout to kill. The scene when Crossley 'shouts' on the sand dunes is good. The shout kills sheep birds and a shepherd. The sound is good too. The film was made in Dolby system sound which is rare for that time. During the 'shout' the effect is impressive. The ending is rather weird. Alan Bates is good as the creepy Crossley. It's an odd film that is curiously compelling to watch.".

In fact the film may have been more effective as a short were it not that the sleepy pace lends it a dreamlike and ethereal feel that is totally shattered when the shout is heard. The Shout itself is so built up that one can only expect disappointment. Yet when it finally is heard it is truly horrific and you will jump out of your seat. The scene on the sand dunes as Alan Bates yells out death to all around him and sheep are swept down dead by the cry is masterful. Similarly effective is the soundtrack by Genesis' Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford mainly based around reworkings of themes from Banks' album A Curious Feeling a gorgeously nostalgic sequence of music that is inventively brought into the film as a lowkey presence faintly playing in the background as if echoing on the breeze and used by John Hurt on the church organ. The man from nowhere character Alan Bates presents is fascinating and a nice change of style for him and it seems strange how rarely this film is aired on television and how hard it is to locate on video despite its excellent cast and original realisation. A little known but fascinating tale of the uncanny presented like an adult fairy tale.".

First we see a woman drive up to a building. She is ushered into a room where there are three dead men apparently naked laid out under white sheets on what seem to be dining tables. She stops at the third one. Then we see an black likely aboriginal man wandering in a desert or among sand dunes and he approaches with a sharp bone.

The other scorekeeper one of the patients starts to tell him a story....That's a lot of jumping around just to start the film! There are layers in the film due to the storytelling and not everything is chronological and perhaps not everything is even true.The story involves the man telling the story Alan Bates and one of the men playing cricket John Hurt. John Hurt's character plays organ at a church when he gets there on time anyway and at home records a variety of sounds amplifying them in such a way they sound unusual. He meets Alan Bates a strange man who had learned some aboriginal magic when he lived in Australia and Bates manages to enter Hurt's home and life.The story structure and the involvement of an asylum called to mind The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari for me and now seeing the comments of others I see I'm not alone. One other movie that came to mind while watching The Shout was Picnic at Hanging Rock 1975 because of the Australian weirdness and artiness in both films.I can't claim to understand everything in the film. For example at one point a character wakes up and he's temporarily confused about his identity and profession a problem that reoccurs at least once thereafter. Additionally there's some digging in the sand for rocks which seem related to people somehow. In spite of this or perhaps because of this to a degree I like some mystery sometimes I enjoyed the movie and I'm glad I bought it.".

The story details in flashback how Bates came between a man Hurt who happens to be playing in the match as a doctor I believe and his wife York who is seen at the beginning and end of the film as a nurse at the asylum. Man where's this movie been all my life? Brilliant absolutely brilliant but mysteriously forgotten British psycho horror flick of the late 70s that features among everything else an A1 cast. It reminds me once again how dumb the Hannibal movies are. Ever get the feeling Anthony Hopkins realizes this too? Watch him sometimes when he thinks the camera isn't on him he's laughing his butt off. Sorry if you like disturbing well made horror films that delve into the subject of madness and perspective vs. reality? You will like this. The old gimmick of Dr. Caligari has been used and abused but this film plays honest because you know from the outset that a madman is narrating the story. The film is effective enough not to have to resort to springing that on you as surprise ending. You know that Bates is in a nuthouse going in and are reminded of it throughout but somehow you still forget it or get confused about it as you get absorbed into the action. And what's even more upsetting is the footage at the asylum doesn't ring true either if you know what I mean. Again what is real? You're asking the wrong bloke I'm sure I don't get it at all but I love it and I recommend it unreservedly. Taken from a story by the immortal Robert Graves. A must see!".

Admittedly I don't understand the ending but I don't even care  it still feels climactic and satisfying and most outstanding dreams are not fully explicable either... for fans of any and all oddities... this one is not to be missed.";

Beautifully shot and edited almost like a music video which makes sense because the story is about the sound. The scenes of experiments with sound effects seem like performanceinstallation pieces from an era when conceptual art made sense. The banality of the story is avoided because... it's just a story from a loony bin. The whole film is a flashback. The characters seen during the cricket match may or may not be husband and wife the story could be just a figment of lunatic's imagination. The horror is in the mind and becomes a fascination. The cast is superb and as natural as the light. Nudity was not an issue for such acting talents back then. It was just natural.".

I wish those who complain of its obscurity would be more specific about what points exactly and unclear to them. Perhaps these people fail to grasp the basic witchcraft premises on which Crossley's power is based though to me the film in itself makes these perfectly clear.

A second viewing helped me piece together a few more plot strands such as the significance of certain objects such as bones and a lost belt buckle but also left me with a few more unanswered questions.From reading some other people's thoughts on The Shout it seems to get compared to films such as Don't Look Now The Wicker Man and Picnic at Hanging Rock. While I don't think it's quite as good as any of those I would recommend it to fans of those titles. It fits into the mould of the more artsy genre films of the 70s where the storytelling is complex and in this case rewards the discerning viewers attention.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Shout is one of the funniest film comedies in cinema history. It just doesn't know it. That this material could be played for anything but laughs is astounding to me but the actors carry it off with the traditional British stiff upper lip. I often wonder what the actors are thinking in a picture like this. Do they realize it's junk and the only way to save it is to play it totally straight and hope it passes for camp? The movie is about this nutty wanderer Alan Bates who drifts into the life of an unsuspecting couple John Hurt and Susannah York regaling them with tales of his Aboriginal exploits and his shout the ferocity of which is so extreme he claims it could kill a man. This socalled terror shout hangs over the movie like an unwanted guest at a dinner party you know is going to show up. There's an element of dread not of suspense but of disappointment. You figure it's got to be stupid.So while we're waiting for the big shout Bates manages to slowly devour the household by getting Miss York to fall in love with him and tearing at Hurt's confidence. Hurt plays an aspiring musician with a makeshift recording studio in his home but he's going for sound not music. He records himself moaning and captures the drone of a buzzing fly trapped inside a jam jar he's like a lowgrade Yoko Ono it's trainingwheel avantgardism. When Bates tells him accurately I've heard your music it's empty  it's uproariously funny because of the tone. Bates talks like a doctor informing you you have six weeks to live. Susannah York has a sexy big body but her manner is so without charm or nuance that she is little more than a plot function she mediates the tension between Bates and Hurt and that's about it. Then finally the moment of truth arrives and Bates demonstrates his death call pretty impressive actually in an open dune. When the sheep start keeling over in a nearby pasture and Hurt rolls down the hill in a neoPeckinpah slomo shot it's almost too much to keep a straight face. It is the single best piece of camp since the spikethroughthehead in Berserk. There's one more great bit when Bates sitting snugly with York tells Hurt We're going to make love so you'd better make yourself scarce and Hurt stands there with this pained little boy look. When he objects Bates counters with Get out or I'll shout the hell out of you. You simply can't place a value on this kind of dialogue. It couldn't possibly have been written it seems ordained somehow a gift from the gods.The one truly weak bit of business in the movie is the crosscutting from the domestic drama to a mental institution where staff and patients are engaged in a cricket match. It probably fails because it tries to be amusing we're supposed to laugh when one loony during an outbreak of rain goes into hysterics. But the beauty of camp is that it's unintentionally hilarious you can't set out to create it it just materializes. It's a vacuous form of artistic achievement like hitting the PickSix. There's no way I can defend The Shout as a good movie or even a good thriller it is truly in a class by itself. And any remaining prints of it belong in a room by itself.".

Still there's a strong cast on hand Alan Bates who has had perhaps the most interesting if largely unsung career from the British New Wave's flock of Angry Young Men  I followed this with one of his early films THE CARETAKER 1963 via the BFI's R2 SE DVD Susannah York and John Hurt in the lead roles and in support Robert Stephens Tim Curry and an impossibly young  and thin  Jim Broadbent.Bates and Hurt play typical roles  the former eccentric the latter bewildered  but their rapport and the one each shares with York is what holds the film together. There's also an effective electronic score by two members of the then progrock band Genesis appropriate considering that Hurt plays a musician with a penchant for experimentation with everyday sounds! The scenes involving Bates' deadly shout are very well handled its Aborogine connection links the film with another strange contemporary title Peter Weir's THE LAST WAVE 1977 which I've only watched once but remember liking a lot  so much so that I considered purchasing the Criterion DVD despite its being one of their lowertier releases then again THE SHOUT is an absolutely nofrills edition but at least it was dirtcheap!.If there's any complaint I have to make about the DVD it's the fact that the audio level is rather low and consequently the dialogue  part heavy British accents and part Bates' whispered delivery  is unintelligible at times which can become frustrating given that this is largely a dialoguedriven film!.".

Secondly there is no real set. Sure there is a hall there are chairs tables and a bar but that's all. There is nothing to hide the fact that it is not a real bar but a studio. This brings Le Paltoquet as close as possible to a filmed stage version.It reminds me of Dogville but I enjoyed it a lot more. These actors have to compensate for the emptiness of the sets with their charm. The best part is that all kinds of famous French actors Daniel Auteuil Michel Piccoli Jean Yann Jeanne Moreau and Fanny Ardant were likely enjoying this experiment. The famous actors in Dogville probably did that as well but somehow that movie lacked cheerful anarchism and gave me the feeling that most of the actors probably played in that film to boost their resumes. I treasure the bizarre moments when Piccoli presses a button and puts everything on hold. Just as the bartender provides the thrilling music himself by turning on a pickup and pointing towards the door where the commissioner comes bursting through. The film does indeed have some shortcomings the dialogue is not that sparkling and the characters remain flat but simply getting a experimental film made like this was a great feat.".

He meets a destitute patient Susan Oliver and then the fun begins. These sequences provide a little of the film's serious side but overall the slapstick and Jerry's mugging are hilarious. Even the kids will get a hoot out of this. Highly recommended for family viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Jerry Lewis had a strong director like Frank Tashlin who had his own ideas about comedy both could turn in a really good film. The Disorderly Orderly ranks up there as one of Lewis's best solo films.The Disorderly Orderly casts Jerry as a would be doctor who but for one thing might have his MD degree he's a natural born klutz. He's working at a private hospital where every task he's given turns into a disaster. He'd be fired but for the fact that the hospital head Glenda Farrell was once involved with Jerry's father and she looks on him as a child with special needs. The head nurse played by Lewis film regular Kathleen Freeman would like to strangle him as does Everett Sloane the chairman of the hospital board after a couple of encounters with him.It's a psychological block that Jerry has he empathizes too much with the patients and he tries too hard. The scene that brings that out is when he has to listen to Alice Pearce as one of the patients go through her laundry list of ailments. Lewis's reactions are positively hysterical.Truth be told not everything is his fault. There's a surreal scene where Jerry is trying to fix patient Barbara Nichols's television of the snow showing. He opens it up and an arctic blast comes through the television. Truly not his fault but also very funny.As it turns out the cause of his complex arrives at the hospital in the person of Susan Oliver who was a prom queen back in his high school who Jerry didn't have the nerve to approach. Contact with her cures him though not the way you think or what you think.Lewis's performance hits on all levels from the screamingly funny to a sad kind of pathos especially involving Oliver. His relationship with her as an innocent reminds me a lot of Lou Costello in several of his films.The last ten minutes involving a chase scene with two ambulances reminds me of the chase in The Bank Dick later revived in In Society. There's also a nice cameo from Jack E. Leonard as another patient who gets the better of Jerry.The Disorderly Orderly is an absolute must for Jerry Lewis fans of yesterday and today it belongs at the top of his comedy classics.".

One hero must be chosen and since they are all standing the chosen one does not stand up.  He falls.Jerome Littlefield wants to be a doctor.  But he is very clumsy and a hypochondriac whatever symptoms he hears described he gets.  So he must settle for being an orderly.  Dr. Howard who runs the Whitestone Sanatarium where Jerome works has faith in Jerome but why anyone would is a mystery.Jerome dates a nurse named Julie but he falls for Susan who attempted suicide.  So which one will he choose in the end?A highlight of this movie is a car chase near the end.  Actually car chase doesn't even begin to describe what happened.  It's a wild ride full of physical comedy and the grocery store has the best of that.Lewis is wonderful as a clown and he can even act when he's not being funny making us care for the character.   Kathleen Freeman is also good as a nurse who is almost as crazy as the patients.  Everett Sloane makes a deliciously evil Mr. Tuffington the president of the hospital board who is only concerned about profits believing the real money is in mental problems especially those of rich celebrities.  And one rich celebrity is Fat Jack who is hilarious in one brief scene.Some examples of physical comedy  Jerome tries to fix a TV set which has snow on screen.  Opening it up he finds real snow coming out of the TV.  I think that particular gag was overdone.Jerome brushes a patient's teeth before realizing they were in a glass beside the bed.Jerome makes a mess in a supply room a mess which migrates into the hall and causes what seems like every staff member in the place to fall down.One patient is wrapped up like a mummy.  Jerome accidentally bumps the patient who rolls downhill and breaks apart.SPOILERS followIt was touching to see Jerome work extra hard to make sure Susan's bills were paid. I didn't like the romantic stuff all that much and Susan wasn't that likeable a character at least not to me.Jerome dumps paint on Mr. Tuffington while he is working so hard getting himself fired and then Mr. Tuffington has an accident that leads to him needing to be taken to the hospital in an ambulancewhich Jerome steals when he realizes he could lose the girl he wants not knowing Mr. Tuffington is in back!  And then the fun begins. At one point the doors open and Mr. Tuffington starts rolling downhill!  Eventually the ambulance loses its driver and goes on a rampage.".

However I really think they are an uneven lot. Some are quite clever and well doneothers suffer from one major problema lack of subtlety. Jokes are often taken to such extremes and Jerry's reactions are so intense that it loses me. As I said however this isn't always trueplus I love him in dramas I think he actually is great in these. In the case of The Disorderly Orderly I tried but just couldn't enjoy the film. Too often his overreactions just lost me and few of the skits came close to eliciting a chuckle...but nothing more. Additionally the plot itself made little sense such as Why did Miss Blair even like him?!. Very weak. My advice is that if you like this very broad humor by all means watch it. However films like The Bellboy The Delicate Delinquent and The Ladies Man are much better and are well worth your time.UPDATE I saw this movie again a few days ago at the TCM Classic Movie Cruise. It was introduced by Lewis himself and the audience seemed to love itwith tons of laughs and snickers. Still despite enjoying seeing Lewis interviewed I was left feeling that the film was much like The Bellboy in that it was very episodic...but unlike The Bellboy its jokes fell flat almost every time. Perhaps I'd rate this one a 4 at second viewing...perhaps not. All I know is that I still didn't understand folks' love for this picture.".

	schema:headline " Harmless Slapstick From More Innocent Times";
	schema:reviewBody "To me the films of Jerry Lewis are guilty cinematic pleasures up  or should that be down?  there along with the 'Airport' disaster movies Britain's 'Confessions Of' series and the Dean Martin 'Matt Helm' pictures.Whenever one aired on U.K. television in the '70's it was like a Royal Wedding 'Live Aid' and 'Concert For Diana' all rolled into one. There was no simply no way I was going to miss a Jerry Lewis movie.He basically played the same character over and over again  the gormless goofball a child inhabiting a man's body 'Forrest Gump' meets 'Inspector Clouseau'  and that's why we loved him.In 'The Disorderly Orderly' he is Jerome Littlefield an accidentprone orderly at a private hospital. If anything can go wrong when he's around it will. Ask him to fix a television set and he will break it beyond repair. Tell him to brush someone's teeth and he won't bother to check to see whether the patient actually has them in his mouth. If he smashes a bottle of pills nurses will step on them and go flying like skittles.As one would expect from a Frank Tashlin film its full of inventive sight gags and Lewis performs them in his own wonderful crazy way. The climax in which he chases a patient rolling down a steep hill on a gurney will have you goggling in disbelief even now. No C.G.I. in those days folks! Incredible stuff.Not so hot is the romantic subplot in which Lewis comes to the aid of wouldbe suicide patient Susan Oliver. Like Chaplin before him Lewis combined comedy and pathos but not so successfully. One of the great things about D.V.D. is that one can fast forward the soppy stuff to get to the really good bits  of which there are many .We are far away from the '60's to have reached the point where movies such as this now represent nostalgia. Yet 'The Disorderly Orderly' does not depict the world as it was but as it should have been a land where women wore Edith Head clothes everything looked colourful and shiny noone swore or did terrible things and even idiots like Jerome got the girl at the end.Lewis had burned himself out by the late '60's but when ablaze he was a comedy supernova.".

There was no simply no way I was going to miss a Jerry Lewis movie.He basically played the same character over and over again  the gormless goofball a child inhabiting a man's body 'Forrest Gump' meets 'Inspector Clouseau'  and that's why we loved him.In 'The Disorderly Orderly' he is Jerome Littlefield an accidentprone orderly at a private hospital. If anything can go wrong when he's around it will. Ask him to fix a television set and he will break it beyond repair. Tell him to brush someone's teeth and he won't bother to check to see whether the patient actually has them in his mouth. If he smashes a bottle of pills nurses will step on them and go flying like skittles.As one would expect from a Frank Tashlin film its full of inventive sight gags and Lewis performs them in his own wonderful crazy way. The climax in which he chases a patient rolling down a steep hill on a gurney will have you goggling in disbelief even now. No C.G.I. in those days folks! Incredible stuff.Not so hot is the romantic subplot in which Lewis comes to the aid of wouldbe suicide patient Susan Oliver. Like Chaplin before him Lewis combined comedy and pathos but not so successfully. One of the great things about D.V.D. is that one can fast forward the soppy stuff to get to the really good bits  of which there are many .We are far away from the '60's to have reached the point where movies such as this now represent nostalgia. Yet 'The Disorderly Orderly' does not depict the world as it was but as it should have been a land where women wore Edith Head clothes everything looked colourful and shiny noone swore or did terrible things and even idiots like Jerome got the girl at the end.Lewis had burned himself out by the late '60's but when ablaze he was a comedy supernova.";

Pretty much most of the movie features him getting into a series of embarrassing situations. I personally think that they could have just left it at that and avoided the love story.And yes that's Alice Pearce as the overcommunicative Miss Fuzzibee right before she got the role of a certain nosy neighbor suspicious that there's a witch or something in the neighborhood. All in all The Disorderly Orderly is classic comedy at its best. You gotta wonder how they did some of those scenes. Also starring Kathleen Freeman.".

	schema:reviewBody "I could watch the lengthy chase sequence ar the end of this film over and over and laugh hysterically at the site gags. That's the highlight of this big hearted Jerry Lewis farce that reunites him once again with Kathleen Freeman. Veteran 30's brassy blonde Glenda Farrell in her last screen role plays the gentle chief of staff at the hospital Lewis works at as an orderly sharing with brash nurse Freeman why she has a soft spot for the clumsy Lewis. The big hearted Jerry finds out that troubled suicidal patient Susan Oliver is about to be transferred to the local general hospital since she has no money to pay her bill and works nearly around the clock to secretly help her out. Sweet nurse Karen Sharpe is in love with Lewis herself and misunderstandings keeps them from getting together as does a misunderstood kiss Sharp's he's going on between Lewis and Oliver. This leads to the hysterical chase sequence at the end where the nasty head of the hospital board Everett Sloane is trapped on a stretcher in the back of the ambulance that Lewis is driving to get to Sharp to explain the misunderstanding. Another ambulance has Farrell and Freeman chasing after them emphasis on the fact that when she was in the Army Freeman drove a tank!Freeman's nurse is the epitome of the serious no nonsense medical professional represented on the daytime soap opera General Hospital at the time by the rigid nurse Lucille March nicknamed Sarge. That could be the nickname for Freeman's character here too because the more humorless she becomes the funnier she is! An angry patient throws a cup of pudding at Lewis hitting Freeman in the face and after having dealt with a hefty sleeping patient trying to change her sheets this breaks the usually controlled Freeman into a hysterical valley of tears. Farrell who played many wisecracking golddiggers with Joan Blondell in the 1930s is the total antithesis here although she does get a few cracks in at the nasty Sloane whose character certainly deserves the fate that he gets in the hysterical conclusion.As for all Oliver it was difficult to sympathize with her after her initial breakdown scene because she is completely rude to Lewis who only wants to try to make her feel better. There is a background story explained for Lewis's feelings for Oliver but after seeing how she treated Luis it is difficult to have any sympathy for her character. Sharps sweet nurse is much more deserving of his love. The chase sequence which closes the film out and lasts about 10 minutes is up there with the comic chase sequences in What's Up Doc Foul Play and The Blues Brothers. It utilizes scenes of the San Gabriel Valley very well and will have you in hysterics.The cast of patients doctors and nurses is rounded out with some very well known character actors most notably Alice Pearce as a hypochondriac patient whose illnesses she believes are much more serious than any other patients in the hospital the scene where she tells a patient of her ordeals while Lewis cringes in the background is hysterically funny. Veteran comic Jack Leonard has a funny moment as a crazy TV actor whom Lewis is ordered to get into a straight jacket with failing results. Blonde sexpot Barbara Nichols has a very funny Cameo where Lewis tries to fix her snowy TV.the film overall flows very quickly has many laughs and Lewis manages to get through this without being too obnoxious in his attempts to out stage everybody and thus his character is much more likeable than normal. It is one of his films that I can watch over and over and still find many things to laugh at something that I can't say about most of his films.".

Without Martin's straight man Lewis did much more goofy stuff mostly in antics. It was reminiscent of the type of slapstick and mayhem that the Three Stooges created. Only this is one character and the running string of mishaps and goofs begin to tire after a while.One might think that there is something about the differences in cultures of the times. For this film seemed funnier to audiences in 1964 than it does several decades later. So the humor or type of humor clearly is dated.The only characters of notable roles are Nurse Maggie Higgins and Mr. Tuffington. They are played very well by Kathleen Freeman and Everett Sloane. It doesn't take much acting for Jerry Lewis to play Jerome Littlefield. He's the usual stumblebum character of most of his film.This isn't a bad film but many audiences in the 21st century might find it very slow or boring.".

At the last minute Radcliffe's gal pal Helen Nan Grey and the friendly mad doctor Frank Griffin John Sutton decide the only way to save Radcliffe is by injecting him with the invisibility serum invented by Jack Griffin. Radcliffe's invisibility enables him to escape the gallows and easily elude the police led by the wily Inspector Sampson Cecil Kelloway.  Radcliffe figures out the identity of the murderer but his behavior soon borders on madness unsettling Dr. Griffin and Helen.  Should they continue to aid Radcliffe or rat him out to the constabulary?  Will Radcliffe remain sane long enough to clear his name or will the law have to gun him down like his phantom predecessor Jack Griffin? This is a real rarity among sequels in that it is nearly as good as the original.  It's one of my favorites in this genre.  The story moves along briskly features some intriguing scenes and offers some occasional humor. The acting is solid.  The special effects though primitive by today's standards are still effective.  That doesn't mean it is without it share of faults.  Chief among them is why they didn't inject Radcliffe earlier instead of waiting till the day of his execution?  Or better yet inject Helen so she might solve the crime.  Speaking of solving the crime Radcliffe uncovers the real murderer's identity much too easily.  Still I would love to see Universal Studios remake this someday with a woman as the unseen protagonistfugitiveThandie Newton would be my choice.

Claude Rains played the character with such a supercilious air that it was hard to care when he lost it all.But in this wellwritten sequel the Invisible Man is a true hero. Geoffrey Radcliffe is a wealthy gentleman with class courage and a sense of humor. Someone has framed him for murder and with the help of his devoted girl friend and trustworthy company doctor he sets out to make things right.Vincent Price is perfect as Geoffrey. He gives this invisible man plenty of guts along with goodness humility and a wonderfully selfdeprecating sense of humor. When madness sets in of course Price can babble with the best of them. But this time around you care. This is a man who ran his business empire for the benefit of the workers a man who can tease his weeping girl friend about how lucky she is not to see his face.Ladylike and innocentlooking Nan Grey is a horror legend for her bit role as the waiflike streetwalker in Dracula's Daughter. Here she gets to play the same gentle sensitive type only warmer and more womanly. Watching Helen Manson sit up all night watching over her suffering love falling asleep in her chair and fainting at the sight of his disfiguring bandages you will fall in love with her yourself. It's easy to see why Geoffrey loves her enough to risk madness and death to be by her side and why the villain was willing to stoop to murder for her sake.Sir Cedrick Hardwicke is mostly remembered today for playing kindly kingly old gentlemen in epics like THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. But here he is a ruthless cold villain a murderer who fights for greed and gain. The attraction to lovely Helen is only hinted at just a glance here and a tender word there. But it gives just the right touch of depth and tragedy to an amazingly nuanced performance.Just as many critics feel Dracula's Daughter was a deeper film than Dracula so INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS may well be an improvement over the original classic.Long live Universal Horror!".

	schema:reviewBody "In general it seems that sequels seldom live up to the originals. There are just too many examples I can think of when this was the case. In addition sequels that take an entirely different approach to the original subject matter often are abysmal failures as well such as the wonderful VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED and it's incredibly awful and saccharine CHILDREN OF THE DAMNED. In light of this I was very pleasantly surprised to this see that this film while quite different from the fantastic original is still an exceptional film.Much of the reason for the film being so good was that the film was made by Universal Studios during a very productive period for their horror films. They just knew how to put the whole package together to make a dandy film. Additionally the cast really helped as well as Vincent Price mostly just his voice as he IS invisible through almost all the film Cedric Hartwicke Cecil Kellaway and many others worked together to quite nicely.

In addition sequels that take an entirely different approach to the original subject matter often are abysmal failures as well such as the wonderful VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED and it's incredibly awful and saccharine CHILDREN OF THE DAMNED. In light of this I was very pleasantly surprised to this see that this film while quite different from the fantastic original is still an exceptional film.Much of the reason for the film being so good was that the film was made by Universal Studios during a very productive period for their horror films. They just knew how to put the whole package together to make a dandy film. Additionally the cast really helped as well as Vincent Price mostly just his voice as he IS invisible through almost all the film Cedric Hartwicke Cecil Kellaway and many others worked together to quite nicely. The writing also is a big standout as the film COULD have easily been just another hack sequel.

	schema:reviewBody "THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS Universal 1940 directed by Joe May is what is indicated during the opening credits a sequel to THE INVISIBLE MAN by H.G. Wells capitalizes on the success of recent update sequels to old 1930s horror tales. Unlike the resurrections of the Frankenstein Monster in THE SON OF FRANKENSTEIN 1939 and later Dracula and a new revised Mummy all of whom have or would be resurrected from the dead through some supernatural means Claude Rains who originated the Invisible Man character in 1933 whose Jack Griffin was shot and killed by the police in the conclusion would not have the power to be brought back from the dead as his monstrous contemporaries had but to have an introduction to a new invisible man played with distinction by Vincent Price. This sequel however not essentially a horror film is a blend of science fiction and murder mysteryThrough the first few minutes of the story it is learned to the viewer through lines of dialog from the servants that a young man named Sir Geoffrey Radcliffe Vincent Price sentenced to death for the murder of his brother Michael is scheduled for execution by hanging at dawn for the crime for which he is innocent. His fiance Helen Manson Nan Grey appeals to Geoffrey's cousin Richard Cobb Sir Cedric Hardwicke to have the execution postponed in order to prove his innocence but there's nothing he can do. Later that night Geoffrey's friend Doctor Frank Griffin John Sutton brother to the late Jack Griffin who had experimented with chemicals that cause invisibility comes to the prison to pay his last respects to Sir Geoffrey hours before his death sentence is to be carried out. Some time later the guards discover that Sir Geoffrey has escaped and they are completely baffled as to how he had gotten by them without anyone seeing him. Discovering some clothing left behind in his cell it is Inspector Sampson Cecil Kellaway of Scotland Yard who realizes how this was done especially since he is very much familiar with the Jack Griffin case nine years previously which causes him to suspect the late scientist's younger brother Frank into having something to do with Geoffrey's escape. The next scene then focuses on the movement of bushes and trees in the woods with a suitcase full of clothes opening up by itself. Sir Geoffrey is now an invisible man thanks to Griffin for his discovery of a secret formula known as duocaine which would leave Geoffrey transparent and free to go about to learn the truth as to why he was framed and to clear his name by revealing the true murderer. But the problem is for Griffin to come up with an antidote to prevent Geoffrey from going insane and meeting the same fate as his brother.While not up to the wit and pace to THE INVISIBLE MAN THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS done have some added bonuses. It's quite obvious however to take notes and compare the original film with its sequel. The leading ladies in both films Gloria Stuart and Nan Grey are not only blondes but play fiances to the leading character. Claude Rains was virtually unknown to movie audiences when chosen to play the invisible man while Vincent Price has had some exposure in movies since his feature debut in 1938. The one thing both Rains and Price had in common while playing invisible men on screen was their individual distinctive voices. As with the earlier film the sequel takes time for some prank humor by the new invisible man as he stalks Willie Sphears Alan Napier a night watchman through the woods. It is believed that Mr. Sphears who had testified against him at his trial might be the sole witness to his brother's murder. At times amusing this sequence ends with some unpleasantness after Geoffrey takes the fainted Mr. Sphears ties his feet and arms behind him and leaving him alone in a room standing helplessly on a stool with his neck placed inside a hanged noose. Special effects compliments by John Fulton take precedence throughout the story with Geoffrey removing his goggles bandages and clothing only to reveal nothing underneath as well as one interesting highlight where the now wounded and cold Geoffrey is alone in the country talking to the scarecrow as he borrows its clothing for his own use.Forrester Harvey who appeared as Herbert Hall in THE INVISIBLE MAN returns in this sequel assuming another character role that of Ben Jenkins. What a welcome added attraction THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS would have been had Forrester Harvey and Una O'Connor reprized their original roles as the scared innkeepers encountering another invisible man. THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS would spawn two more sequels in the 1940s THE INVISIBLE AGENT 1942 and THE INVISIBLE MAN'S REVENGE 1944 each featuring Jon Hall playing descendants to Jack Griffin concluding in 1951 when another invisible man meets up with Abbott and Costello. In order not to forget the originator to THE INVISIBLE MAN a photo of Claude Rains would be evident as was in THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS. The overly familiar instrumental Frank Skinner underscoring used during the closing cast credits of this production would be heard in several other Universal productions of that period including THE SON OF FRANKENSTEIN THE TOWER OF London both 1939 and BLACK Friday 1940 all featuring Boris Karloff.THE INVISIBLE MAN RETURNS available on video cassette and then onto DVD and had played on several cable channels including the SciFi Channel in the 1990s and on American Movie Classics in 1991 and brought back on that channel again from 2000 to 2001.

	schema:reviewBody "In January of 1940 nearly seven years after the release of the first film a classic in every sense of the word it's sequel The Invisible Man Returns arrived this time he's played by an American actor  the late and great Vincent Price.In The Invisible Man Returns the dapper and refined 6 foot 5 actor portrays the invisible man with a fair degree of effectiveness though certainly not as spectacularly or as vividly as his British counterpart years earlier and the film as a whole is a handsomely staged bigbudget sequel that features a good cast and an even better crew backing them up. To put it one way when the invisible man returned so did the renowned specialeffects expert John P. Fulton whose indelible contributions greatly enhanced the distinctive visual style of The Invisible Man film series and several other early Universal classics. If only the director of this film was as talented as it's specialeffect guru but that's certainly not the case here. The first Invisible Man film benefited from the masterful direction of James Whale however this film was directed by a far less talented director Joe May a veteran German director of temperamental nature whose workmanlike sense of direction clearly doesn't produce the same levels of energy or enthusiasm. However if there's one aspect where this film is superior to the first film it would certainly be from a musical angle The Invisible Man Returns is blessed with one of the best efforts from the the renowned duo of Hans J. Salter and Frank Skinner who at the time were Universal Studio's goto team when a new horror score was needed. I'd also say that The Invisible Man Returns has the edge in terms of cinematography the sequel has a bit more spit and polish to it compared to the original resulting in an overall smoother visual presentation. You certainly can't fault this films camerawork it's beautifully shot from the opening frame to the last.However every time I see The Invisible Man Returns it leaves me with the same impression though it's a good sequel it's certainly not in the same league as the original. It's obviously lacking much of the verve and excitement that the first film has in spades. But why is that? First off lets start with the cast Vincent Price though visually more impressive at a towering 6'5 but the actors voice is definitely not the equal to that of Claude Rains maybe had he been 30 years older at the time that would have made the difference as his voice became much more distinctive with age. Secondly director Joe May simply lacked the distinctive flair for sly and witty or impish humor that James Whale was well known for. Thirdly the movies script required that the invisible man's actions to be held much more in check this time around because after all unlike in the original film in the sequel the invisible man is the good guy and as the rules stipulate the good guys can't be running around the countryside murdering and maiming. Those are three obvious reasons I could detect as to why this sequel fails to live up to the original  though there may be more. Even so there's still a lot to like about this classic film such as the invisibility effects which are every bit as good and in some cases even better than first film you get a few good hefty doses of those distinctively egomaniacal rantings and ravings a sideeffect of the invisibility drug there's the aforementioned musical brilliance then there's the humor aspect and though it's not as funny as one would hope it's certainly not devoid of humor as there are several funny moments seen throughout the film  people think they're seeing ghosts after all.And if the Invisible Man Returns doesn't move you relax because there were at least three other Invisible movies made shortly thereafter in the form of The Invisible Woman 1940 Invisible Agent 1942 and The Invisible Man's Revenge 1944. It's my opinion that none of those three are better than the first two films but they too have there moments and not surprisingly The Invisible Woman is the lightest and most whimsical of the lot having none of the demonic charm and vindictive fury that THE Invisible Man a.k.a. Claude Rains exudes.One last thing as of yet I still haven't heard a compelling answer as to why they changed the named of the drug from Monocaine to Duocaine. Personally I always preferred Monocaine simply because it sounds like the more dangerous of the two.".

Even so there's still a lot to like about this classic film such as the invisibility effects which are every bit as good and in some cases even better than first film you get a few good hefty doses of those distinctively egomaniacal rantings and ravings a sideeffect of the invisibility drug there's the aforementioned musical brilliance then there's the humor aspect and though it's not as funny as one would hope it's certainly not devoid of humor as there are several funny moments seen throughout the film  people think they're seeing ghosts after all.And if the Invisible Man Returns doesn't move you relax because there were at least three other Invisible movies made shortly thereafter in the form of The Invisible Woman 1940 Invisible Agent 1942 and The Invisible Man's Revenge 1944. It's my opinion that none of those three are better than the first two films but they too have there moments and not surprisingly The Invisible Woman is the lightest and most whimsical of the lot having none of the demonic charm and vindictive fury that THE Invisible Man a.k.a. Claude Rains exudes.One last thing as of yet I still haven't heard a compelling answer as to why they changed the named of the drug from Monocaine to Duocaine. Personally I always preferred Monocaine simply because it sounds like the more dangerous of the two.";

I couldn't take Price's invisible threats seriously and just laughed through most of his dialogue. And unfortunately he decides to ham it up when playing someone in the throes of going mad. His maniacal laughter is hilariously bad. As are his sudden outbursts to keep the dogs quiet early on in the film. I also found the foreman Alan Napier Spears unbelievable. Not in that his acting is to be faulted I quite enjoyed his performance but his accent is atrocious. That accent does not exist anywhere in the North of England or in Scotland or whatever he was trying to do. Shame he didn't just talk properly.Apart from the above silliness the film moves at a good pace. Some of the effects are good for example the Invisible man's outline being revealed when Police Inspector Cecil Kellaway blows cigar smoke in his direction. There is also an involving chase sequence when the invisible Price comes after his evil relative Cedric Hardwicke Cobb. The film keeps the attention and I think it won't disappoint those who are fans of this genre.".

His voice and delivery are almost on par with Rains as Price's character has to take on the burden of invisibility because he's been wrongly accused of murder.Price's slow descent into madness is fun to watchi.e. the dinner table scene when he's going on about how he can rule the world. I also enjoyed Cecil Kellaway as the Scotland Yard Agent especially some of his witty banter to some of the fumbling policemen we see throughout this picture.There's also a great exchange between 2 policemen who are talking about the Invisible One and the supernatural as one of them says I don't hold with no spiritualism. And the photographic effects by the great John P.

Hardwicke is more or less that character you can't seem to put your full trust in. In other minor roles are John Sutton Leyland Hodgson and Ivan Simpson.The special effects help this oldie keep its charm. My favorite scene is still when Grey faints after Price unravels his bandages. Still a hoot to watch.".

The photo of Claude Rains in this film occupied about as much screen time as his corpse did at the end of the first movie. Otherwise Rains was nowhere visible in the story. Similarly we only see Vincent Price at the very end of the movie when he's taken the antidote to make him corporeal once again.But the biggest kick I got out of the movie was when the helmeted police wearing gas masks and cloaks came on the scene to hunt down and capture the Invisible Man at Radcliffe Manor. It made me wonder if in fact they could have been the inspiration for Darth Vader. Ultimately the film is a fun part of the Invisible Man legacy leaving only one question in this viewer's mind coming out of the picture  Can an invisible hand leave visible fingerprints?".

His friend Dr. Frank Griffin John Sutton is the brother of the original Invisible Man and has been continuing his brother's research. Frank uses the invisibility formula to help Geoffrey escape prison so he can prove his innocence. But the side effects of the formula start to drive Geoffrey crazy just as they did Frank's brother years before.Great sequel to the Invisible Man doesn't match that film but it's very entertaining in its own right. Good cast good special effects solid story. Vincent Price's first foray into horror films. He's no Claude Rains in the part but he does well. John Sutton is likable if somewhat bland. Cedric Hardwicke is a slimy villain. Nice part for Alan Napier Alfred on the '60s Batman TV series as a crony of Hardwicke's. Pretty Nan Grey gets little to do but be worried. She looks great doing it though. Cecil Kellaway is excellent playing against type as the dogged police inspector on Radcliffe's trail.Universal had great luck with the sequels in their various monster series. I can't think of a single one that I would say is a bad movie not worth watching. This one is very good and restarts the Invisible franchise quite nicely. There would be three more Invisible movies to follow in the early '40s each very different but all enjoyable movies.".

The plot keeps things interesting as the sympathetic innocent man is slowly driven to madness that is beyond his control. Price although only appearing for less than a minute had yet to hone his acting craft but manages to carry the film using only that voice which is now so embedded in horror culture. It's not a patch on Whale's masterful original but The Invisible Man Returns is a worthy sequel remaining thoroughly entertaining throughout kickstarting one of many lucrative franchises for Universal Studios.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

The story deals with the conquest of the Inca empire now Per by the Spaniards leaded by Franncisco Pizarro back in the sixteenth century. This is not a movie for everyone to see it and appreciate it it could seem a bit slow at times but it stands as a fine and very decent product for those of us who are interested in historical events om Latin America.The Royal Hunt of the Sun can be considered as the delayed complement to Henry King's Captain from Castile 1947 referred to the similar conquest of today's Mexico by Hernn Corts played accurately by Csar Romero. The more than 20 years elapsed between both films shows clearly the different cinematographic techniques of one time and the other but both products have many similarities in their conception such as the crash between two completely different civilizations each one with their own religious social and political standards and also the search of gold and riches by both conquistadores and their total lack of scruples for the achievement of their target clearly leaving aside the pretended conversion to Catholicism of the natives that was the excuse of their kings to support the expeditions in a time when the church ruled in Spain.If not totally accurate with real facts the Pizarro saga and his confrontation with the godking Atahualpa in Royal Hunt is acceptable scripted and suits enough history and mainly legend.The atmosphere that not very prolific director Irving Lerner obtains in his film is excellent transiting a sort of a mystical sensation at times and when required the final sequence when the Incas are waiting for Atahualpa's Sunfather to raise and bring him back to life is outstanding. The location places settings and a weird music are very good too.Robert Shaw plays a convincing Pizarro daring ambitious and greedy who after a while shows some kind of respect and even admiration towards a man he can't quite understand. It is true that Cristopher Plummer's performance as Atahualpa is most eccentric as some reviewers state here but who knows how a God he and his people were convinced he was one would behave? I think that Plummer did a very good job with his role here and his truly original acting is one of the highlights of the film.For those who enjoy historical films with an epic frame this is one to see.".

He captured Incan Emperor Athahualpa and claimed the Peru lands for king Charles I of Spain. Here retracing Pizarro' career  his steps through Spain and Portugal  besides  it explores the particular relationship between captor Pizarro and captive Atahualpa.Based on a play by Peter Shaffer  it has a dramatic style with a lot of interior scenarios  but also displays some battle scenes and swordplay . Main cast gives nice acting such as Robert Shaw as the brave Pizarro and Christopher Plummer provides overacting as a strange Atahualpa who puts faces grimaces and says rare words and sounds  Plummer played Pizarro in 1965 OffBroadway . Support cast is frankly good such as Andrew Keir Michael Craig  James Donald  Percy Herbert  Leonard Whiting as Martin and special mention for Nigel Davenport as Hernando de Soto . The motion picture finely written by Philip Yordan was well directed by Irving Lerner who made some acceptable films as Cry battle Murder by contract  City of fear  Edge of fury . This was Lerner's fourth collaboration with writerproducer Philip Yordan in less than 10 years. Others three were Studs Lonigan  Captain Apache and A town called Bastard.The picture is based on historical events  Pizarro commands an expedition into the heart of the Inca Empire governed by Emperor Atahualpa  as he proceeded with his conquest accompanied by 200 men on 24 Sept 1532 . Following the defeat of his brother Huascar  Atahualpa arrived in Cajamarca on 15 november  there Pizarro had a force of just 110 foot soldiers 67 cavalry 3 arquebuses and 2 falconets . He sent Hernando Pizarro and De Soto to meet him in his camp . Athaulpa agreed to meet in his plaza fortress the next day . Fray Vicente Valverde and a native interpreter approached to him and Atahualpa said  I will be no man's tributary . There is a battle and the Spanish were successful . Francisco captures the Incan emperor  the god chief Atahualpa and promises to free him upon the delivery of a hoard of gold . Later on  Pizarro executed his 12man honor guard and taking the Inca captive at the socalled Ransom Room . Despite fullfilling his promise of filling one room with gold and two with silver  Atahualpa was convicted of 12 charges including killing his brother and plotting against Pizarro and his troops . He was executed by garrote on 29 August 1533. Francisco and De Soto were opposed to execution but Pizarro consented to the trial due to the great agitation among soldiers particularly by Almagro . After that  Pizarro advanced with his army of 500 Spaniards toward Cuzco that was conquered.Pizarro founded Lima in 1535 which he considered to be one of the most important things he had created in his life . A dispute ocurred between Pizarro and Almagro respecting the limits of Cuzco jurisdiction . This led to confrontations and Almagro was eventually defeated during the battle of Salinas . In Lima 1541 a group of 20 heavily armed of Diego Almagro the younger stormed Pizarro's palace assassinating him he painted a cross in his own blood and cried for Jesus Christ . Diego Almagro Jr was caught and executed the following year after losing the battle of Chupas .".

The motion picture finely written by Philip Yordan was well directed by Irving Lerner who made some acceptable films as Cry battle Murder by contract  City of fear  Edge of fury . This was Lerner's fourth collaboration with writerproducer Philip Yordan in less than 10 years. Others three were Studs Lonigan  Captain Apache and A town called Bastard.The picture is based on historical events  Pizarro commands an expedition into the heart of the Inca Empire governed by Emperor Atahualpa  as he proceeded with his conquest accompanied by 200 men on 24 Sept 1532 . Following the defeat of his brother Huascar  Atahualpa arrived in Cajamarca on 15 november  there Pizarro had a force of just 110 foot soldiers 67 cavalry 3 arquebuses and 2 falconets . He sent Hernando Pizarro and De Soto to meet him in his camp . Athaulpa agreed to meet in his plaza fortress the next day . Fray Vicente Valverde and a native interpreter approached to him and Atahualpa said  I will be no man's tributary . There is a battle and the Spanish were successful . Francisco captures the Incan emperor  the god chief Atahualpa and promises to free him upon the delivery of a hoard of gold . Later on  Pizarro executed his 12man honor guard and taking the Inca captive at the socalled Ransom Room . Despite fullfilling his promise of filling one room with gold and two with silver  Atahualpa was convicted of 12 charges including killing his brother and plotting against Pizarro and his troops . He was executed by garrote on 29 August 1533. Francisco and De Soto were opposed to execution but Pizarro consented to the trial due to the great agitation among soldiers particularly by Almagro . After that  Pizarro advanced with his army of 500 Spaniards toward Cuzco that was conquered.Pizarro founded Lima in 1535 which he considered to be one of the most important things he had created in his life . A dispute ocurred between Pizarro and Almagro respecting the limits of Cuzco jurisdiction . This led to confrontations and Almagro was eventually defeated during the battle of Salinas . In Lima 1541 a group of 20 heavily armed of Diego Almagro the younger stormed Pizarro's palace assassinating him he painted a cross in his own blood and cried for Jesus Christ . Diego Almagro Jr was caught and executed the following year after losing the battle of Chupas .";

	schema:reviewBody "This is really one of the best movies Ive ever watched in my life! Christopher Plummer is absolutely wonderful as Atahualpa nice accent convincing acting and Robert Shaw is a great Francisco Pizarro lots of emotion and passion. This movie is about a beautiful culture and empire being ruined within a very short time the Spanish conquistadors come to Peru in search of gold and to convert the natives. They find an extremely wellorganised empire with their own God Atahualpa. Its fascinating to watch Pizarro becoming more and more fond of Atahualpa and at the same time it becomes more and more difficult for Pizarro to decide about the Incas fate. This is of course not a very modern movie there are no visual or audio effects and at certain points the camera work isnt perfect a bit shaky for instance. However the story is great the dialogue is interesting and sometimes thoroughly moving and the actors are doing a terrific job! Full marks for The Royal Hunt Of The Sun and...sorry but I have to mention it...Plummer doesnt look bad in this movie...".

	schema:reviewBody "In the tradition of Becket comes The Royal Hunt Of The Sun a piece of important history reduced to a personal struggle between two men. Only these two Conquistador Francisco Pizarro and Emperor Atahualpa of the Incas have far more in common than they think.The Royal Hunt Of The Sun was a successful play on Broadway running for 261 performances written by Peter Shaffer. It won a Tony Award for young David Carradine playing Atahualpa. But in the film version Robert Shaw plays Pizarro and Christopher Plummer who was Pizarro on stage plays Atahualpa. I'm guessing that Plummer's Pizarro was a bit less rough around the edges than Shaw is in the film.He's certainly a fascinating Atahualpa who like the early emperors of the Roman Empire took divinity unto himself. The problem is that when you're supposed to be a god you have to occasionally do something really spectacular to prove your claim. That's what kind of undoes Plummer in the end.As for Pizarro he never claimed he was anything not even a gentleman. He was a soldier by profession an illegitimate kid who raised pigs as a young man and left to join the Spanish army of Emperor Charles V. Atahualpa was also born on the wrong side of the blanket and defeated his brother in a civil war for the Inca Empire. That's a most human act and Pizarro is quick to notice.He also is a shrewd judge of the Inca psychology. When in that famous event he tricks Atahualpa into captivity Pizarro realizes the empire built on a godhead emperor can't function without him. The Incas are paralyzed with the fact they're whole belief system is being put to the test and failing badly. Of course in theological discussions with Father Andrew Keir of the expedition Atahualpa's not doing too bad himself. But these are only academic exercises.This is not a faithful adaption. The whole scene at Charles V's court with James Donald as the Emperor is written for the screen. A whole lot of peripheral characters have been changed as well. Still the spirit of what author Shaffer was trying to say is realized.The Royal Hunt Of The Sun is both entertaining and intellectually stimulating.".

In hindsight I should've read the reviews because my frame of mind would've been in the right place to enjoy this intense character study. Suffice to say on second viewing I was able to appreciate the quality of the stageborn dialogue and the precision with which its delivered by both Shaw and Plummer in their unique portrayals of demigods by any other name.Narratively it's a detailed snapshot of Pizarro's illfated conquest of the Incas not for the glory of gold but for the almost sanctimonious obsession with divinity and unparalleled colonialism. In essence he signed his ticket before he departed Spain promising the world he could never deliver pursuing a pathological indulgence to satisfy his superior ego. There's an element of pity in Shaw's depiction of Pizarro that of a mercenary without a war unable to adjust to a civilian life. Shaw is magnificent as the deeply righteous conquistador whose eloquence in arguing secular sovereignty fails to dominate the simple native lexicon of King Atahualpa Plummer communicating in a basically nonsensical series of clicks and chirps. If Atahualpa can prove he is a God Pizarro will recognise his sovereignty but if not both his life and his land of rich antiquities will belong to the kingdom of Spain.With Michael Craig Leonard Whiting and Nigel Davenport in the wings it's an ensemble British cast of true quality and the performances are first rate. Set design costumes score and script deliver and while momentum is at times a distinct challenge if you're not fully engaged in the dialogue the result is likely to be languid in pace and voluble in speak. My initial viewing was such fortunately I watched it a second time.".

This movie retells this sad chapter of history very well and very accurately.";

Atahualpa king of the American equivalent of the Roman Empire inheritor of 2000 years of sophisticated cultural history looked and sounded like a chimpanzee trying to speak German. Lack of respect? Failure to take the trouble to find a proper tutor for the few lines Plummer had to speak of Quechua? Who knows. But it was hard for the audience  or me  to take the movie seriously after that scene. I saw the movie again 10 or 15 years later and couldn't help laughing all over again... and explaining to my family why it was so hilarious.".

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Shaffer's play receives a spotty film treatment in this talky drama. At first glance the film seems to suggest that it will be an epic but inescapably based on the source it is a drama and a rather static one at that.  What may have been interesting and riveting on the stage or maybe not! is oppressively constricted here.  A huge portion of the film takes place in a stone room.  Shaw is famed Spanish explorer Pizarro headed to Peru to capture gold for himself and his country.  None of the voyage is shown.  He is accompanied by Davenport as DeSoto Craig Whiting two priests and a band of armed men.  They come upon a Peruvian God and hold him hostage for gold after slaughtering all of his followers who were present at the time.  This part is portrayed by Plummer in a very controversial performance.  His exceedingly unique and dedicated performance is either hailed as brilliant or dismissed as bizarre and indulgent.  It is certainly unusual in either case.  He flits around half naked displaying a startlingly fit body for a 42yearold man four years AFTER Captain Von Trapp! with feathered headdress long fingernails and a long black wig.  He looks a tad like Rita Coolidge or Grace Slick.  His speech is almost unintelligible and is very birdlike and singsong like East Indians speak. Catch the scene in which he first encounters a Bible and uses all five senses to understand it.  He stares at it smells it feels it licks it puts his ear to it and eventually tosses it away!  There is an epic feel at times but not an epic budget.  Only one real battle scene occurs and it is effective to a degree even though the scoring is completely bizarre!  The music in this film is all unusual.  A soloist is featured occasionally who has a voice like a tea kettle about to explode.  History buffs may want to give it a look and fans of Shaw should enjoy seeing him in a featured role. It's a rare chance to see Whiting before he fell off the radar and everyone needs to at least glimpse Plummer in his get up if only to recognize how versatile the man is!  Most viewers are going to be bored stiff by it.".

I originally saw the film because of Leonard Whiting Romeo in the Franco Zefferelli film Romeo and Juliet opposite Olivia Hussey as Juliet who plays a young member of Pizarro's party. Plummer was able to accurately capture the essence of the Incan leader with great pride and dignity despite his fatal flaw of trusting the representative of a culture whose only goal was domination and oppression. This story was also brilliantly presented in the Newberry Awardwinning children's novel The Secret of the Andes by Ann Nolan Clark about a young boy who is the last remaining pure Incan living in the Andes with his spiritual guide and teacher who goes on a journey of discovery into Cuzco to find out what contributed to the eradication of his race. Unfortunately I have been unable to find this film to either rent or buy but if you are able to obtain a copy it is well worth watching. The title of the film is tied to the Incans' worship of the sun their monetary unit is the sol which is sun in Spanish.".

The one in Royal Hunt of the Sun is so many hundreds of years old and yet is made so tough that one instance sees three men successfully carry a large cannon over it but one other soldier on his own puts a foot through one of the boards and nearly falls to his death. But I digress from the more burning more taxing issues and ideas apparent in Royal Hunt of the Sun. It would be true to say that everyone's favourite action orientated mythical adventure genre clich in the rope bridge is out in force in the 1969 Irving Lerner film but there's an underlying current of study included with most of what goes on during the early segments. Such an opening sounds disjointed leaping from arbitrary rope bridge conversation to the mentioning of deeper ideas but such is the manner of this opening as is of the film in question. The film essentially cut into two parts and parted right down the middle by a maddening and somewhat misguided slow motion sword fight sequence to some high tempo Spanish flamenco music ends on a deeply disturbing and rather philosophical note when a man's word a bond between men a truce between men and whether the coexisting of religions from different nations and cultures are possible. Most characters came in search of gold they did not have but one man the leader found something else which was inside of him the entire time. Robert Shaw plays that man a truetolife Spanish explorer by the name of Francisco Pizarro whom journeys to South America once again in search of a trove of gold in some form. Prior to embarking Pizarro stands in front of his peers and their subjects goading them as idle persons standing by waiting for the nation of Spain to sink into some sort of ruin.

Pizarro's wish in granted once again by the higherups that are present for another romp in search of indescribable treasures but they maintain he is a mere adventurer nothing more.Pizarro's inability to properly connect with those in a long spindly location of royal dwelling in his native Spain as those at the top sit at one end and those summoned stand at the other is raised later on when whilst in the presence of the leader of the natives of the land he has arrived at Christopher Plummer's walking Inca God Atahualpa a level of communication is reached a sense of understanding is accomplished  here is a man who dares to dream in equal manner whose eccentricity twinned with his habit to think outside of the proverbial box matches Pizarro's. Their overall dress and look may be of clear binary opposition in their clothes and hair but the understanding they have binds them something exemplified through items such as their sharing of illiteracy. It is a connection that will be pushed pretty far when an agreement to do with preserving one's life in exchange for something else which in turn ought to guarantee the preserving of someone else's is used as a drive for a final third potboiler.Royal Hunt of the Sun is initially a romping sweeping adventure flick running on a drive to do with the search for something that might not even exist and has not been found on manya past occasion by the same individual who has cost manya life in the process. Armed with religion in the form of a priest convinced all those who have not taken to the bible and its readings are yet to be truly fulfilled in their life a young Paige by the name of Martin Whiting and Pizarro's own razor sharp tongue and wit they take it upon themselves to finally uncover the legend of the gold in finding it. Bearing in mind it is a full three years prior to Herzog's Aguirre The Wrath of God a film similar in premise Royal Hunt of the Sun cannot be denied its sense of historical context and additional inspiration. The first half enjoys its wide establishing shots of the dry wilderness the Spaniards must conquer as it does its unnerving confrontations with the local Inca tribesmen which are rendered quick witted pulpy hillside sequences of fastpaced banter rebounding between talk of religion and the whereabouts of the riches.Following that bizarre centrefold fight sequence in which the Spanish have their religion rejected and many Inca tribespeople are massacred Royal Hunt of the Sun beds down into a two locale maximum piece really starting to show its stage roots but offering a little more than singular strand adventure fable in which rope bridges and nervy interactions with the native locals are the order of the day. The shift sees the film change gears and opt for content of a different kind of dramatic nature which isn't of an overly visual sort instead relying on conflicts to do with a man's bond versus another's wellbeing a man's thoughts and ideas conflicting with that of the state's evident when Pizarro attempts to reject the conquistadors that are his own in favour of the Inca leader. This plus a conflict of interests in religion whether this South American band of people even need the western world's thoughts and musings on all things holy which is rendered a form of modernity in the travelling priest whose aim it seems is to transfer knowledge. The film works and although its seams are a little more obvious than I would've liked its shifting of content of a dramatic weight makes for interesting and somewhat engrossing viewing.".

This film also known as The Devil's Commandment was the first Italian made horror film of the sound era and inspired a wave of Gothic Italian horror films .

The movie belongs to Italian Horror genre  Riccardo Freda Secret of Dr. Hitchcock  Il Vampiri along with Mario Bava Planet of vampires House of exorcism are the fundamental creators . In fact  both of whom collaborated deeply among them  as Bava finished two Fedra's films  this Il Vampiri and Caltiki .

Later on  there appears Dario Argento Deep red SuspiriaInferno another essential filmmaker of classic Latino terror films . The vampires packs a good acting from Gianna Maria Canale  directer's wife  as a crazed duchess obsessed with retaining her youth. There also appears a cameo director  Riccardo Freda as autopsy doctor . The movie has a splendid cinematography by the terror genius  Mario Bava  while working with Freda on The vampires 1956  the director left the project after an argument with the producers and the film mostly unfinished  then Bava stepped in and directed the majority of the movie finishing it on schedule. The motion picture was well directed by Riccardo Freda who used a number of aliases during his career including Robert Hampton or George Lincoln and as screenwriter Riccardo Fedra . His artistic spirit led him to a strong belief in the importance of visual composition in filmmaking . Freda worked in many popular genres including viking films Peplum spaghetti westerns action and even Softcore but it is his horror films and Giallo mystery films which stand out and for which he is best remembered . Freda along with Vittorio Cottafavi continued to realize films in the historicalspectacular style  at which he developed a considerable skill and mastery . From the mid50s Freda's liking make for atmospheric and colorful scenes of shock began to itself apparent  especially in such Musclemen epics as Teodora  Spartacus  Giants of Thessaly  The seventh sword  Maciste all's inferno  the latter a grippinghorror Peplum and of course Maciste in the court of the Great Khan one of his best films . In the early 60s  he was a pioneer in Italy of horrorfantasy films frightening audiences the world over  especially with I Vampiri and L'Orrible Segreto del Doctor Hitchcock as he combined with that widestaring of actress  the Britishborn Barbara Steele . He also made adventures as Black Eagle  The son of Black Eagle  White devil  Son of D'Artagnan  and uncredited Daughter of D'Artagnan . From there he went to melodrama and spy films as Mexican Slayrideand Coplan FX18 and even made some western as No killing without dollars with Mark Damon and signed under pseudonym as George Lincoln . Freda's movies had popular appeal  and were usually commercial hits . Several were FrenchSpanishItalian or other European coproductions . He has been called a filmmaker who brings some style to exploitation pictures and has something of a cult following . Rating  7  better than average horror movie .".

The movie literally gets gobbled up by the Gothic atmosphere of the castle with its incredible gargoyles elaborately Gothic crypt secret passages baroque cobwebs pillars marked with demonic images and a Sleeping Beauty tangle of vines on the grounds. The reliance on scenery alone to communicate a descent into a sadistic unconscious reminds one of Cocteaus Beauty and the Beast though the strategy was tried too in 40s Hollywood.

	schema:headline " I VAMPIRI Riccardo Freda and uncredited Mario Bava 1957 ";
	schema:reviewBody "This is notable for being the first Italian horror film thus spearheading a rich Gothic vein which ran well into the 1970s one of three strands of horror which emerged simultaneously  the others being the socalled MexiHorror and Britain's Hammer brandname. Curiously enough I had never heard of the film when it turned up on latenight Italian TV some years ago but loved it immediately and having erased the tape I'd been pondering the idea of picking up the Image DVD ever since its release  but only now with Anchor Bay's recent issue of THE MARIO BAVA COLLECTION VOL. 1 Box Set did I determine to spring for it! Rewatching I VAMPIRI now and having in the meantime amassed quite a few titles made in this style I can safely say that it was a tremendous start to the subgenre and remains one of its finest examples.Due to a dispute with the producers Freda left the project after 10 days' shooting Bava eventually completed the film and during the remaining 2 day's work reportedly made considerable changes to its plot structure which should have allotted him a codirector credit  a similar situation subsequently arose during the making of the horrorscifi CALTIKI THE IMMORTAL MONSTER 1959. Bava's cinematography lends the film a real class  transcending its obvious lowbudget and tight schedule  with any number of sweeping camera moves to take advantage of the Cinemascope format and incredible lighting effects. Besides the transformation of the villainess from a beautiful woman into an old hag are masterfully accomplished incamera through the use of filters pretty much in the style of DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE 1931. The sets especially the elaborate castle interior are suitably impressive Roman Vlad's powerful score may have been reused in later films as it felt oddly familiar to me.The script does seem to naively approach the new genre by piling on typical elements from the American horror films such as the mad scientist and his sinisterlooking 'zombie' acolyte. However there's no real vampire at work here  but rather rejuvenation by blood transfusion perhaps it was thought that the traditional bloodsucker would seem incongruous  or worse laughable  amidst a modernday Parisian backdrop but this clash of settings actually works very nicely and may well have influenced EYES WITHOUT A FACE 1959 which in its way proved even more seminal to the horror genre. Besides we get an unusual emphasis on the antagonistic rapport between the reporter hero and the police inspector in charge of the crime spree following a splendid climax the latter provides a longwinded lastminute explanation for the benefit of the viewer  which basically became a fixture of Italian horrorthriller efforts.It's also interesting that the hero ultimately establishes the source of evil as being much closer to home than he could ever have imagined in fact he represents the object of desire for wicked noblewoman Gianna Maria Canale probably cast because she was Freda's lover at the time but there's no denying that her classical looks and natural sophistication are perfect for the role. Still even if the reporter falls for a lovely ingnue and does bear a grudge against Canale his aggressive aversion to the latter isn't credible he should have been fascinated by her in spite of himself thus creating an inner conflict for the hero. As it stands one is merely moved to see Canale cling pathetically to an unrequited love  for which she debases herself by being driven to crime in order to reobtain a semblance of youth a scheme which still backfires on her as the effect only lasts for short periods of time!The latter drawback leads incidentally to a headscratching scene towards the end of the film Canale runs into the hero who accompanies her to buy a painting  she starts reverting to her true decrepit age while writing a cheque excuses herself and hurries away to 'safety'. This somehow arouses the reporter's suspicion why he should care whether she is right or lefthanded is beyond me but her behavior appears odd even to the shopowner and he promptly phones a colleague who had accompanied him the night before to a party given at the castle  the latter smitten with the lady had stayed behind  and consequently discovers that his friend has vanished! EuroCult favorite Paul Muller's haunted hunted look makes him ideal for the role of the hapless junkie who's basically blackmailed into complying with the doctor and the Duchess's perverse experiment. Curiously enough Freda had originally intended him to be guillotined and subsequently reassembled this grisly end however was dropped when Bava took over  but the stitching marks on his neck are said to be still visible in a scene where the reanimated Muller is grilled by Police still not being aware of his altered fate beforehand I can't say that I noticed!Interestingly I VAMPIRI fared poorly at the boxoffice this has been attributed to the Italian people's innate skepticism of a homegrown horror product thus giving rise to the longrunning  and often highly amusing  practice of bestowing cast and crew members with Englishsounding names! With respect to the American market then the film was bafflingly retitled THE DEVIL'S COMMANDMENT and included additional scenes featuring Al Lewis later of the horrorspoof TV series THE MUNSTERS!!".

I've read a few whiny 'goth' teenagers complaining about the film's lack of 'real vampiric moments.' What idiots! An aging scientist keeps the Duchess Du Grand young although she can't stand his touch. To acquire young women needed for his serum he keeps a junkie locked up and strung out. Meanwhile the Duchess is in love with Pierre a young reporter investigating a series of mysterious murders in which young women are being drained of their blood. Ah love... The mood of the film perfectly balances neorealism with fantasy to create an expressionist fairy tale. The antagonistic relationship between the reporter and the police investigator and the abovementioned junkie make this an influence on the giallo as well as the revival of gothic horror in Italy. Ignore DVD Idiot Savant and the Ann Rice geeks. The rediscovery of this movie ranks up there with Whale's Old Dark House. It is an absolute classic and the print is excellent!".

	schema:headline " The Haunting and Supremely Elegant Birth of Gothic Horror made in Italy";
	schema:reviewBody "As far as I am concerned Mario Bava is simply THE greatest Horror director who ever lived and there are several reasons why. No other director has ever been capable of creating a haunting yet beautiful dreamlike atmosphere in the brilliant manner that Bava was there is no other Horror director whose repertoire includes the most genuine masterpieces. The supreme master of Gothic Horror and undisputed inventor or the Ialian Giallo Bava singlehandedly launched the Italian Horror boom which resulted in Italy becoming the undisputed country Nr.1 in the Horror world. Italian Horror cinema found real international recognition after Bava's incomparable Gothic masterpiece La Maschera Del Demoni aka. Black Sunday probably my choice for THE greatest Horror film of alltime. However the milestone that launched the raise of Horror made in Italy in 1956 is this stylish and extremely elegant gem I Vampiri. Horror films had been banned in Italy by the Fascist regime and it was not until the mid fifties that this ban was withdrawn. The first postWW2 Italian Horror film was directed by Riccardo Freda another more than great director Mario Bava was the cinematographer. When director Freda backed out from the project because he couldn't finish it in time Bava jumped in and finished the film even though he remained uncredited as a director. And what an accomplishment it is! The plot does not really revolve around traditional vampires as they would appear in other contemporary Horror milestones such as the British Hammer classic Dracula of 1958. This film has another morbid formula that would become one of the most popular themes in European Gothic Horror of the early 60s. A murderer is on the loose in Paris and since the bodies of his young female victims lack even a drop of blood in their bodies he has been nicknamed 'The Vampire'.  I shall not give away more of the plot only that it mixes elements of mad science with the supernatural. The story is wonderfully morbid and suspenseful however it is arguably the cinematographic style that is the most pioneering element of this great film. The budget was actually quite low but Bava's brilliant sense for lighting and especially for the dark as well as incredibly uncanny settings create the beautifully eerie atmosphere that we so love in Bava's later films. Especially the wonderfully dark castle is a haunting and beautiful setting for such a fascinating story. The performances are also very good the greatest coming from director Riccardo Freda's wife Gianna Maria Carnale in a mysterious role. Prolific EurohorrorExploitation Paul Muller began his streak of demented characters with this milestone. Overall I Vampiri is not Bava's best Gothic Horror film  La Maschera Del Demonio is without doubt and other masterpieces such as Operazione Paura aka. Kill Baby Kill 1966 I Tre Volti Della Paura aka. Black Sabbath 1963 or La Frusta E Il Corpo aka. The Whip And The Body 1963 also easily surpass it. However it was this milestone that started Italian Horror. And what an elegant haunting and fascinating milestone it is! An absolute must for every Bava fan Horrorbuff or lover of great cinema in general!".

He was initially hired as a cinematographer to work with director Riccardo Freda but when this latter couldn't keep up with the hasty filming schedule Bava took over and completed the film within the preconceived deadline. The result is a haunting Gothic mysterytale with a deliciously ingenious script and a wonderfully sinister atmosphere. Don't let the title mislead you too much as the film doesn't revolve on the typical bloodsucking creatures as you know them but on an entirely different kind of macabre characters. The city of Paris is under the spell of a relentless killer who at least murdered 4 young girls in the short period of only a couple of days time. Since the bodies don't have a single drop of blood left in them when they are discovered the press cleverly nicknamed the killer as the Vampire. The ambitious and womanizing journalist Pierre is so obsessed with the events that he starts an investigation himself. He discovers tracks that lead him to the castle of the eminent Du Grand family more particularly the gorgeous young duchess Giselle who has a severe crush on Pierre.The sudden twist halfway through the story is typically Gothic but that's just an extra reason for the fans to love it even more. Especially praiseworthy is the enormous amount of intrigue tension and morbidity featuring in the screenplay. Many gimmicks in I Vampiri are dared and definitely ahead of their time but also very credible at the same time the manipulation of a weak junkie the extraordinary vain lifestyle of the duchess.... This actually is a very lowbudgeted production but Mario Bava terrifically camouflages this with his elegant filmingstyle and skilled knowledge of lighting. The acting of the entire cast is far above average and especially Gianna Maria Canala spouse of director Riccardo Freda makes a big impression. The amount of gore is secondary to the atmosphere of course but still there are a couple of uniquely grim images of decomposing corpses to 'enjoy'. I am aware that some critics bash this film for it's supposable 'lack of vampireaction' but it's their stupid loss that they're unable to see the marvelous Gothic influences. I Vampiri is a great film that urgently requires more recognition.".

As we come to find out she is the 4th in a string of recent killings of young women. The killer has been branded The Vampire by the police and the press as there appears to be puncture wounds on the dead girls bodies needle marks. Enter the young newspaper reporter looking for a clues to get the story of the century who is always one step ahead of the police but always appearing to cry wolf when he asks for their assistance.The movie goes through several red herrings as it has you to believe that it's one person or another that is doing it however if you've seen enough horrorthrillers and mystery movies you will know that they are obviously the pawns for something greater. You will more than likely figure out what is going on after the first half of the movie however the way the film is set up and the story is delivered you will not care.One part horror one part mysterythriller I Vampiri is a solid 50's film. Some things of note the effects that are used to show the CountessGiselle are well done. You actually get the since of her aging right in front of your eyes. Also the sets are very nice to look at from it's big aboding castle to cemetery sequences shades of Bava's future film Black Sunday all things are of a high standard here.Despite all the positive's the movie in its own right may be a little too by the numbers. Though I enjoyed it and would recommend at least a rental of this film it really does not break any new ground which some will find a bit disappointing. I on the other hand liked this film and think that fans of Bava and old mysterythrillers will have a good time with this one. My score for I Vampiri 610 above average. Yes you may have seen this kind of thing before but with above average production values among other things this is a highly recommended rental and for fans of this sub genre a purchase. Just another reason why Bava is so revered by the HorrorThriller community.Until next time when dating a girl know matter how young she looks ask her age she may be essence stealing grandmother super freak...GM Out!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Italian cinema goers long held an aversion to horror films and thirtyseven years were to elapse between the silent 'Frankenstein's Monster' of 1920 and this film of Riccardo Freda. It's production problems have been well documented. Considering its miniscular budget ludicrously short filming schedule and the late exit of its director the end result is not at all bad. The films cinematographer Mario Bava stepped up to the plate and it is indeed notable for its visual style. The ballroom scene is especially impressive and the production design by Beni Montrasor evokes a feel of Edgar Allan Poe. Budget dictated that the period be updated to the midtwentieth century but this actually works in the films favour. Although they remained married until his death this was to be the last film in which Gianna Maria Canale appeared for Freda. At a height of 5' 8'' this ravishing ravenhaired greeneyed former Miss Florence is just right as Giselle du Grand who relies on the blood of others to maintain eternal youth. Unfortunately for her the effects do not last long and she begins to show her true age at the most inopportune moments! Scientist Julien who attempts to perfect the process is played by Antoine Balpetre. Her supply requires regular topping up and one of the reluctant 'donors' is lovely Wandisa Guida whose career alas did not amount to much. The weak links in the film are Carlo d'Angelo as the policeman and Dario Michaelis whose role as the journalist has been enlarged by Bava. They are distinctly mediocre and the screen empties when they appear. One would like to think that La Canale's husky voice is her own but thanks to the ineffable mysteries of Italian postsynchronisation most of the cast is dubbed.Although far from being classic horror it is very watchable and is obviously of interest in relation to where it stands in the history of the genre. The character of Giselle is no doubt inspired by the legendary Elisabeth Bathory whose best personification is that of Delphine Seyrig in 'Daughters of Darkness'. Mario Bava went on of course to direct the stylish 'Mask of Satan' better known as 'Black Sunday'. 'I vampiri' cannot be said to have popularised the genre and it is apparently the Hammer production 'Dracula' to which this dubious honour belongs. Terence Fisher's film introduces the concept of vampirism as somehow being sexy and glamorous rather than the pestilential curse it really is.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found out through painstaking research reading it on the internet that this is the first Italian horror film of the sound era and that director Freda walked off set and left Mario Bava to finish the film. A bunch of girls have turned up dead throughout town with all their blood drained from them. The cops are baffled but a young plucky happy go lucky jerk journalist is out to make a name for himself and catch the killer. He keeps being hit on by a young Duchess as their families are historically linked somehow but he's not interested his mate is though. Little does the guy know that the killings are somehow linked to the Duchess's castle and it's all going to come to a head.Actually the film starts of kind of like a giallo. The victims are killed in a strange way that leaves the police baffled. There's a few suspects that leads to the actual culprit who is a mystery to the viewer. There's even a bit of sleuthing on the part of the journalist. Things then slide into gothic horror territory what with the creepy castle with the mood lighting and secret passages. This is a very good looking film thanks to Bava who even at this early stage seems to be a master of visual composition and lighting. I don't know who did the 'aging' effects either but it's the true standout of this film and had me wondering how they hell they managed to do that back in the fifties. Other than that it did strike me as a little dull. A good looking little dull film with some good special effects that was first out of the gate. This is a dull review too. Some people love it though so don't listen to me.Paul Muller was good in it as the junky guy though and at the age of ninetyfive he still walks this Earth. Unless he died years ago and someone in his family is claiming his pension.".

He keeps being hit on by a young Duchess as their families are historically linked somehow but he's not interested his mate is though. Little does the guy know that the killings are somehow linked to the Duchess's castle and it's all going to come to a head.Actually the film starts of kind of like a giallo. The victims are killed in a strange way that leaves the police baffled. There's a few suspects that leads to the actual culprit who is a mystery to the viewer. There's even a bit of sleuthing on the part of the journalist. Things then slide into gothic horror territory what with the creepy castle with the mood lighting and secret passages. This is a very good looking film thanks to Bava who even at this early stage seems to be a master of visual composition and lighting. I don't know who did the 'aging' effects either but it's the true standout of this film and had me wondering how they hell they managed to do that back in the fifties. Other than that it did strike me as a little dull. A good looking little dull film with some good special effects that was first out of the gate. This is a dull review too. Some people love it though so don't listen to me.Paul Muller was good in it as the junky guy though and at the age of ninetyfive he still walks this Earth. Unless he died years ago and someone in his family is claiming his pension.";

	schema:headline " Mouthwatering Gothic horror debut from the great Mario Bava";
	schema:reviewBody "The historical context surrounding I Vampiri is undoubtedly more praiseworthy than the actual film but this collaboration between two of Italy's top directors Mario Bava and Riccardo Freda is an excellent slice of Gothic horror. I Vampiri is often credited as being the film that kicked off Italian horror cinema and it also provided the first directorial credit for Mario Bava a household name for anyone that loves their cult films. Bava apparently stepped in to shoot this film after it began to overrun its schedule but it seems obvious that Bava was the main man in charge as his trademarks are all over it. The great director is most famous for his gorgeous cinematography so it will come as no surprise that the film looks fantastic and that along with Bava's use of lighting and general ingenuity where special effects are concerned help to mask the low budget and rushed production schedule. The plot follows the discovery of a series of bodies that are found completely drained of blood. The bodies have been drained by a mad scientist who uses them to keep an aging duchess looking youthful.The plot takes obvious influence from classic horror stories such as the tale of Elizabeth Bathory and this is excellently complimented by the thick and foreboding Gothic atmosphere. Despite having the word 'Vampiri' in its title the film doesn't feature any bloodsucking or shape shifting and that is most likely the reason why the film was such a commercial failure in its homeland. The fact that the title doesn't really fit is of no concern to me however as the plot that does exist more than adequately makes up for it and while the productions problems are evident in the way that the plot moves sluggishly at times and the characters aren't too interesting there is always more than enough to keep horror fanatics interested. The standout sequence sees the duchess at the centre of the tale age before our eyes. Bava recycled this technique from earlier films such as Rouben Mamoulian's masterpiece adaptation of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and that sequence really shows the director's ingenuity. The central location is an old Gothic castle and by keeping the action centred on it Bava creates just the right atmospheric tone for the film. Overall I can't say that this film completely lives up to it's billing as one of the most important horror films ever but it's place in history is assured and it's a nice film to boot.".

	schema:headline " Mario Gets His Feet Wet";
	schema:reviewBody "Besides being marvelously entertaining 1956's I Vampiri is also an historically important film and for two reasons. First it was the very first Italian horror film of the sound era I have never been able to precisely ascertain WHY the Fascists saw fit to put a ban on this type of entertainment in the 1930s but the effects of the clampdown were farreaching indeed. And second and perhaps just as historic it was the film that saw the first bits of direction from the great Mario Bava a longtime director of photography and special effects technician who as the story goes filled in for director Riccardo Freda shooting half the film in the final two days of its allotted 12day production schedule! Freda was apparently quite pleased with his 42yearold DOP's first attempt in the director's chair as he gave Bava another chance to pinchhit for him three years later in the exciting horror film Caltiki the Immortal Monster an Italian variant of The Blob which had been released the year before. Bava's first go as the official director of a film came the following year with 1960's Black Friday one of the eternal glories of Italian horrorheck of horror cinema as a wholeand the rest as they say is history. Anyway I labored under two misconceptions before finally sitting down to watch I Vampiri recently. In my ignorance I had long thought that its title translated to I Vampire whereas of course it translates to The Vampires. My other incorrect assumption may perhaps be more easily excused I had always thought that the picture dealt with your average caped and coffininhabiting neck noshers whereas the vampires on display here are decidedly of a different ilk.In the film which transpires in modernday Paris and not Italia another expectation dashed! four young women have been found dead and exsanguinated over a sixmonth period. When the latest of the Vampire Killer's victims is fished out of the Seine hunkydude reporter Pierre Lantin played by Dario Michaelis redoubles his efforts to track down the fiend. He is hampered in those efforts by the persistent and unwanted attentions of the beautiful Giselle du Grand exquisitely played by Gianna Maria Canale niece of the mysterious elderly and veiled recluse the Duchess du Grand who inhabits the local castle. By employing some oldfashioned detective workand while irritating to distraction the police officer on the case Insp. Chantal Carlo D'AngeloLantin is able to track his bloodsucker down...only to find that it is like nothing he'd been expecting....Fast moving and intelligently scripted more startling than scary I Vampiri dishes out some truly genuine surprises. For this viewer the dawning realization as to the vampire's true nature came around 23 of the way in right before the big reveal and it really is a doozy I must say. Most impressively the transformation of the vampire from something seemingly normal into something more shocking I am trying valiantly not to be guilty of spoilers here is accomplished with no stopmotion photography or other tricks of the cinematic trade a wig a change of vocal timbre and a flash of decayed teeth do the job quite nicely. Some very effective work here by Freda and Bava and I might add that the acting in the film is quite fine too down to the smallest bit parts. The film mixes in Gothic elements which would be a mainstay of Italian horror cinema in the early to mid'60s with more modern styles and Bava's lensing of the duchess' palace with its moldering crypt exquisite ballroom and shadowy passageways is a thing of great and dismal beauty prefiguring his work in Black Sunday. Shot in BW and CinemaScope the film looks just fantastic with Bava proving yet again what a master he was at employing light and shadow. How impressive the film must have looked on the cinema screen back when and how surprising the fact that the picture was NOT an instant success! One odd note here the score by Roman Vlad which especially during the action sequences almost sounds more suitable for a Flash Gordon scifi serial.

Freda after this film would go on to direct not only Caltiki but two pictures starring the socalled Queen of Horror Barbara Steele The Horrible Dr. Hichcock and The Ghost.

	onyx:emotionText "Besides being marvelously entertaining 1956's I Vampiri is also an historically important film and for two reasons. First it was the very first Italian horror film of the sound era I have never been able to precisely ascertain WHY the Fascists saw fit to put a ban on this type of entertainment in the 1930s but the effects of the clampdown were farreaching indeed. And second and perhaps just as historic it was the film that saw the first bits of direction from the great Mario Bava a longtime director of photography and special effects technician who as the story goes filled in for director Riccardo Freda shooting half the film in the final two days of its allotted 12day production schedule! Freda was apparently quite pleased with his 42yearold DOP's first attempt in the director's chair as he gave Bava another chance to pinchhit for him three years later in the exciting horror film Caltiki the Immortal Monster an Italian variant of The Blob which had been released the year before. Bava's first go as the official director of a film came the following year with 1960's Black Friday one of the eternal glories of Italian horrorheck of horror cinema as a wholeand the rest as they say is history. Anyway I labored under two misconceptions before finally sitting down to watch I Vampiri recently. In my ignorance I had long thought that its title translated to I Vampire whereas of course it translates to The Vampires. My other incorrect assumption may perhaps be more easily excused I had always thought that the picture dealt with your average caped and coffininhabiting neck noshers whereas the vampires on display here are decidedly of a different ilk.In the film which transpires in modernday Paris and not Italia another expectation dashed! four young women have been found dead and exsanguinated over a sixmonth period. When the latest of the Vampire Killer's victims is fished out of the Seine hunkydude reporter Pierre Lantin played by Dario Michaelis redoubles his efforts to track down the fiend. He is hampered in those efforts by the persistent and unwanted attentions of the beautiful Giselle du Grand exquisitely played by Gianna Maria Canale niece of the mysterious elderly and veiled recluse the Duchess du Grand who inhabits the local castle. By employing some oldfashioned detective workand while irritating to distraction the police officer on the case Insp. Chantal Carlo D'AngeloLantin is able to track his bloodsucker down...only to find that it is like nothing he'd been expecting....Fast moving and intelligently scripted more startling than scary I Vampiri dishes out some truly genuine surprises. For this viewer the dawning realization as to the vampire's true nature came around 23 of the way in right before the big reveal and it really is a doozy I must say. Most impressively the transformation of the vampire from something seemingly normal into something more shocking I am trying valiantly not to be guilty of spoilers here is accomplished with no stopmotion photography or other tricks of the cinematic trade a wig a change of vocal timbre and a flash of decayed teeth do the job quite nicely. Some very effective work here by Freda and Bava and I might add that the acting in the film is quite fine too down to the smallest bit parts. The film mixes in Gothic elements which would be a mainstay of Italian horror cinema in the early to mid'60s with more modern styles and Bava's lensing of the duchess' palace with its moldering crypt exquisite ballroom and shadowy passageways is a thing of great and dismal beauty prefiguring his work in Black Sunday. Shot in BW and CinemaScope the film looks just fantastic with Bava proving yet again what a master he was at employing light and shadow. How impressive the film must have looked on the cinema screen back when and how surprising the fact that the picture was NOT an instant success! One odd note here the score by Roman Vlad which especially during the action sequences almost sounds more suitable for a Flash Gordon scifi serial. But other than this the film works just fine a levelheaded entertainment that holds up splendidly well almost 60 years after its premiere. Freda after this film would go on to direct not only Caltiki but two pictures starring the socalled Queen of Horror Barbara Steele The Horrible Dr. Hichcock and The Ghost. As for Bava after getting his feet wet here he soon embarked on one of the most important directing careers in Italian cinema history.

	schema:reviewBody "What a find this was I had read and seen articles on I Vampiri before but never seen it...now that I have I am very impressed. The film is fairly simple and is modestly told but with style atmosphere and simple good cinematography it succeeds.Plot is as follows...it is 1950s black and white France. Local girls are disappearing then turning up dead with all their blood drained away. Police and the local press investigate but it takes a some luck and freak connections to uncover what is going on. Unsurprisingly a family of aristocrats who inhabit a large ornate castle seem to be most heavily implicated...surely the frail and elderly duchess who is never seen without her veil couldn't be a prime suspect...could she? Although the action is not intense or gory I still found the film very enjoyable. For a film with vampire in the title there is a total lack of blood biting or fangs to be seen. Instead it's more like a murder mystery film. The main characters are a reporter and his semigirlfriend a stunning lady who happens to be a younger member of the rich family and a policeman who is doing his best to catch the killer. The Cinemascope format really enhances the appealing black and white photography  watching this in full screen would surely ruin it. The sets and decor are also fantastic especially scenes set in the castle and several decaying apartments and chambers. The acting of the male leads is not that impressive but the girl victims and in particular the gorgeous Gianna Maria Canale as the young aristocrat perform very well.There's a really good twist about halfway through the story which I won't reveal but it is the standout moment of the film  a character suddenly ages rapidly on camera without cuts or dissolves. This incredible effect is repeated twice more and on each of the three occasions I reversed and watched the scene again just to marvel at how good it looked. According to excellent UK magazine is It UNCUT the process was a secret for many years and I am not even going to explain it as it is better if you don't guess how they did it. Most viewers today probably will work it out but I can imagine it perplexed many moviegoers who caught saw it in 1959.Do yourself a favour and track this movie down. Apparently it was not a big success on it's release so we should be thankful for the new Image Entertainment DVD release which presents a beautiful widescreen version of the film. Definitely recommended.".

The film opens with deaths being done by what the newspapers call a vampire.

	schema:headline " Dark British Noir Worth a Look";
	schema:reviewBody "The AngloAmalgamated series of British crime dramas and Films Noirs that featured Hollywood actors tended to find good use for them. STREET OF SHADOWS is no exception. Cesar Romero is just fine as Luigi a pinball pintable clubbar owner in London. His faint Hispanic accent gives him a certain exotic charm and he can take charge of a scene when its required. Along for the ride are Kay Kendall Victor Maddern and Edward Underdown all more than capable of fulfilling their character parts. This is a fairly routine movie but it can keep a viewer guessing and it makes use of some effective visuals. Luigi's club is realistically crowded with drinkers gamblers and novelty machines along with the advertised pinball ones. Most effective are several very darkly filmed sequences in which the viewer is challenged to detect what may be going on. For his role as Limpy Maddern adopts a convincing defect in his walk and his performance is the most affecting in the film. The only problema small oneis the harmonica by Tommy Reilly used prominently in the score. It doesn't really jive well with the urban setting. This won't make you forget BRIGHTON ROCK or THE BIG SLEEP it's just a very decent addition to the British crime movie lineup.".

Cesar Romero is just fine as Luigi a pinball pintable clubbar owner in London. His faint Hispanic accent gives him a certain exotic charm and he can take charge of a scene when its required.

	schema:reviewBody "Street of Shadows AKA Shadow Man is directed by Richard Vernon who also adapts the screenplay from the novel The Creaking Chair written by Laurence Meynell. It stars Cesar Romero Victor Maddern Kay Kendall Simone Silva John Penrose Bill Travers and Liam Gaffney. Music is by Eric Spear with harmonica by Tommy Reilly and cinematography is by Phil Grindod. A good old frameup thriller with noir styling Street of Shadows finds Romero as Luigi the manager of a gaming premises in London's Soho area. When an old acquaintance of his Angele Abbe Silva is found murdered in his apartment he's naturally the chief suspect. Forced to go on the run Luigi hopes that the police or himself can find the real culprit soon. The story is pretty conventional stuff with the mystery element none existent since it can only really be one person who committed the murder. However the benefits elsewhere make this worth sampling by the film noir faithful even if it's not what you would call essential viewing. The whole picture is filmed in the noir style Vernon and Grindod not missing any opportunities for a bit of shadow play or psychologically tinted contrast usage. The backdrop is a dour London of dark streets and alleyways a dank part of the city where sordid characters go about their respective business. These people are either carrying some sort of affliction aggressive or are emotionally stunted. An abused wife a sexually frustrated janitor with a foot disability card sharps a man with huge cauliflower ears a playboy ladies of the night or in the case of Luigi someone who you really wouldn't want to count on. Police Close PinTable Saloon! Luigi's PinTable business is delightfully dingy filled out with slot machines and macabre looking games such as a laughing sailor or Konki The Clown Fortune Teller. Breezing around the place are the two gals Angele and Barbara Gale Kendall getting the lads hot under the collar while the human fortune teller Starry Darrell Molly Hamley Clifford is a splendid character capable of smoothing out Luigi's rough edges. Acting is good with Maddern the stand out performer and how nice to hear good quality Harmonica as part of a musical score. 610".

He's marvelous here very handsome with a great presence using just a touch of his accent. His saloon is crowded chaotic nothing fancy and has a wonderfully '50s atmosphere. Kay Kendall his costar would go on to big fame before her early tragic death recounted in the play In Praise of Love originally starring her thenhusband Rex Harrison.Nothing exceptional except Romero and Kendall but they make it worth seeing.".

It was written and directed by the mysterious Richard Vernon the only film he either wrote or directed about whom little seems to be known. What happened to him? Who was he? Stalwart American actor Cesar Romero was borrowed for this film set in London's Soho with dark streets and alleys as perhaps they were then. Kay Kendall is the love interest. She is what I call a 'fifties bustthruster'. In those days a surprising number of actresses hurled themselves bust first into their roles convinced that this would advance their case. There is something about their stance the way they stood and thrusted which is so comical today. But it must have been effective with men at that time or they would not have done it. An interesting footnote or bustnote for social historians or anthropologists perhaps? Kay Kendall died tragically young of throat cancer and was much lamented. Here she manages an air of mystery and allure though very fifties in every respect. Romero is effortlessly in command of this easy walkthrough. A fine performance is delivered by Victor Maddern as 'Limpy' a pathetic East Ender with a club foot who gets all twisted up inside. Romero runs a pinball club in Soho where Limpy is his janitor and caretaker. Two gals are floating around stirring up various passions on all sides some seamy card sharks are on the scene some rough characters come and go there is a murder there are police and Romero is suspected and runs. Will he clear himself? Can you guess?".

	schema:reviewBody "One of those British thrillers that feels like a cheap imitation of a Hollywood flick as evinced by the presence of onetime leading man Cesar Romero  a man indelibly linked with his later screen role as the Joker for many of us today. STREET OF SHADOWS is a slowpaced and slightly meandering thriller in which Romero is a wronged man who has to cover up a murder and discover the true identity of those responsible. The characters are bland but Kay Kendall and Simone Silva are both voluptuous and alluring femme fatales and tragically neither of them would see out the decade. There's a great role for Victor Madddern and fans will enjoy him as the hunchbacked 'Limpy'.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film at its Moscow Film Festival screening last night at the newfangled Oktyabr multiplex. Mercifully they showed it in English with Russian subtitles on a readout below the screen. Thankfully there was no stupid voiceover or dubbing translation which is what you normally get in Russian cinemas.TEMPESTA was intriguing in its premise but falls absolutely flat in terms of execution. The film does show you something of a new world  that of the profession of art authenticator. The authentication sequences are absorbing in terms of showing how possibly stateoftheart technology and the authenticator's knowhow are used to determine whether a painting is genuine or not. You do learn things like cobalt being a pigment that was first used in the 19th century and so couldn't be used in paintings from the turn of the 15th to the 16th century but it feels like either there should be some more exposition of this kind or that it would be better off in a documentary about art authentication.The film's one redeeming quality is its fairly intricate cinematography which is welllit has some elaborate multiple dissolves and picturepostcard views of Venice. It really made me want to go to Venice. The carnival sequence even has a slight raciness about it that makes one a bit pumped to go for the promise of some Italian hot tuna. I'm a bit surprised they didn't try to premiere this at the Venice Film Festival.I went to go see the film on the strength of the male supporting cast namely Rutger Hauer Malcolm McDowell and Tcheky Karyo. Now the former two actors tend to do a lot of straighttovideo schlock but in the right project they could be dynamite. This is not that kind of project and while McDowell livens the proceedings up with his haughty snooty turn as an art historian with some secrets Hauer just walks nonchalantly through his role as Van Beunigen the director of the Galleria dell'Accademia. However to be fair to Hauer he isn't given much to do. Paul Guilfoyle's stint as the mafiosi Rossi has a bit of spark and kind of reminds me a little of William Hurt in A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. The other performances including the young leads are pretty wooden and misdirected for the most part.The whole story of skulduggery in the Venice art world is pretty anemic. Despite the seemingly dynamic thefts and bravura stilettointheeye killings it strangely lacks dramatic thrust and is never in the least bit convincing. The love interest situation is pat and even slightly comical rather than involving or in the least bit erotic. In general the proceedings have a sort of phonedin quality similar to the lead character's conversation with the insurance company that hired him back in New York.The initial cast listing on IMDb.com was perplexing as it listed McDowell and Karyo as playing a character named Valenzin. One thing's for sure there is only one Valenzin character in the film and Karyo is definitely NOT playing him which leads me to believe that he was supposed to be cast but was replaced by McDowell. Oh well so much the better for Karyo in a way. At least he doesn't have another subpar movie in his resume.".

	schema:headline " Epic and spectacular Spanish version about Christ  focusing the traitor apostle Judas Iscariote";
	schema:reviewBody "An evocative version of Jesus Christ's life with a true Spanish allstarepic treatment and being spectacularly shot in Spain and Israel . This highly regarded epic deals with a dramatic recreation of the life of Christ from Judas's Rafael Rivelles point of sight . Dealing with Apostles Pedro  Manuel Monroy  Santiago Arturo Fernndez miracles  judgement  Sanedrn with major priest Fariseo Caifas and Misael Flix Dafauce  and  finally  Crucifixion . Interesting retelling at the life and teachings of Christ Jos Nieto under a historical and religious view point . The film includes all of the major events referred to in the New Testament with descriptive Biblical passages  John the Baptist's appearance  the miracles as Lazaro's Resurrection  cripples walking  blind people seeing  Canaan weddings with transformation water into wine  the Roman officer Quinto Licinio Francisco Rabal  his relationship to 12 apostles  his entry in city of Jerusalem  Veronica's shroud  Christ passion  Golgotha  the thieves  Dimas and Gestas  and so on . Jesus Christ's journey from Galilee to Golgotha is portrayed here in thoughtprovoking as well as enjoyable treatment . John the Baptist and Pontius Pilate Gerard Tichy who played Joseph husband of Mary six years later in the HollywoodSpanish epic King of Kings are also regarded . However  not completely reverential at some Biblical characters such as Judas Iscariote portraying the man less a traitor than as an unsettling as well as regretful person . This is an impressive story of the life of Judas and his relationship with Jesus Christ to his Crucifixion and subsequent Resurrection . Filmed on a relatively grand scale  though unfortunately in black and white  being efficiently produced by Aspa Productions adding big name cast  and fine support actors . Life of Christ is intelligently told by prestigious screenwriter Vicente Escriv  including glowing cinematography in black and white by Alfredo Fraile  an attractive visual style  memorable soundtrack by the classical Cristbal Halffter and excellent cast giving largerthanlife interpretation . Rafael Rivelles provides a very good acting as a furtive as well as shifty Judas  Rivelles in exactly the right role  similarly to El Quijote he delivers a dedicated effort at the character  his acting has power  nobility and subtlety .

	onyx:emotionText "An evocative version of Jesus Christ's life with a true Spanish allstarepic treatment and being spectacularly shot in Spain and Israel . This highly regarded epic deals with a dramatic recreation of the life of Christ from Judas's Rafael Rivelles point of sight . Dealing with Apostles Pedro  Manuel Monroy  Santiago Arturo Fernndez miracles  judgement  Sanedrn with major priest Fariseo Caifas and Misael Flix Dafauce  and  finally  Crucifixion . Interesting retelling at the life and teachings of Christ Jos Nieto under a historical and religious view point . The film includes all of the major events referred to in the New Testament with descriptive Biblical passages  John the Baptist's appearance  the miracles as Lazaro's Resurrection  cripples walking  blind people seeing  Canaan weddings with transformation water into wine  the Roman officer Quinto Licinio Francisco Rabal  his relationship to 12 apostles  his entry in city of Jerusalem  Veronica's shroud  Christ passion  Golgotha  the thieves  Dimas and Gestas  and so on . Jesus Christ's journey from Galilee to Golgotha is portrayed here in thoughtprovoking as well as enjoyable treatment . John the Baptist and Pontius Pilate Gerard Tichy who played Joseph husband of Mary six years later in the HollywoodSpanish epic King of Kings are also regarded . However  not completely reverential at some Biblical characters such as Judas Iscariote portraying the man less a traitor than as an unsettling as well as regretful person . This is an impressive story of the life of Judas and his relationship with Jesus Christ to his Crucifixion and subsequent Resurrection . Filmed on a relatively grand scale  though unfortunately in black and white  being efficiently produced by Aspa Productions adding big name cast  and fine support actors . Life of Christ is intelligently told by prestigious screenwriter Vicente Escriv  including glowing cinematography in black and white by Alfredo Fraile  an attractive visual style  memorable soundtrack by the classical Cristbal Halffter and excellent cast giving largerthanlife interpretation . Rafael Rivelles provides a very good acting as a furtive as well as shifty Judas  Rivelles in exactly the right role  similarly to El Quijote he delivers a dedicated effort at the character  his acting has power  nobility and subtlety . Being a big Spanish production shot in Spain and Palestina there appears several Spanish actors in brief performances such as Fernando Sancho  Jos Nieto  Manuel Monroy  German Cobos  Jos Manuel Martin  Milagros Leal  Santiago Rivero  Flix Dafauce  among others .

	schema:reviewBody "To be honest the only reason that I went to watch this movie at the cinema was because I attend a club which involves dancing. Quite a few of the routines that we do are based on songs or dance sequences from movies such as Step Up. Upon seeing the trailers for Make It Happen I thought that I should go to see it just in case we try a routine which is related to the film. Still I am likely to commend myself if I can remember most of this lacklustre movie in a couple of weeks.Lauryn Mary Elizabeth Winstead has dreamt of being a dancer for most of her life. However after auditioning for the prestigious Chicago School of Music and Dance and being rejected her hopes are severely damaged. Soon after this failure she becomes a dancer at a burlesque club called Ruby's and is a major success. However Lauryn's family and her dreams soon begin to clash and she must choose between the two...Make It Happen contains two positive elements. The dance sequences are extremely sexy and are also packed with confident energy. In the lead role Mary Elizabeth Winstead is instantly likable and human. She isn't terrific but she is still good enough that she puts the rest of the cast who seem to be waiting for their pay cheques to shame.Unfortunately apart from the dancing and Winstead's performance the movie falls flat. The plot is utterly predictable the writing and direction are incredibly lazy and the pacing drags. This just feels like an attempt to cash in on the big public response to movies such as the High School Musical and Step Up instalments.So my recommendation is to give this film a miss. I'm not really a fan of this type of movie but I don't think that even hardcore fans will be satisfied by this superficial product. If you're looking for a good enjoyable and pure musical experience at the cinema it's still not too late to catch Mamma Mia!".

	schema:reviewBody "OMG I have so totally like just seen this chickflick and I'm so What are all these teenage girls doing at this movie? To be fair nobody actually talks like this in the movie but I just feel that it probably represents the target demographic. I'm pretty certain that as an old git I'm not in the target demographic. Hang on to your hats I'm going to spoiler this one bigtime.First of all this movie has the Most Forgettable Title Of All Time. I kept trying to remember it on the way home and I got Bring It On Never Give Up and several like that. All wrong. It's Make It Happen. Make It Happen. Got that? Good. Don't forget.What? You forgot already? Yeah me too.So Lauryn heads out the 600 miles from Hickville to Chicago to audition for dance school. Now they're auditioning 2000 kids for 20 places so it's no surprise to us when Lauryn lasts 30 seconds before being booted off the stage. She withdraws to a coffee shop to nurse her disappointment only for her car to be towed away in the middle of a thunderstorm. She is lucky therefore to encounter Dana the young waitress and also the Kindest And Most Trusting Person In The History Of Movies. Dana offers Lauryn a complete stranger not only indefinite board and lodgings back at her apartment but also an introduction which leads to Lauryn getting a job as bookkeeper  she was a bookkeeper back home I confess to feeling a rosy glow at this point what with being firmly rooted in the beancounting business myself. It turns out that this job is at Ruby's owned confusingly not by Ruby but by Brenda where we discover Dana dances when she's not being a waitress. Having danced Dana more or less disappears from the movie at this point. And Lauryn is saved from having to tell her brother Russ back home that she failed the audition.The writers of this movie have clearly made more than one visit to the Clich Mine and have emerged loaded down with swag on each visit because as I am sure you are expecting the next thing to happen is for Brenda to be faced with no dancers following which Lauryn steps into the breach and is a sensation.A word about the dancing at Ruby's. This is a club which features dancing and Brenda explains that she's after a different sort of dancing. She sure is. It is raunchy dancing which isn't raunchy. It's clearly intended to be raunchy but the movie is PG which means any little kid can see it. So raunchy translates as mildly suggestive. When the dancer rips off her skirt there's another smaller skirt below it that kind of thing. But the crowd appear to love it whistling and whooping like nobody's business. Go figure.So Lauryn does a bit of dancing for Brenda and a romance starts with the bloke who does the music he encourages Lauryn to go for the special extra oneoff additional audition for a further 2 places at dance school which just became vacant. Further clichs heave into view...But before contact is made with them Lauryn's brother Russ arrives at Ruby's and leaves in some distress that Lauryn is dancing fully clothed in a mildly suggestive manner. During the argument which follows he tells her that the garage  their late father's  is just about to go broke and he blames her for their father's death. Stricken with guilt Lauryn returns to start bookkeeping like mad at the garage.But Russ realises that he shouldn't have emotionally blackmailed his sister into giving up her dream just to save the garage and packs her off to the audition. As she arrives the musical boyfriend gives her a new track he's just finished it turns out to be the unfinished one she'd encouraged him to finish earlier no surprise there then. She's too late for the emergency extra auditions but she throws a completely out of character wobbly and dances anyway. I was very impressed with this  dancing perfectly to a piece of music she hadn't heard before said dance incorporating things like the piano and steps which are on stage the locations of which she couldn't have anticipated.So it will come as no surprise to you to learn  guess what  that she passes the audition. The garage goes down the tubes but what the hey.This movie was drivel. Recycled drivel at that. But I kind of enjoyed it anyway. Lauryn is a pretty personable girl Mary Elizabeth Winstead Bruce Willis' daughter in Die Hard 4 and quite attractively drawn as a character. She dances OK too although the dance sequences don't have the vitality and dynamism of those in say Fame Footloose Dirty Dancing etc.Don't expect to be surprised at any point though. Especially after you've read this!".

She dances OK too although the dance sequences don't have the vitality and dynamism of those in say Fame Footloose Dirty Dancing etc.Don't expect to be surprised at any point though. Especially after you've read this!";

However she becomes good when she basically lap dances her way in. This is her great adventure. The film attempts to make it seem decent and respectful to women by putting some cheering women in the crowd. Second the film is basically exactly the same as 'Save the Last Dance' which I enjoyed. The plot is more or less the same without the racial issues in her area and less convincing acting. While the plot to Step Up 2 basically fell through the film was saved by the stunning dance routines. The dancing here was not particularly spellbinding to tell the truth. Finally the film is so thoroughly formulaic that I basically was able to plan out all the events in the first 10 minutes. Girl goes to audition but is crushed girl is taken in by friendly girl and is given a bookkeepers job girl meets attractive boy but sees him as being arrogant and not nice girl makes out with attractive not nice arrogant boy girl randomly gets on stage and everyone realises she is a star girl realises her dreams conflict with... things girl is sent by domineering brother to audition girl gets into college!! horrid bitchy person turns out to only have been trying to help her and they are now good friends... EtcKeep your hard earned cash and go see WALLE instead.".

There wasn't as much dancing and music as I expected but for me that didn't matter since I was more interested in the story. Having said that I enjoyed what dancing and music there was very much!

	schema:reviewBody "It was no surprise that throughout Make It Happen's 80minutes duration one would find this latest dance flick helmed by occasional music director Darren Grant riddled with the most tiresome and obnoxious clichs that the genre could offer across its existence. Yes to be fair the film seems to be borrowing each scene from similarly plotted features. Yet in one way or another Make It Happen seems to present all of them just that better.One of the flick's greatest and most undeniable asset would be lead Mary Elizabeth Winstead who displays some of her best work here. It's hard not to swoon for Winstead who switches from ferocious limbswinging urban dancer to ingnue downtoearth cornfed small town girl with impressive and flawless flair. She seems born for the role radiating an unbelievable amount of charm and drawing life into a wellwritten character. Despite having been supplied with a prosaic script Winstead performs admirably well both on and offstage.Regardless of Winstead's poetic beauty the film lacks a substantial screenplay and every line feels tacky and uninspired. It's safe to say that the film is no more scripted than it is choreographed. Adler's libretto felt unremarkably familiar and with or without hindsight you could almost tell how the film will unfold before the lights dim down. It was fortunate that the rest of the troops though never coming close to stealing the show leave that to Winstead played their  stereotypical  parts adequately with the provocative Julissa Bermudez standing out exiguously.The film's lack of flesh on show is an affront to the cast's sensual slinky sex appeal and it is hard to find that the clubgoers are majorly made up of cheering females rather than drooling guys. However the dances are already enticing in nature so more skin would not have been necessary but simply more effective. Speaking of the dance sequences are entertainingly beautiful aided with a catchy soundtrack and as a whole undeniably a visual and aural delight  a testament to the eyes and ears.Make It Happen is not much a film rather than a montage of energetic dance romps connected solely by filler sequences enlaced with drama and romance. That said they are good sequences of drama as Winstead's verisimilar approach to her character enlivens each of the film's dramatic scenes. The same cannot be said for the sequences of romance though. Try as they might the pairing of Winstead and Smith lacks chemistry and as a result the film is forced to present a dull romance that you couldn't care for. It doesn't help that Smith's character is near unlikable  as another critic put it  a smarmy douche.All the same Grant's experience in the music video industry helped a lot here. Stunning cinematography entwine each scene and the dance sequences are nothing short of being optically magnificent. Although there might not be much to entertain those with a passionate dislike of this variety it is nevertheless a fine installment into the dance genre. Make It Happen passes as both a short drama film entwined with great dance sequences and an overtly long energetic music video interweaved with filler drama scenes. However you put it I believe Make It Happen is still a decent film.Verdict Darren Grant has crafted an enjoyable popcorn dance flick an improvement over the recent additions to the genre. There's still much room for improvement but Winstead's soulful performance atones for much of the flaws. Nevertheless its feeble screenplay and extremely predictable fadeout could not go off easily unnoticed.".

	schema:reviewBody "How do you approach a dance movie? I feel that the story takes a firm back seat in providing a wafer thin excuse to string some opportunities for dancing onto the screen. Granted there are some excellent story lines that come once in a while but most times you'd get the rudimentary dancer character who has to prove that heshe can dance to a group of naysayers consisting of peers or snooty judges fall in love and of course to rise above all challenges to claim the prize  gain acceptance from the community.Brought to us from the writer of movies such as The Step Up and Save The Last Dance movies here comes something that doesn't disappoint in that it sticks to formula so that you know what to expect nothing more or less. Mary Elizabeth Winstead who played John McClane's grown up daughter in Die Hard 4 and scream queen in Final Destination 3 takes on the mantle of the downtrodden dancer wannabe Lauryn who felt that she's responsible for the family garage business until she decides to pursue her dream by leaving the small town and head for the bright lights in the big city.Her audition with the Chicago School of Music and Dance was a complete washout and confidence shaken takes to the temping at a lounge called Ruby's where she helps to cook the books. But you can bet your last dollar that this is the venue with which she'll fall in love with a fellow music engineer Russ Riley Smith while lapping the coincidental opportunities for her to showcase some of her moves before becoming an established member of the pussycat dolls of dance.Story aside which packed a wallop with superficial antsy challenges from established peers an unforgiving brother who couldn't fathom her passion and a boyfriend who can't wait to get into her pants coupled with the nagging thought of failure and that she's no good for the Ivy League school for dance we're really here for the set dance pieces aren't we? There aren't many of them which stood out given that they aren't as innovative or fused some genres together to come up with an amalgam of moves though the character of Lauryn probably was supposed to show how an unpolished gem got to go through the paces at a club before coming through and achieving success by her measure.And the lounge setting does provide for some sensual provocative costumes to drape the lithe and tall frame of Winstead's though I had to admit I thought her assortment of hoods wigs and the likes provided for some convenient coverup for a body double to take over until of course I read that she had some background in dance. There are some routines that I genuinely liked but the one at the finale which should be the mother of all moves in any dance movie was the one that seriously packed a punch with improvisation and a combination of ballet with hiphop without being too obvious or conscious about it.Yes you've seen one you've seen them all at least for the narrative aspect. If you're patient to sit through the dramatic portions you'll find yourself cheering with the crowd when the dancers take to the platform. Soundtrack too was nothing short of expectations and I give it brownie points for the inclusion of a disco retro.".

She never seems to be able to dance in time to the music either always pausing or moving too fast. Very very annoying. The storyline is total rubbish as well. I didn't think it could get much worse than Save the Last Dance 2 but i was clearly proved wrong with this one. This film is not a patch on the original dance movies like Dirty Dancing and the 1st Save the Last Dance and it certainly does not deserve to be put in the same category as these.

Like its forerunners 'Make It Happen' follows a generic storyline. Country gal' Lauryn Mary Elizabeth Winstead leaves hicks ville to pursue dancing in the big smokeonly to be bitterly disappointed when her audition for the Chicago School of Music and Dance ends up a spectacular flop. Dreams shattered Lauryn finds work at seedy burlesque club 'Ruby's'. Here she meets disc jockey Russ Riley Smith where an inevitable spark is lit between the two. Pretty soon her dance career heats up also she takes center stage performing burlesquehiphop fusions to a screaming audience each night. It is at 'Ruby's' where Lauryn is forced to reevaluate her dreams her family her life and lovetaking her on the ultimate journey of self discovery Lauryn's transformation from heavily madeup sexy country hick to heavily madeup sexy danceris nothing short ofwellnothing. Lauryn is a flat uninspired martyr who comes across as the ultimate dripa wet blanket some might say. Winstead has a certain screen presenceyet the script dumbs down any moments of authenticity in her performance. The supporting cast is not worth mentioning they play it by the numbers and it's all a very trite.But who gives a Shiite about the characters and story? I hear you sayWe're all watching it for the dancing! Surely a film with such a wafer thin plot and stale protagonists would compensate with breathtaking sexy and exhilarating dance sequencesright? WRONG. When the dance sequences should be sizzling they end up fizzlingwhen they are about to pack a punch they give the audience a floppy and limp wrist. They are competently filmed and edited with a sense of rhythm yet memorable moments  ZILL. The film attempts to explore the somewhat risqu style of burlesque dancebut wants to keep a PG ratingso everything about 'Ruby's' feels completely toned down.For a dance movie there is very little dancing. Unfortunately this means the audience sits through excessive amounts of predictable dialog before anything remotely exciting happens. At times it almost reaches it's so lame it's good! statusbut never quite gets there. 'Make It Happen' really doesn't make anything happen at allsave your money and watch highlights of So You Think You Can Dance on You Tube.".

	schema:headline " He said the first name they didn't say their last word ...";
	schema:reviewBody "What Le Prnom The First Name accomplished was a miracle it restored my faith on French comedy.Indeed just when I thought that they were forever condemned to rely their success on simplistic and childish plots compensated with starstudded cast or some more or less abuse of that parodist humor mostly inspired from TV Alexandre de La Patellire's film reminds us that even in our cynical Internet days it was possible to make people laugh with delightful dialogues and realistic human interactions with the perfect cocktail of gentleness and cynicism something I didn't think was possible since Le Diner de Cons.And it's true that Le Prnom is really the descendant of Francis Veber's masterpiece and not just on its excellent sophistication that never patronizes the spectator. On the form too there are similarities worth to be noticed both movies are based on popular plays The Birdcage was another example of successful adaptation from stage to the big screen. The movie perfectly combines a respect of the unity of time place and plot with a delightful premise a friendly dinner in upperclass Parisian house that turns sour when one of the guest revealed the name he decided to give to his future son shattering instantly the harmony and friendship between a memorable gallery of characters.Vincent Patrick Bruel in a very interesting and nuanced performance is Vincent the brother of Babou Elizabeth played by the late Valerie Benguigi a modest teacher married to a literature professor Pierre played by Charles Berling. Joining them is a meek effeminate and nonconfrontational musician Claude played by Guillaume de Tonqudec and Anna Judith El Zein as Vincent's pregnant wife carrying in her womb the roots of the discord. Five characters that's enough to setup one of the funniest comedies of the last years. Both Guillaume de Tonqudec and Valrie Ben Guigui won the Csar for Best Supporting role and the only bit of sadness conveyed by the film is Benguigui's untimely passing at the age of 47.Indeed It's impossible not to think of that sad loss for French Cinma while watching Le Prnom and I'm glad she won the Csar as a tribute to an immense talent that will be sadly missed. She left Cinema with a poignant and funny performance that will be remembered in the years to come Now how about that firstname that will ignite the fire of discord and misunderstanding? Although it's very tempting but I won't give it away out of respect for the screenplay and because one of the first delights is to play that game with Vincent when he challenges to guess the name he picked for his son. It's not an unknown name which makes the exercise even more suspenseful and once you know it you understand why it was so polemical. I wondered for months what was that was mysterious name and how could it provoke a clash I'm glad I didn't have a clue till the day I saw the film. And yes they couldn't have come up with a worse name.But don't worry the film isn't centered only on the names' subject it's just a starter to what will turn into something as chaotic as Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? where all the guests will have to say what they truly think and get rid of the whole social hypocrisy. And this is one of the aspects that make Le Prnom such a great comedy it's a clever social commentary on the behavior of French elite and the way their interactions their speech mannerism or body language betray their political beliefs and their true feelings about socalled friends.It's a reminder of the way sometimes conflicts can have a sane effect by luring us to reveal the most sincere part of ourselves and what more eloquent than the way we name people we love to speak about us. I myself am tired with people in my country who gave their children name that sound foreign because they know that today having an Arabic name can be a handicap for me these people are either accomplice of the system acknowledging the very hate their people inspire and be part of it driven by a form of unconscious cowardice. I could relate to a story like that and I'm sure I can get excitable when it comes to such subjects.So behind the funny surface Le Prnom is an extremely intelligent movie and deep in the way it tackles social interactions much more when they touch family and friendship. There'll always be someone who'll be taken for what he is not and a simple sentence one too much can work like a wakeup call. And just when you think you pointed your finger on someone's flaw you realize you're not beyond criticism either and this is the main lesson of Le Prnom it's about understanding each other and respecting both people's choices and opinions without being too wrapped up in one's egos.And at the end the battle of egos turn into a recognition of each one's plea and what starts like a comedy end like a great lesson about humility. Yet the film doesn't conclude on a serious note and the ending is the perfect punch line to it. When it ended I found every bit of the film most satisfying tasting like a good wine that thankfully never went too sour. And as I said as an aspiring screenwriter I wish I could come up with a film half that good. Of course I could throw some oneliners here and there but taken out of their context they wouldn't have the same effect much more they might give clues about that infamous name that started all.So please just watch it if only to discover what is that mysterious name  but be a good movie fans good sports and don't cheat.".

	onyx:emotionText "What Le Prnom The First Name accomplished was a miracle it restored my faith on French comedy.Indeed just when I thought that they were forever condemned to rely their success on simplistic and childish plots compensated with starstudded cast or some more or less abuse of that parodist humor mostly inspired from TV Alexandre de La Patellire's film reminds us that even in our cynical Internet days it was possible to make people laugh with delightful dialogues and realistic human interactions with the perfect cocktail of gentleness and cynicism something I didn't think was possible since Le Diner de Cons.And it's true that Le Prnom is really the descendant of Francis Veber's masterpiece and not just on its excellent sophistication that never patronizes the spectator. On the form too there are similarities worth to be noticed both movies are based on popular plays The Birdcage was another example of successful adaptation from stage to the big screen. The movie perfectly combines a respect of the unity of time place and plot with a delightful premise a friendly dinner in upperclass Parisian house that turns sour when one of the guest revealed the name he decided to give to his future son shattering instantly the harmony and friendship between a memorable gallery of characters.Vincent Patrick Bruel in a very interesting and nuanced performance is Vincent the brother of Babou Elizabeth played by the late Valerie Benguigi a modest teacher married to a literature professor Pierre played by Charles Berling. Joining them is a meek effeminate and nonconfrontational musician Claude played by Guillaume de Tonqudec and Anna Judith El Zein as Vincent's pregnant wife carrying in her womb the roots of the discord. Five characters that's enough to setup one of the funniest comedies of the last years. Both Guillaume de Tonqudec and Valrie Ben Guigui won the Csar for Best Supporting role and the only bit of sadness conveyed by the film is Benguigui's untimely passing at the age of 47.Indeed It's impossible not to think of that sad loss for French Cinma while watching Le Prnom and I'm glad she won the Csar as a tribute to an immense talent that will be sadly missed. She left Cinema with a poignant and funny performance that will be remembered in the years to come Now how about that firstname that will ignite the fire of discord and misunderstanding? Although it's very tempting but I won't give it away out of respect for the screenplay and because one of the first delights is to play that game with Vincent when he challenges to guess the name he picked for his son. It's not an unknown name which makes the exercise even more suspenseful and once you know it you understand why it was so polemical. I wondered for months what was that was mysterious name and how could it provoke a clash I'm glad I didn't have a clue till the day I saw the film.

I found out afterwards that it was adapted by Mathieu Delaporte and Alexandre de la Patelliere based on their 2011 stage play. This script of this film is reminiscent of a 2008 French play by Yasmina Reza called Gods of Carnage made into a film called Carnage by Roman Polanski. That playfilm had two middleaged couple whose arguments begin from a fight between their sons to topics totally different from what they started talking about. As with other foreign language films I felt a lot of the humor and wit is lost in translation into the English subtitles.

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the premise I had high expectations for this film. I was not disappointed. The film however started out I thought too quickly too cleverly a la Amelie Poulain with its introductions and back stories of the main characters. When the film settled down inside the apartment the film got back on track to a pace I could enjoy. The dialogue is wonderful between the characters each character having a unique voice and talking about subjects I would talk about at a dinner party. Each character had a certain point of view unique yet relatable. Although the title is only a springboard to other subjects it does start the film rolling and roll it does from jokes to misunderstandings to secrets to childhood resentments to pent up rage reaching it's climax during Babu's meltdown. Although all the characters are interesting it is Babu we are rooting for. I loved Valrie Benguigui's amazing performance. I'd never seen her in films and I hope that I get to see more of her. The other actors are also fine in their roles. I must also say that Francoise Fabian has just aged beautifully. The first time I saw her was in Eric Rohmer's MY NIGHT AT MAUDS'S which was released in 1969. She still looks amazing.....I wrote this review before reading all the credits and was saddened to learn that Valerie Benguigui passed away in 2013 from cancer.

	onyx:emotionText "Based on the premise I had high expectations for this film. I was not disappointed. The film however started out I thought too quickly too cleverly a la Amelie Poulain with its introductions and back stories of the main characters. When the film settled down inside the apartment the film got back on track to a pace I could enjoy. The dialogue is wonderful between the characters each character having a unique voice and talking about subjects I would talk about at a dinner party. Each character had a certain point of view unique yet relatable. Although the title is only a springboard to other subjects it does start the film rolling and roll it does from jokes to misunderstandings to secrets to childhood resentments to pent up rage reaching it's climax during Babu's meltdown. Although all the characters are interesting it is Babu we are rooting for. I loved Valrie Benguigui's amazing performance. I'd never seen her in films and I hope that I get to see more of her. The other actors are also fine in their roles. I must also say that Francoise Fabian has just aged beautifully. The first time I saw her was in Eric Rohmer's MY NIGHT AT MAUDS'S which was released in 1969. She still looks amazing.....I wrote this review before reading all the credits and was saddened to learn that Valerie Benguigui passed away in 2013 from cancer. People are here for a short time and they leave us. Some if lucky leave behind something that is forever in the cultural landscape. I'm glad I was witness to this beautiful film and beautiful performance ..Rest in Peace";

The history of their relationships is really what all the discussions lead to not to mention each spewing their heart out over revelations that occur during the discussions. The ending scenes make the whole movie worth watching it is not a disappointment which it could have been if not for the smart screenplay.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had the chance to see Le Prnom during an Air France flight. Flying is always a chance to see new movies and taking advantage of the extensive menu of movies that are unknown in Mexico I took a chance with something I'll hardly see in my country. Between the various french productions I saw this one mainly because it was starred by Patrick Bruel when I was a kid I enjoyed a lot his movie Le Jaguar 1996 so I decided to see his acting once again now that I have more experience and could appreciate it better.Le Prnom is a sitcom which relies on a clever script and in the work of the actors who play a group of friends two marriages and a single man that meet for a dinner to celebrate the future birth of the son of one of the couples. However when the name chosen for the baby is revealed it turns out completely unlikeable to the rest of the group. Vincent Bruel announces he will be called Adolphe in honor of a literary character of the XIX Century but everyone else can only think about Adolf Hitler. From that point on the conflict between the five characters escalates and during the evening secrets and quarrels will be revealed leaving no one untouched.When it starts the movie is really good the first discussion is between Vincent and Claude Gillaume de Toquedec the main opposer to the chosen name and it has great dialogs and convincing arguments for both points of view it is ingenious funny and definitively the best of the picture which regretfully can't keep this highpoint during all its runtime. When the movie goes on we find out Adolphe is not the real name for the kid and that everything is nothing but a practical joke played by Vincent however this is not revealed to the characters in time and once it is is to late to stop the conflict between everyone of them. By this point the movie has lost its novelty the viewer quickly learns how events will unfold and thus it misses some fun. A discussion ends a silence fills the place and you know that at any moment someone will let out a comment that will lead to a new argument with some of the characters that so far have avoided the fighting indeed that's what happens. The acting remains solid and the movie is still entertaining but not surprising.By the end every character is unhappy and everything seems to show that nothing will ever be the same between them this is were the ending comes and from my point of view it badly hurts the rest of the movie. We see the birth of the baby which turns out to be a girls instead of a boy and the parents call their friends so they can meet the newborn everyone is just as happy as always and it would appear that nothing happened during that dinner their friendship will go on with no changes. I don't have anything against happy endings and I wouldn't have any problem with the movie if the conflict had been solved in other way but it all happens so fast and with no explanation that it left me with the feeling that the writers and the director didn't gave much of a thought to this and just took the easy way out. The ending leaves everything we saw without any consequence and thus it takes all the significance of what could have been a better film.Good acting funny dialogs and a good script but all hurted by a bad ending still it ain't a bad effort and you will have fun if You watch it give it a chance if you have the time.".

Excepting the introduction which is funny but has little to do with the film and the final few minutes which could have been much better all the play ... sorry ... the film takes place in a Parisian apartment where five characters midclass midage meet for dinner and live the crisis of their lives triggered by a practical joke one of them makes related to the name of his babytocome. As in Polanski's 'Carnage' which brought to screen a play by Yasmina Reza the border between theater and film is never really crossed. Actually this filmplay is so close to Reza's style that I would have been fooled easily if they told me it's written by her. Alexandre de la Patelliere and Mathieu Delaporte brought to screen Delaporte's play and it looks like they do not have any other ambition than bringing to broader audiences the same story of good friends discovering unknown truths and hidden aspects of each other's personalities. Every ten minutes or so we do have a new revelation each one about another of the characters involved which will put at try family relations and friendships forged decades back in childhood. There are no social comments of actuality and no political subtones if we exclude some references to the left vs. conservative stereotypes and probably the most significant and funniest reference is made to political correctness related to the selection of the name of the baby boy but it is consumed unfortunately in the first third of the movie. However this may play eventually in the favor of the text keeping it timeless and helping it stay actual even if read and played many years or decades from now. At the end of the day viewing 'Le prenom' is an enjoyable experience and this is due to the well written dialog it's a filmed play but a good one and to the excellent acting. I especially liked the pair of brother and sister Patrick Bruel and Valerie Benguigi who succeed both to bring reallife nuances to their characters supplementary to the complexity and wit which is derived from the text. Do not avoid 'Le prenom' if it comes soon on a screen or a stage close to your place.".

Vincent Bruel  a fine French actor btw. tries to push the buttons of his liberal lefty brotherinlaw Pierre for personal amusement. He tells Pierre that he Vincent and his wife Anna are planning to call their firstborn son 'Adolphe'. The exchange between them leads almost inevitably to a heated conversation about naming conventions perceptions of names and ultimately into a metadiscussion about values and bigotry. Mind you Pierre's children are called Appolin and Myrtille in the translated version she was named Melody.The evening goes totally south from there with everybody having some sort of beef with each other and not holding back at spilling the beans. There is a lot of resentment and a lot of venom flying all over. However the movie ends on a happy note.Since almost the entire movie takes place in the apartment of Pierre and Elisabeth it solely relies on the interaction between the characters. And this is what makes the movie great IMO. The exchanges are really well written witty and funny. They are also very hurtful most of them are nasty blows below the belt. This is the part that makes it real fun to watch. Even though most of the dialogue is a kick in the teeth it is still poignant and delivered with panache. A real treat to watch. I would have loved to watch them in French but this would have been a waste. However the translation was superb from what I could gather. It's not easy to make a good movie that is solely dialoguedriven but this one pulls it off.As mentioned since it did not concern me the entire 'bouquet' of dialogue insults innuendos allegations and hard truths did really made laugh. A fantastic piece of French comedy with subtle undercurrents and punches aimed at the idyllic suburban life of the upper? middle class. In short one of the best dramedys I've seen in some time. Well written well acted and directed! I only realised after checking it that the team behind this one did also Bis 2015 L'immortel 2010 and Renaissance 2006.

This sets off a heated exchange between Vincent and Pierre Charles Berling from L'Ennui etc his uptight and educated left wing brotherinlaw and long suffering wife Elizabeth Valerie Benguigui.

This bitingly savage and hilarious comedydrama is a bit like a Gallic version of Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf or the recent Carnage in which a dinner party goes out of control and the guests verbally tear strips off each other. Noone emerges from the evening unscathed. There are many twists before the evening is over and many will blind side audiences familiar with this type of claustrophobic drama. The staging is very theatrical in nature as the action is confined to Pierre and Elizabeth's living room. It's not surprising to learn that writer and codirector Matthieu Delaporte first conceived the idea as a stage play but then decided to turn it into a feature film. Delaporte and Alexandre De La Patelliere have collaborated as writers on a number of films including 22 Bullets and an Iron Man television series. While Delaporte has directed one other film his writing partner De La Patelliere is making his debut with this film. Their direction is fluid and they maintain the pace throughout this dialogue driven film. The astute erudite and crisp screenplay delivers a barrage of verbal zingers and caustic put downs and the tone shifts seamlessly between the comic and the dark and serious. The chemistry between the five person ensemble cast is electric. Production designer Marie Cheminel has created a wonderfully warm book lined set that is the perfect backdrop for the verbal sparring.".

Both movies focus largely on dinner parties involving close friends andor families skeletons closets home truths  perm any two from three. This takes about a reel and a half to hit its stride after which it delivers consistently. It benefits from a fine screenplay and some great ensemble acting by people we don't see that often outside France with Patrick Bruehl and Charles Berling having the highest profiles. It's not going to win any prizes for originality but against that it does take a wellworn plot and breathe new life into it as a fairly banal practical joke triggers repercussions far outside the scope of the original intention and a closeknit group edges close to the brink of fragmentation. It would be churlish to single out any one of the high quality performances and I for one will certainly watch it again.".

	schema:reviewBody "A family is preparing to have a dinner party together in a French apartment. It is being hosted by Elisabeth Valerie Benguigui and Pierre Charles Berling while the first two guests are Vincent Patrick Bruel who is Elisabeth's brother and Claude Guillaume de Tonquedec who is a childhood friend. Vincent arrives before his pregnant wife Anna Judith El Zein and one of the main discussions is what they will be naming their child. To create havoc Vincent elects to tell them a controversial name. His one small lie unleashes the fury of Pierre first and then numerous other arguments breakout revealing each of their personalities but also some long buried family secrets and some unexpected conflicts and surprises. There are pleasures to be found in this minor French comedy it just takes time to reflect on them. Adapted from a play the film seems as though it lacks cinematic stylisation. The technical elements leave something to be desired because this is directors Alexandre de La Patelliere and Matthieu Delaporte's first feature film from Delaporte's own play. The film is set almost entirely in one area which isn't new but the camera is largely static and the actors stand around waiting for their turn to speak. One of the saving graces for the film though is that the humour shifts between highbrow French culture and then gleefully embraces a silly side too. The film opens with the repeat images of people throughout French history being assassinated through the macabre route. This establishes the rather black rim that borders around the jokes. The film is about figurative character assassinations as people shoot each other down based on their interests or their insecurities. Pierre and Vincent argue about the political incorrectness of the baby name he is said to have chosen I guessed prematurely what it was and then Vincent argues that he took it from a literary text and they fight over the spelling of the name. The dialogue is written with rare microscopic details and then the humour and jokes broaden as the power plays between the characters shift. Vincent the instigator suddenly becomes the butt of people's jokes like when they torment him about his facial expressions. Similarly after being left out of conversations Elisabeth launches at Pierre over their domestic roles. Some of the setups are wellorganised particularly when Vincent is about to reveal that name because it gives a preemptive feel to the chaos that is about to erupt. The weakness of the film is that despite the comedy revealing character and being purposeful as it should be there aren't a lot of big laughs. I think this has to do with the film's low energy levels. At just under two hours the film feels very long when this setup has been performed much leaner in the past. The Roman Polanski film Carnage from last year had a very similar premise but it was thirty minutes shorter and felt more satisfying. It was funnier and had more memorable episodes that I can still remember today. Nonetheless this is a comedy that is deceptively small and more layered and verbally articulate than a lot of mainstream comedies.".

He becomes a symbol for the ills of the factory and a radicalization process ensues until he is fired for taking a stand against the managers.Eventually rehired and given a demeaning assemblyline job he daydreams enviously of his friend in the madhouse.Gian Maria Volont gives the beleaguered hero a pathetic and comic dimension which is always convincing performing with bold strokes rather than by subtle illumination.  Petri's directorial technique uses a similar approach. A highlight is an uproarious scene of lovemaking in a Fiat with coworker Mieta Albertini.The film won the grand prize at Cannes in 1972.

	schema:headline " This is a politicallytinged existential drama par excellence";
	schema:reviewBody "A diligent bluecollar worker Lul Massa Gian Maria Volont is averse to rebellious fractions within his working place and students who express their resentment of overwhelming physical labour which Lul and coworkers are constrained to do in factories. Notwithstanding one day once he loses his finger in his factory and discerns the first symptoms of madness in his behaviour he becomes involved in protestations which the scathing board of directors frowns upon This is a politicallytinged existential drama par excellence which succeeds in being both insightful and poignant in its exploration of human condition in the Italian working class whose members are destined for solely biological existence. The stark portrayal of the pointlessness of life reminiscent of Woman in the Dunes 1964 by Hiroshi Teshigahara. Mr Petri whose political propensities are fully evident here passionately crafts this material and engrossingly displays the everyday dilemmas of physical labourers whose actions come to eating drinking and doing their work which is humiliatingly and moronically simple. The frequent juxtaposition of a man and a factory infuses into this film gloom and dreariness which is difficult to bear with. The indication that one might sweep away the meaningless of an individual only through sexual consolation is very disquieting and the depiction of the sombreness and the repetitiveness of each day of life solidifies the sepulchral tone. Just like Petri's earlier I giorni contati 1962 The Working Class Goes to Heaven is a blend of existentialism and neorealism polished to perfection in Petri's hands whose meticulous stylization renders the concept as sulky and austere as the sterile industrialized decor of Il deserto rosso 1964 by Michelangelo Antonioni. Lul Massa  the main character of this flick is the outcome of the mechanization of the unit whose productivity is the only value for his employer. Lul is the most assiduous worker which arouses abhorrence in his colleagues. He does not attach any great importance to his mental and physical health and he thinks that there is no big difference between dying in his factory and somewhere else. Initially he cannot comprehend why everybody is against him but once he accidentally loses his finger and notices that he embarks on following the lane of insanity through his obsessive demeanour towards order he regains his sight and perceives the world differently.Even though The Working Class Goes to Heaven is not as Kafkaesque as The Assassin 1961 and Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion 1970 it appears to refer to Kafka's short story A Report to an Academy which is about an ape which learns to behave like a human. During his visit in a mental institution where he meets a veteran exblue collar Militina Lul is shown an article from a newspaper which recounts a story of a chimpanzee which believes in its humanity. Petri seems to liken the Kafka's ape and Lul notwithstanding whilst the monkey from Kafka's tale obtains a new identity by approving of milieu repressing it and adjusting to its new entourage Lul Massa restores his personality on account of a calamity and the stifling milieu of his factory hence just like in case of Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion Mr Petri once again turns the world of Franz Kafka upside down.Besides dilating upon the harsh fate of the working class the director likewise hints at the exploitation of labourers from the povertypervaded southern Italy. Other Italian intelectualists such as Pier Paolo Pasolini also alluded to this phenomenon. Miseenscene by Elio Petri is exquisite and thoroughly unfaltering in its exposing the major concept. The resonance of his last acclaimed opus is indubitably enormous. Apart from delving in the issue of alienation and helplessness the highly flamboyant subplots reinforce the main theme and endow it with abundant background and owing to relatively deliberate pace the content is never lunged too hastily.The acting is simply excellent throughout the entire motion picture. Gian Maria Volont conveys to his role such a great portion of galvanizing rampage that he ravishes with his commitment to his part which might be one the most powerful in his utter career. There are other phenomenal performers in the cast such as facially distinctive Mariangela Melato Flavio Bucci and last but not least enthrallingly convincing Salvo Randone.The subsidiary cinematography by Luigi Kuveiller is obviously a determinant of quality but what emerges from his beauteous takes of impoverished flats of physical workers is the mutual sway between Bertolucci and Petri. Bernardo Bertolucci conceded his fascination with merging existentialism and neorealism in I giorni contati by Petri and Petri seemed to be enchanted by the lighting and visual aspect in The Conformist 1970 which was visible in the case of The Working Class Goes to Heaven. The shots of indigent flats framed with gleams of blue radiance constitute a chilly bitter aftertaste which exerts a beneficial impact on the other ingredients. The symbiotic soundtrack by Ennio Morricone is one of the most idiosyncratic elements and the flick would feel totally different with a distinct piece of music from another composer. Mr Morricone provides us with one of his most unusual and characteristic creations which is rapid aggressive contextualises with the ensemble absolutely perfectly and reverberates like a genuine machine.Though the movie overzealously strives to inculcate Marxist doctrines in its viewers and Petri's appeal to social alignment is displayed here it does not modify the fact that it is an exceedingly significant film which has to be analysed discussed and considered to be a major motion picture which auspiciously encases the atmosphere of those days filled with protestations but also exhibits a timeless struggle of a man attempting to retain dignity despite difficult living conditions and tough work.".

The dirty and denatured cinematography by Luigi Kuvellier the monotonous and dreary production design by the future Academy Awards winner Dante Ferretti and the repetitive and disturbing score by Ennio Morricone help to build the alienating life of a worker in a big inhuman factory.

	schema:headline " The Workers control the means of cutting their fingers off";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is both fantasy and complete reality at the same time. Gian Marie Volonte plays an extremely efficient worker doing piecework in a factory not even sure what the parts he produces are used for. At the same time Volonte's precise rhythm and total concentration make him an object of hate amongst his fellow workers all of him are continually time managed by snidey supervisors who mostly hide behind a yellow screen in an observation box. A large hand index finger pointing down oppressively is printed on the wall above the workers.Volonte is a good worker but not good at anything else. His son lives with his exwife and fellow worker. He can't get it up for his girlfriend and her little boy spends his time totally consumed by television. Exhausted from working all day Volonte's only break from routine is to visit and colleague who has ended up in an asylum.

I'm guessing that might be part of intention of the film to a certain extent. With the loss of the finger Volonte loses his urge to be the best worker and starts to see how his life in the factory may not be a life at all but all those folk screaming about smashing the system or how unity can get better rights are they any less selfserving than those in charge at the factory?Petri does everything he can to make the factory look like some sort of prison continually filming through bars and even doing the same thing later with a school. Ennio Morricone's soundtrack also enforces the idea of some kind of industrial trap where the self is wiped away in place of production. The film is run down and grey on purpose but there are a few bits of Petri's weird visuals here and there  like the strange diagram Volonte faces while getting psychologically tested.The main reason for watching this is for Gian Marie Volonte who comes across as a guy who isn't that smart a man who makes an arse of everything and in losing the only thing he was good at starts unravelling. In the Italian language version you can hear how fragile and hysterical Volonte sounds. He seems to mess up just about every conversation and even when he thinks he's made the wrong choice it dawns on him that he's not the only one that's shallow.Good film this. Nearly two hours long though!".

	onyx:emotionText "This film is both fantasy and complete reality at the same time. Gian Marie Volonte plays an extremely efficient worker doing piecework in a factory not even sure what the parts he produces are used for. At the same time Volonte's precise rhythm and total concentration make him an object of hate amongst his fellow workers all of him are continually time managed by snidey supervisors who mostly hide behind a yellow screen in an observation box. A large hand index finger pointing down oppressively is printed on the wall above the workers.Volonte is a good worker but not good at anything else. His son lives with his exwife and fellow worker. He can't get it up for his girlfriend and her little boy spends his time totally consumed by television. Exhausted from working all day Volonte's only break from routine is to visit and colleague who has ended up in an asylum. Soon enough Volonte begins to think that what this man is saying is making sense...Outside the factory radical communists screams slogans through megaphones and clash with the unions as the workers trudge in to start their shift.

	schema:reviewBody "Lulu the Tool is yet another film that I watched because I loved Morricone's background score.Lulu Gian Maria Volante is an efficient worker at a factory. His coworkers hate him because of his productive abilities. The radical communists at the factory gates try to get Lulu to join them to save the workers from exploitation by the factory's management. But Lulu is proud of his productive skills he even brags to his wife that his body is like a machine. But one day Lulu gets his finger chopped off in an industrial accident. Depressed and overworked he decides to join the radical communists who want to destroy the system. This puts him at odds not just with the factory's management but also the union who seeks not to destroy the system but better pay and working conditions for the workers. Lulu also visits a mental asylum where he talks to a former factory worker who is completely cuckoo.While the film does underscore the plight of the workers the film is not simply communist propaganda. The futility of labor. The futility of revolution. The position of the individual in a demeaning job as a factory worker and in a revolution where he has to suppress his individual desires for the good of his comrades. These are some of the themes that the director Elio Petri tackles in this powerful film. The radical communists are portrayed as ridiculous with their loud speakers yelling propaganda into workers ears as they make their way into the factory. Petri himself was an excommunist.The scenes at the factory have a manic and stylish quality about them with the workers and managers yelling at each other. These scenes are set to Morricone's pounding score in the background I wonder whether the makers of Blue Collar were inspired by this score. The score is used to great effect in the factory and protest scenes. It has a very edgy proletarian quality and its impact is tremendous as the film builds up towards a frenzied ending.Volante is sensational  what a transformation after playing the devious villains of Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion Fistfull of Dollars and Luckily Luciano. He evokes pity and a few chuckles as a crummy and loud mouthed working class slob.Despite the heavy subject material Lulu the Tool is a very entertaining and stylish film.910".

Lulu prides himself on being a productive worker and the bosses praise him for his almost superhuman devotion to work. In spite of that Lulu is just another worker scraping a meager job living in a crummy apartment with a woman he doesn't love very much. His personal life seems to amount to visiting a former work mate who's now living in a mental hospital.Lulu's outlook however changes when he loses a finger in a factory accident. Although the accident doesn't leave him disabled it makes him spin out of his numb existence as he gets more interested in the unions' struggles. But if before he was indifferent now he starts getting involved with radical extremists preaching a new social revolution instead of the more moderate but realistic unions.The movie is interesting because of the way it portrays the schism between unions on the one hand there's the traditional union composed of workers who just want to improve their lot get a payrise. And then there are the MarxistLeninist students and intellectual nutjobs who never put a foot inside a factory and who want to blow society up and rebuild it from the ashes. Petri is deservedly critical of the latter.The movie shares similarities with neorealist cinema in the way it portrays the squalor and working conditions of ordinary people but Petri isn't particularly soft on the working class. Their inability to get organised their own selfishness and the lack of credible leaders to inspire them is nicely dealt with in here. The viewer expecting just propaganda will be disappointed.Gian Maria Volente delivers a fine performance especially in his mad outbursts of rage and madness. Petri has directed better movies but The Working Class Goes to Heaven manages to tackle many of the issues in his oeuvre and so is also an indispensable movie for fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rene Soutendijk plays her first leading role as a young law student who joins the Dutch resistance in WWII and trains to be a liquidator. Having already garnered attention the year before in Paul Verhoeven's controversial Spetters Soutendijk decided to leave the sitcom Zeg 'ns Aaa wich had not yet found a big audience to concentrate on a career in film rather than television. The movie was shot to resemble black and white pictures from the period and looks suitably bleak and gray making the lead characters's red hair stand out even more. Eventually circumstances force her to dye it it made her the most recognizable resistance fighter and at that point both the story and the film seem to lose all color. Not that there was anything to laugh about in the first place.Debutant director and cowriter Ben Verbong decided to omit any references to Jannetje Johanna Schaft the girl with the red hair being a communist even though that was one of the main reasons for her to join the resistance. There is hardly any dialog anyway as none of the group members want too much emotional attachments. Even when she get romantically involved with fellow resistance fighter Hugo they never seem especially passionate. The sparseness of the spoken word makes this picture seem even more like a psychological study of the lengths people will go to in desperate times as we watch the title character struggle with becoming a hit woman on a bicycle.Although the film is certainly well made and Soutendijk proves to be a capable lead there is absolutely nothing uplifting in the entire picture. The combination of long silent scenes and colorless photography makes for quite a depressive sitting. The period is recreated in great detail with only Loes Luca's different hairstyles seeming to be a little out of place at times.

	onyx:emotionText "Rene Soutendijk plays her first leading role as a young law student who joins the Dutch resistance in WWII and trains to be a liquidator. Having already garnered attention the year before in Paul Verhoeven's controversial Spetters Soutendijk decided to leave the sitcom Zeg 'ns Aaa wich had not yet found a big audience to concentrate on a career in film rather than television. The movie was shot to resemble black and white pictures from the period and looks suitably bleak and gray making the lead characters's red hair stand out even more. Eventually circumstances force her to dye it it made her the most recognizable resistance fighter and at that point both the story and the film seem to lose all color. Not that there was anything to laugh about in the first place.Debutant director and cowriter Ben Verbong decided to omit any references to Jannetje Johanna Schaft the girl with the red hair being a communist even though that was one of the main reasons for her to join the resistance. There is hardly any dialog anyway as none of the group members want too much emotional attachments. Even when she get romantically involved with fellow resistance fighter Hugo they never seem especially passionate. The sparseness of the spoken word makes this picture seem even more like a psychological study of the lengths people will go to in desperate times as we watch the title character struggle with becoming a hit woman on a bicycle.Although the film is certainly well made and Soutendijk proves to be a capable lead there is absolutely nothing uplifting in the entire picture. The combination of long silent scenes and colorless photography makes for quite a depressive sitting. The period is recreated in great detail with only Loes Luca's different hairstyles seeming to be a little out of place at times. Verbong and Soutendijk teamed up again in 1994 for the Sliver like thriller 'De Flat'. This marked Rene's return to Dutch films after a stint in Hollywood and Verbong's goodbye from his homeland as he decided to move to Germany after wards.7 out of 10";

It does leave out the Communism part of the story but it wasn't as important as the other writer suggests. Hannie became a communist after she joined the group it wasn't her motive for joining. She joined the communist group because they were the one of the few groups that took up arms and allowed women to fight as well. But yes it is a shame that this didn't make the story. I also would have liked to see more about the Versteegsisters their story is as interesting perhaps even more then Hannies story. What upsets me is that Hannies last words were not in the movie. According to those who were there at the time Hannie was shot once but not killed right away. She then remarked I shoot better then you before being killed with a machine gun.Still a great movie cheaper and older then Black Book Zwartboek by Paul Verhoeven but a LOT better and MUCH more authentic.".

That's me and movies. I yell at the characters. Anyway it is a true historical story of a dark time during war in the 1940s. The ending is quite sad though as the girl gets murdered two weeks before the end of the war even after trying all these ways to stay out of the hands of the police for murdering traitors. i highly suggest this movie. don't worry its not just another war movie. it has an interesting plot and its not too hard to understand.".

	schema:reviewBody "Feminism must not have been very strong in 1981 in the Netherlands if this film gained any popular acclaim there. I say this because the girl with the red hair Hannie Schaft an actual member of the Dutch Resistance to German occupation in World War II isn't favorably depicted. She is shown as constantly conflicted about and uncomfortable with her resistance work doesn't do any of it well and repeatedly fails. Thus she is just what we would expect from a fragile female trying to perform men's workthe exact stereotype that the real Hannie Schaft struggled so much against. Therefore if this film ever played well with Dutch audiences it could only have been because the filmmakers managed to elicit sympathy for the protagonist by making her every bit as weak and uncertain as they imagined the women in the audience to be. But in reality people who take on dangerous espionage sabotage and assassination work or join the militaryand who stay with it any length of timearen't like the rest of us. They gain a toughness and skill which allows them to succeed as the real Hannie Schaft didenough to make the German occupiers want her dead even as the war was ending. Moreover this film is historically superficial in its treatment of Schaft failing completely to cover or even mention her sabotage work or include her famous partnership with the Oversteegen sisters the very resistance fighters who helped immortalize her after the war.".

	schema:reviewBody "I bought this DVD in the cheap bin just to see Charlotte Church. I am a big fan of her singing and I figured it would be worth 5 to see her in this. What I got was a bigger very pleasant surprise. This is a nice romantic comedy with welldrawn characters. Plus young Charlotte shows that she is a very good natural actress. And she even does a bit of singing.The main character is played by Craig Ferguson. He is Paul Kerr an apparently washedup alcoholic rock musician. At the beginning we see him in a sad state riding his off road motorbike inside his house up the stairs and right out the window and into the fountain below. In split screen we see young Olivia Charlotte Church practicing a hymn in church with her voice coach contrasting the lives of Olivia and Paul. This is important as the story develops.Jemma Redgrave plays Olivia's mum Rebecca. She and a partner run a hair styling business and Rebecca expects her daughter Olivia to join her in the business after she finishes school. But Olivia has no interest in that she loves to sing.So this movie is about the various characters mending their attitudes and healing old hurts. It is very well done a very enjoyable movie that never gets dull. Charlotte sings a bit but only a bit.SPOILERS FOLLOW. We find out that Paul is really Olivia's father and this all comes to light after Paul's fall with everyone fearing he will die. But he is not badly injured. Still they think he may be suicidal so he is put into a mental ward. Friends pretend to be his family get him out but an old musician friend and reformed alcoholic shows up to help Paul kick his habit. In the process he finds out that not only does he have a daughter but she sings beautifully. Mum was been upset for 16 years because none of her letters were ever answered but Paul found out that his manager never gave any of them to him. Long story short Paul stays sober he and Rebecca realize they have always loved each other Olivia gets to go to London and study singing.".

This family drama musical was a unique fusion of genres that took itself seriously. Mr. Ferguson's performance in contrast to his talk show host persona was not in evidence two years earlier and is a testament to his acting ability to portray a different character without the character types that often slip into an actor's roles on screen.What makes this movie stand out is its integrity and commitment to developing its characters and storyline with more passion and depth creating a substantive and compelling movie that sustains a level of interpersonal complexity and tension that is usually reserved for quality movies and avoided by lowbudget knock offs. While perhaps the storyline isn't very original the script does an amazing job of fleshing out both the drama as well as the humorcomedy that never reaches the slapstick dumbdowned comedy of mindless stand up comedy. The musical renditions are powerful and the beginning split between two musical scenes is an amazing and captivating opening and quickly captures the audiences attention with emotion.If one attends to this movie carefully Ferguson has crafted this movie with excellent editing unique use of split screen and the interweaving of music with the storyline. The cinematography is actually some of the most well designed and the camera work nicely composed. It's really an amazing piece of work that balances wit drama and family entertainment.In a number of ways this is a family version of Moulin Rouge for young adults and it contains relevant themes for today's contemporary society that both can resonate for juveniles and parents alike.".

	schema:reviewBody "Grace Slick lead singer of the Jefferson Airplane once said in an interview that there was something pathetic about 50yearolds playing rock and roll. Grace should rent THIS film if for no other reason than to see Joss Ackland as Evil Edmonds and his geriatric band the BeeLzeeBOPS prove you're NEVER too old to rock. I've been a fan of Ferguson since his days on the Drew Carey Show and enjoyed his two previous films which he also cowrote. Somehow I missed this one until recently which is a shame since it's also his directorial debut. Much has been written about the film as a Charlotte Church vehicle which it really isn't. What it IS is a heartwarming family dramacomedymusical about lost  refound love personal redemption family values and friendship. Ferguson who also wrote the screenplay uses his own personal experiences as an 80's rocker and alcoholic to inform his story without descending into mawkish sentimentality.Here Be Spoilers The story revolves around Ferguson's Paul Kerr an 80's rocker on the downside drinking his way into oblivion. After a drunken motorcycle accident lands him in the psych ward under suicide watch he finds out he has a daughter named Olivia he never knew about played quite winningly by Ms. Church from a onenightstand that he never forgot. This revelation along with the arrival of his former bandmate and drummer help him to quit drinking and begin to forge a relationship with his daughter both as a father and as a musician. This also allows him to finally reconnect with Olivia's mother played quite well by Jemma Redgrave while helping her to see her child's enormous gift and realize that he really HAS always loved only her. Toss in Joss Ackland's bravura performance as Olivia's Granddad the aforementioned Evil Edmonds an older crustier notsosuccessful version of Kerr and you have the basic family. Add a great supporting cast of characters a great screenplay that shows the humanity OF those characters and great singing from Church and what more do you need? Ferguson's Kerr as the little boy who never had to grow up stepping up as both a father and ultimately lover is dead on. Redgrave's Rebecca strikes the perfect tone showing her bitterness and anger towards Kerr as well as her vulnerability and love for her daughter. Church is a natural as Olivia who loves her mother dearly but has music in her bones a fact seen by Kerr Evil Edmonds and ultimately by Rebecca herself.So it ain't War and Peace. It's merely an excellent family movie which places it head and shoulders above the usual pedestrian family fare. THAT credit goes to writerdirector Craig Ferguson. Bravissimo Craig. See this movie. You'll laugh you'll cry. you'll sing along. If it can warm the heart of a jaded soul like me then it ought to warm yours as well.".

Ferguson who also wrote the screenplay uses his own personal experiences as an 80's rocker and alcoholic to inform his story without descending into mawkish sentimentality.Here Be Spoilers The story revolves around Ferguson's Paul Kerr an 80's rocker on the downside drinking his way into oblivion. After a drunken motorcycle accident lands him in the psych ward under suicide watch he finds out he has a daughter named Olivia he never knew about played quite winningly by Ms. Church from a onenightstand that he never forgot. This revelation along with the arrival of his former bandmate and drummer help him to quit drinking and begin to forge a relationship with his daughter both as a father and as a musician. This also allows him to finally reconnect with Olivia's mother played quite well by Jemma Redgrave while helping her to see her child's enormous gift and realize that he really HAS always loved only her. Toss in Joss Ackland's bravura performance as Olivia's Granddad the aforementioned Evil Edmonds an older crustier notsosuccessful version of Kerr and you have the basic family. Add a great supporting cast of characters a great screenplay that shows the humanity OF those characters and great singing from Church and what more do you need? Ferguson's Kerr as the little boy who never had to grow up stepping up as both a father and ultimately lover is dead on. Redgrave's Rebecca strikes the perfect tone showing her bitterness and anger towards Kerr as well as her vulnerability and love for her daughter. Church is a natural as Olivia who loves her mother dearly but has music in her bones a fact seen by Kerr Evil Edmonds and ultimately by Rebecca herself.So it ain't War and Peace. It's merely an excellent family movie which places it head and shoulders above the usual pedestrian family fare. THAT credit goes to writerdirector Craig Ferguson. Bravissimo Craig. See this movie. You'll laugh you'll cry. you'll sing along. If it can warm the heart of a jaded soul like me then it ought to warm yours as well.";

I didn't realize it was Charlotte Church until the credits rolled. She stopped my 8 yr old girl in her tracks and she started watched when Charlotte sang at the Royal Academy scene. I really enjoyed the movie. Having watched his show for some time now it was easy to see the parallels he drew from his own life drinking sobriety music etc. The scene in which the two former band mates where joking about his wife's name being Nessie and they lived in Loch Ness..you could tell they were having a ball when they filmed it. The music scenes where a bit stiff for Craig and the fatherinlaw.".

And will Olivia be able to pursue a future that makes use of her stunning voice? This is a nice film in many ways. Church is great as the teenager and her voice is beyond compare.

Most important the message of forgiveness resounds throughout the movie a message that is needed by everyone.

I don't think it is so  Ostrov it's rather a testimony for those interested about the Russian soul which is deeply religious and rooted in Orthodox Christianity. I think the main target of the movie were the Russian themselves or maybe by extension those nations who are traditionally Orthodox Christian but forgot their roots.The movie tries to bring into attention the essence of Orthodox Christian belief  the reunification of man with God which is done through repentance and unceased prayer in humbleness and ascetic struggle. According to the same beliefs God is the one who works this union in cooperation with the man.The main character Fr. Anatoli was inspired from the lives of some Russian fools for Christ  men who tried to hide their sanctity and keep their humbleness behind a mask of apparent insanity  especially from the life of St. Theophile the Fool for Christ.I think the success gained by this movie in Russia and beyond is determined by the inner identification of the viewer with the concepts revealed in it.Nevertheless beside it's religious significance Ostrov has a brilliant image directing with superb shots of the remote locations and a very good and balanced script  even a surprising final turnaround for those who may have felt the need for it. You may think of it in a way as a sort of fictional documentary.As a final note I think the movie requires at least a second viewing both for deepening and reenjoying it.".

At first I thought it was one of those we are the best the usual Russian things. Not so. It is still the 1 feature in Russian movie theaters at the time of this writing. Anyway Russians don't wait as long as Americans do before they release a movie to the television. And so today they did the movie is still in the theaters and is doing really good at the box office. Don't know how exactly it works in Russia. But anyway the movie is SO GOOD! It is definitely up there with Bergman and Tarkovsky. It is simply spectacular! Don't even think of missing it! Everything is great about this movie. The story is really short to get you into the mood in the orgasmic kind of way and it will keep you at the edge of your sit to the very last second. Beautiful actors. The film is shot in beautiful widescreen  an absolutely breathtaking cinematography. The only thing bad about this movie is that it is too short!!!! Don't get me wrong it is a fulllength film but it's ended just a couple of hours earlier than I expected  Just watch it! You will not regret it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some scenes in this film have an almost Bergmanlike quality to them. I had anticipated that somehow the clergy depicted would be subjected to at least subtle ridicule which has become common practice in most films produced in the West. Refreshingly this was not the case. I had never suspected that a work of such spiritual dynamism could arise so soon from the ashes of the Soviet Union. The main characters were presented as spiritually honest people who consciously struggled with their human weaknesses. The presentation of Russian Orthodox monastic practice was quite intriguing and instructive. A second viewing of the film clarifies some of Fr. Anatoly's peculiar behavior which proves to be clairvoyant. The movie also is available on DVD with English subtitles. Currently you will need a DVD player that plays all regions to view. Maybe someday this film will be dubbed in English which would make this excellent work available to a wider audience.".

From cinematography composition of scenes scenery philosophical messages religious messages and the good side of humanity are all absolutely prefect beyond any description. The slow pacing and monochrome colours adds to the high level of religious message and spirituality. The most thought provoking scene is when Father Anatoli curses the devils therefore helping his senior Father Filaret to achieve a higher level of spirituality. The ending is deeply affecting and it is almost impossible not to be touched to tears. My friends and I were deep in thoughts for an hour after the film finished.

And the whiteblack image transform the picture in more veridical story. Maybe only Andrei Rubliov equal this picture. In this picture we will see the difference between the oriental people who believe in Iisus Hristos who is the head of the orthodox church and occidental people who does not go to pray the God in church and they will be only a good citizen. I understand the fact Piotr Mamonov after this picture he go to a monastery and suffer a total transformation. I believe maybe I am wrong only people and only the orthodox who lived in communism understood the real message of this picture nothing is possible without God and Iisus Hristos and the world is full of sacraments.

But then I began to see that Father Anatoly has found favor with God and he is a lot more sensitive to His will than an average person. It was God's perfect will to bring it to this kind of completion. We never hear back from the people who were helped by Father Anatoly. That calls for our faith that things for them worked out the way he said that they will. I can't help but wonder if the widow made it to France if the boy's leg healed if the young girl's baby turned out to be a 'golden boy'. What is going to happen to Father Job? He wanted 'to serve people' but complains that it was not given to him. Is he going to step up after Father Anatoly's death? This movie is a kind that stays with you for life.

Yet the habitat is only a backdrop of the story and not once directly mentioned just as air and earth are not mentioned in other stories. Both the faith and the environs are always present yet the former is what everyone aware of the latter is almost ignored.In a land of unacknowledged yet unsparing harshness and unquestioned faith the one who is abjectly faithful is the giant. Despite his uncouth ways and almost insane behavior Father Anatoly towers above the other monks because his faith is complete. His submission to his god is total. Not a shred of vacillation not an inkling of doubt. The other monks with all the trappings and tinsels of organized religion fear him for the reason. They try disciplining him. But how does one tame a person by punishments when he is burning from within from the awareness of his own sins. They even try mocking his funny ways. But how do you shame someone who is so sure of his crazy beliefs. He seems to be living a spiritual life his own at the periphery of the monastery. He seems to be aware of something beyond what other monks follow pedantically and ritually. They submit to him for there was not much else they could do. He cares naught for their submission because even their submission is a distraction from his own journey of expiation.I confess as I watched the movie I felt ashamed of the comfort that I live in. I confess that I became acutely aware of my faithlessness. Then I consoled myself that if one must be faithful it has to be to the degree of Father Anatoly's. Any less it would dissipate like an snowflake touched by sun. Unfaith accepts fractions faith brooks none. So I return to my shameless existence having unburdened myself of the momentary guilt.".

	schema:reviewBody "Producerstar Helen Gardner has doubtless seen the Italian Quo Vadis and this Cleopatra runs an amazing 90 minutes for a 1912 feature with 106 title cards!  Cleopatra is a case of trial and discovery in this exploratory era of American features.  The first hour is filmed in the static Film d'Art style save for one brief insert added probably very late in the production and the modern viewer begins to wish that the camera were moved even just a bit closer to the stagebound action despite the elaborate if somewhat primitive stage dressing.  In the last third of Cleopatra more shots and setups are used by far than in the first two thirds.  We also find the camera is moving closer to the actors and less of a concern is shown towards exposing the sets costumes and extras resulting in an entirely more satisfying and intimate cinematic experience though some of this section of the film is choppy in the GEH print aired on TCM.  My feeling is that Cleopatra is a textbook example of how featurelength filmmaking helped open up possibilities towards a more sophisticated style of onscreen direction cutting and camera setups. Gardner  co. are literally discovering as they go and it seems much of Cleopatra was filmed in story sequence.  By shooting using gradually smaller parts of the set and closer to the actors Gardner created a film that had considerably more dramatic power in the end result than was generally required by 1912 standards and on this alone the film remains a genuine stepforward for the fledgling American feature industry.".

Although I think they did a beautiful job on the restoration I found the new avantgarde soundtrack too invasive and distracting.  In fact I had to watch it with the mute on.Having said that though I did find this adaptation interesting.  It is true that like many films of this era it is a bit creaky and primitive. However it provides a fascinating glimpse of early filmmakingno closeups the camera hardly ever moves etc.  I also found Ms. Gardener fascinating given how much of the production was actually done by her including costume design.  I wish there were more information available on her life and career.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm amazed to see a 1912 feature that's almost 90 minutes long. By contrast From the Manger to the Cross is under 70 min. The tinting and restoration are good the modern music by Chantal Kreviazuk is interesting if unnecessary there's no reason to be turned off by ityou can always play your own music!. The film is not in pure tableau style but in modified tableaus. That is there is some crosscutting from different locations and dialogue cards do interrupt the shots. The first scene is even somewhat distracting in its cutaways to a man who is a short distance away. During the battle of Actium the camera suddenly goes in for a series of near closeups of Cleopatra and Antony from the waist up and the entire scene is told in these alternating shots with captions. A way to avoid staging a battle. The scene in which she barges down the Nile and seduces Antony is a typical example of film d'art tableau style with only dialogue interrupting the shot occasionally. The major lengthy sequence at the end however begins in two locations in Cleo's chamber on an upper floor and outside on the ground below and Antony is raised up through the window on a rope then for the rest of the complex scene the camera pans right and left as called for by the action. Fascinating and typically noble.".

	schema:reviewBody "Quite a remarkable production a key film on the continuum of American film that set the bar higher. Considering King Tut's tomb wouldn't be found for another ten years the sets and costumes were well done funny chubby Egyptian figures painted on the walls. Thank goodness D.W. Griffith was compelled to innovate a few years later but restoration funds were well spent on this historical film.Cleopatra is a very stagey film. Nothing happens here that could not happen in a theatre. Genuine exteriors are almost nonexistent and even simple exteriors requiring only a field and a tree or two are duplicated with backdrops. This of course was in an era when the theatre still commanded a good deal more respect than did the cinema. Remember that one of the earliest film companies a precursor to Paramount was originally formed by Zukor as Famous Players in Famous Plays. Also note that the extras seem to have nothing really to do. They are all standing around seeming to look for direction. Most of the film is very long shots once again going back to theatre roots. The score is terrible and does not fit the film at all. I don't care for avantgarde stuff and the music definitely falls into that category. If someone were going to use that type of music I would think it would be better suited to something like a German expressionist style film not a period piece historical type film. That noise Ms. Gardner Cleopatra was making at the beginning was just odd and distracting. Then the actual singing if you can call it that because the words were pretty much unintelligible was again distracting. I was trying to figure out what she was saying and ended up missing part of the movie. Howeverthe sounds and the score is somebody in modern times trying to augment the film so I can hardly blame Ms.Gardner for it one hundred years after the fact.I'm glad this film was restored as it's an interesting piece of film history. Before the money men got involved there was a place for women behind the camera in writing and directing as well as owning their own studios as Helen Gardner did. It's also very interesting that she made many feature length films 8090 minutes as opposed to the one and two reelers of the time. Cleopatra is listed as being the first feature length film 6 reels made in the U.S. although De Mille always incorrectly tried to claim that The Squaw Man  which he directed was the first feature length film.Worthwhile for the novelty of it all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Good but not great.  Like some of the other commentors I saw this on TCM with the new music soundtrack.  Unlike many I liked the new music.  Since this film is so dated the music freshens it up a little.  It's really more effective as a time capsule rather than as a drama.  The star Helen Gardner also produced so this is her vision.

Since this film is so dated the music freshens it up a little.  It's really more effective as a time capsule rather than as a drama.  The star Helen Gardner also produced so this is her vision.

After all as a retired history teacher the film is a mess and creates a ridiculous image of Cleopatra which history cannot support. Imagine...in this film she is SO seductive and beautiful that a lowly fisherman agrees to kill himself after they complete a short love affair! And imagine that the mere sight of her compels people to destroy their lives! That's the Cleopatra of this filman almost complete fiction created by French playwright Victorien Sardou.The reason I STILL think it's worthwhile is the historical context for when the film was made. It was 1912and a feature length film in America might be 20 or 30 minutes maxyet here we have a costume drama lasting nearly 90 minutes. And although there's a bit of overacting here and there the film is reasonably well directed by Charles Gaskill. Worth seeing as a curio at leasteven if the story is pretty crappy.".

I'm sure that some viewers will be turned off by this since the singer and the song sound rather out of place at first simply because they are unexpected and a surprise. Not everyone likes a surprise especially when it's applied to something they think should be maintained in total integrity with the original presentation.My personal view is that these early silent films were meant to be supported by the best efforts of musicians available at the time to add their own personal interpretation to the film and to support the film with appropriate artistic sound to help convey the viewer into a more complete sensory experience. I know there are some musicians who could provide an accompaniment that would sound more like a 1912 accompaniment but I liked what the musicians did with this film. I added to my enjoyment and brought me more emotionally into the whole story.The film itself is an excellent example of how pure acting together with simple sets and costumes can by itself bring a good story to life for a viewer. It helps to have one of the greatest love stories of all time as the subject matter. And the fact that almost everyone has some level of familiarity with the story as originally written for the stage by the greatest playwright Wm.

However what makes the movie unbearable for me to watch is the really bad sound track that accompanies it bongo drums off screen chanting etc. An organ score would have been sufficient. Presented in correct silent film speed Cleopatra plays at 90 minutes but again complaining about the score made it seem like it runs at 190 minutes. Cleopatra was obviously filmed in a studio sound stage with backdrops moving about like a painted curtain. Had it been done a few years later under the direction of DW Griffith then possibly it would have become a masterpiece as his 1916 production of INTOLERANCE.

As producer I appreciate what she was trying to do in forming her own production company and to elevate the nascent art form by attempting a more substantial film. As Cleopatra it's an exaggerated performance that hasn't aged all that well but I loved her slow sensuousness and how she presents a view beauty different from the ones we're so regularly bombarded with. My favorite moment was when she shimmied closer and closer to the camera in a seductive dance helping out the static camera view. I also liked the sexual daring of the slave subplot early on where she spares a slave from death so that he might join her as a lover for ten nights after which she expects him to drink poison and die apparently this faced censorship in some places. Lastly Helen Gardner as costume designer produced a wardrobe that may not come across as lavish as films even a decade or two later Claudette Colbert wearing Travis Banton's costumes for the 1934 version comes to mind but they were interesting and beautiful.Unfortunately the film shows its age and lags with a slow pace common to the period starting at about the 30 minute point with the meeting between Cleo and Marc Antony which lasts about 10 minutes. You'll definitely have to put yourself into 1912 mode if you want to make it through the hour and half. The camera is set up as if this was the theater and director Charles L. Gaskill was simply filming a stageplay. There are no montage sequences tracking shots or even closeups. I think there may have been just one very slow pan and it's no wonder actors from the period exaggerated their emotions and body movements. The script also suffers from giving the slave character Pharon much too big a role. Don't watch it for a history lesson either although it tells us it's going to take liberties up front.As for the controversial modern soundtrack which also annoys many viewers overall I thought it fit the emotions and breathed some life into a creaky old film. The two points at which lyrics are sung seemed a little off for a silent film but I appreciated how brave the choice was and found myself liking it.".

Compare this film to D.W.Griffith's BIRTH OF A NATION only three years to see what a revolution occurred in cinematic technique.

Of course as any seasoned Euroexploitation fan knows it is very rare that ANY socalled video nasty lives up to the promise of its garish title and plot outline and in practice there is nothing that displays this more succinctly than this genre.  The Nazisex films are ineptly made dull boring and not nearly as offensive as they should be.Saying that though THE BEAST IN HEAT does at least enough to raise itself above other dross such as SS EXPERIMENT CAMP.  Badly made and boring it might be but the comedy of the caged beast is enough to keep you watching even though its appearances are few and far between.  The nastiest gore surfaces at the very end and although it's all quite unpleasant in theory particularly the moment where the beast tears chunks out of an unfortunate victim's mons pubis and gobbles them up the absolutely dire standard of special effects leaves this whole affair more in the niche of BLOODSUCKING FREAKS than MEN BEHIND THE SUN...Not really worth bothering with unless you are an enthusiast of this sort of thing.  Fans of this particularly surreal thread of exploitation would be well advised to dabble in the seedy climes of the closelyrelated Women In Prison cycle because the best of that genre beats this type of gubbins hands down.".

	schema:reviewBody "I jotted down some notes about Luigi Baztella's BEAST IN HEAT which is easily the cumulative apex of both the Italian Nazi Exploitation idiom and Euro War subgenres all wrapped up into one1 The movie is an exercise in applied bad taste ranking up there with Umberto Lenzi's CANNIBAL FEROX or maybe PAINT YOUR WAGON as one of the silliest movies ever made about a potentially serious subject. Anyone who is offended by it is too stupid for their own good and I wonder how they might get through the day without hurting themselves or accidentally blowing something up.2 During WW2 there was apparently an ultrasecret Nazi medical experiments division headed by outrageously sexy female bisexual dominatrix type Gruppenfuhrers here personified by the undeniably arousing Macha Magall in grave need of a proper spanking for being so naughty who looked great strutting around in Nazi regalia and spent many hours perfecting the act of crossing  uncrossing their garterhose encased legs sexually harassing their subordinates and sucking on phallic cigarette holders. We are lucky we won.3 The star of the film is Monkeyboy veteran character actor Salvatore Baccaro who was able to convincingly play simian characters without any special makeup or costuming a name given by one of my drinking buddies to the half ape half man crossbreed creature injected with a serum that enhances it's libido to the point where the thing just exists to hump whatever females are thrown into it's cage. The Nazis then stand around and watch the proceedings while taking notes. Just what they hope to achieve by this experiment  and just how they cross bred an ape with a human so quickly  is sadly never addressed during the film's duration.4 The movie is actually 2 or 3 or 4 movies edited down into about 85 minutes of screen time. The most watchable segments of Mr. Batzella's truly awful 1970 Euro War failure WHEN THE BELL TOLLS with Brad 'Zambo' Harris are combined with newsreel and stolen war movie footage to pad out the approximately 40 minutes of stock exposed for the principal action of the film. Harris must have taken a swing at Mr. Batzella after being informed he was included in this film  viewing the results and be sure to check out how one character's hair style and costuming changes between scenes taken from one or the other project. Seven years really is a long time.5 Nazi storm troopers often amused themselves by tossing babies into the air for target practice with their Italian made Baretta machine guns. They may have been evil dirtbags but they knew a good time when they saw it and managed to find a few laughs in between extermination roundups where the first thing they would do would be to separate out all of the young hotties to be molested by their lesbian dominatrix Gruppenfuhrers. Talk about rank having it's privileges.6 The film is an extension of the Italian Euro War agenda of painting the Italians not as Nazi collaborators who eventually wizened up but as the Good Guys. This is done not by depicting their own story of coming around to the program of stopping totalitarianism but by painting the Nazis as the most evil vile depraved menace possible with one War Is Hell sequence after the other. The Italians may have been bad but they weren't as bad as the Nazis and this movie is part of their proof.7 Guinea pigs will consume the intestines of attractive Italian B movie actresses when placed on their abdomens.8 Monkeyboy totally rulez this movie and his climactic encounter with Macha Magall has a kind of Hitchcockian inevitability to it that wraps everything up. The best way to watch BEAST IN HEAT is to glom onto the DVD version so you can fastforward through the filler material and concentrate on the scenes of Nazi depravity  which is the whole reason to watch it in the first place  since the history being depicted is about as realistic as a Three Stooges short. A Cliffnotes version of BEAST IN HEAT should be executed distilling the film down to it's core 40 minutes of nonstop hilarity.9 The main reason that the Nazi Exploitation idiom is viewed with such disdain is due to the subject matter which many have deigned to be sacred. The Video Nasty label wasn't applied here so much for gruesomeness or sexualized content but for the attitude of daring not to take the subject of Nazi war atrocities with the seriousness it is due. And it bears repeating again that anyone who is offended by this movie is probably a moron for having chosen to watch a movie called SS HELL CAMP it in the first place. If you want to watch something serious about Nazi atrocities dial up the History Channel next time for Pete's sake.In closing someone whom I discussed this film with asked me if I actually thought what was being shown really happened and my immediate reply was of course it was all real. Just like FARENHEIT 911 or AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH here is one of the great documentaries of all time proving once and for all that Italian genre cinema is a fool's paradise. It may not be very well made or pack a social wallop but it sure is a hell of a lot of fun when consumed in the presence of your friends with plenty of beer.310".

So the idea is that they throw any girl who doesn't collaborate into his cage so he can awkwardly hump her without an erection but why do I check? until she somehow dies. To me that's a good enough gimmick for 80 minutes of Zgrade schlock but writerdirector Luigi Batzella is a lazy lazy man. In 1970 he made a war movie called When The Bell Tolls that nobody saw so he figured...why not splice it into this one almost entirely? If you don't know that in advance this is a really confusing mess. The war scenes come out of nowhere but they end up making up more than half of this movie. It's so glaringly obvious that Batzella is just using these scenes as padding while you just want to find out what's going on in the torture chamber spoilers torture. So you get fifteen minutes of terrible yet delightfully cheesy fun and an hour of intensely boring subplots that barely pretend to be from the same movie.The main saving grace of this movie is the aforementioned Macha Magall an unknown actress that made her last movie in 1982. For shame because she finds the perfect balance between attractive and freightening. She's certainly an interesting screen presence but because of Batzella's pennypinching our lead actress is actually barely in this movie. She deserved to be in much better projects than this but somehow never really made it into the mainstream. Then again I guess the lack of a real legacy or any other background information does give her some kind of mystique.".

I haven't seen too many of these Nazi SS camp flicks and this is supposedly one of the better ones...not.  To sum up the plot  It's war the Nazis are taking over by shooting everyone and everything in town including a scene that involves a really unconvincing baby while scientists are conducting experiments on this Beast thingie of the original Italian title.  He is nothing more than a hairy ugly brute of a man who stays locked up in a cage during much of the film.  From time to time he is given the pleasure of torturing some poor hapless nude woman where he then proceeds to rip out their pubic hairs.  Sounds like fun eh? The movie is executed in such a way that even the most vile offensive things in this movie wouldn't even shock my own grandmother.  It's all done very shoddily and uninteresting.  Shame really.  These SS flicks have never really peaked my interest and this movie only decreased it.  It's hard to find but my video chain carries it  in the war section.".

	schema:reviewBody "SS HELL CAMP is another in a long line of relatively dull yet sometimes entertaining Nazisploit films. I know that seems like a contradictory statement but almost all of the films that I've seen of this genre fall into that category namely  most of the film is pretty dull with atrocious acting stupid story lines bad accents and lots of pointless dialog...which are then punctuated with some shocking scenes of torture andor sex. I kind of like these films for the sheer sleazefactor but I feel that the Nazisploit genre as a whole is relatively disappointing and the subject matter has never really been handled to it's full potential.Amidst the rather dull plot  the basic story is about a bunch of Nazi's trying to track down and kill a bunch of rebels. Throw in a side story about an experimental beast which is really just an ugly hairy guy that grunts a lot and makes a bunch of goofy faces...who rapes the Nazi's prisoners  and there ya have it...There are definitely a few sleazy scenes that are amusing  particularly the babytargetpractice and the female pubic hair removal by the beast who then proceeds to eat said bush. Of course the FX are horrible but a few of the scenes are adequate. There is some nudity but it's mainly by a bunch of nasty looking broads and a bunch of naked dudes with their wieners hanging out  so not much to rave about there unless that's your thing..... But even so SS HELL CAMP was mildly amusing and is probably worth a look to hardcore exploitation fans  but I highly recommend trying to find it to rent as it's not worth buying. 610".

	schema:reviewBody "Luckily by the time I put this film on I'd drank about six cans of Stella which meant that when the shaky video to DVD transfer came on screen my brain was perfectly tuned to the trembling wavery image that greeted me.The Beast in Heat is a sleazy video nasty of the Nazisploitation type which means lesbian action pubic hair rape torture and all sorts of crap poorly executed so much that it begins after a while and several cans of Stella to look like an episode of You've Been Framed.The story? I can't really remember but I'll describe the first scene. Some Nazi chick I first thought her name was Dr Crash then Dr Crap but on the back of the DVD box it says that her name is Krast throws a local Italian woman to some freaky piglike creature who begins to rape her. We get loads of close ups of his buttocks gyrating about two feet away from her body. And she has her legs closed. Dr Crap asks a German soldier if he's excited to which he replies yes and gets a slap for his trouble. Then Dr Crap asks this German chick if she's excited and the chick says she's excited for the progress of the experiment and she gets a kiss. Meanwhile the Italian chick dies because she's begun to realise how this film will turn out.This is classic exploitation stuff and I mean classic in the sense that it follows the usual pattern these films do  you get some sleaze and violence at the start then some boring bits then more sleaze then more boring bits then the end of the film. In this film some partisans are brought in to pad out the story along with a bumbling German officer. Not much of this is of any interest to anyone. In fact it seemed to me that my Stellaaddled brain was switching off each time these guys were featured in a scene.What I gathered was that one of the hookers who has really badlystaged sex with the German officer is a spy and lets on to the partisans that there's some bad doings going down over in Nazi town which involves all those Italian partisan chicks that keep disappearing. Things like being eaten by rats tortured by Dr Cramps did she have to do that topless? and best worst? of all having their fake pubes ripped off by the beast and eaten. Later I was lucky enough to wake up in time to see Dr Craptastic getting thrown to beast and get her comeuppance before one of the crew got fed up making the film and machine gunned everyone on set or something.Crap acting crap direction crap transfer. Another video nasty that doesn't live up to it's name and basically all it boils down to is another Italian hack aiming purely to make cash through some crap genre or other. I had a hangover the next day...or was it this film? I recommend that this film be played at every Church in Britain instead of mass. Every Sunday.".

Although censorship in the UK has been greatly relaxed since the video nasty scare we are still a conservative nation and a few of those films still remain banned and unavailable since it is illegal to sell films in the UK unless it has a rating from the BBFC.The Beast in Heat hasn't actually been submitted to the BBFC since being prosecuted all those years ago and there really isn't any point in trying because if I know one thing it's this  this film will NEVER legally see the light of day in this country.The plot is really nonsense. The Nazis are in town and in some dodgy basement a scary female scientist the superb Macha Magall is trying to produce some sort of randy beast for reasons that aren't really that clear. Here she throws poor naked local lasses in with him where he rapes them to death. If this isn't enough she also tortures them in other ways as well. Meanwhile the local partisans are blowing up bridges and trying to infiltrate the Nazis for information while arguing amongst themselves.The obvious aim of a film like this is to shock and dare to go where no film has gone before. It puts the film on banned lists and it rises to immortality when really it should have been forgotten years ago.Yes the production values are bad the acting is bad the dubbing is laughable. The partisan parts are there to flesh out the run time and no attempt has been made to make those sections coherent. Characters appear and disappear you haven't a clue really who anyone is and what they are meant to be doing half the time. Although the priest is brilliant especially when he gets angry! Of course the film is really about what goes on in the Nazi basement. Conceptually these scenes are horrendous. Water torture finger nails pulled off eaten alive by rats. In practice though they are so badly done you are almost embarrassed for the filmmakers.There were a few interesting things I found though. The rape scenes are filmed in such a surreal way that it takes the edge of the disgust you should be feeling. Lots of weird camera angles and bizarre close ups of the manbeast are more trippy then anything else and completely at odds with the way the rest of the film is shot. Conversely the scene where the evil Doctor gets her horribly ironic comeuppance is shot in a more conventional way much less swirly camera and loads more focus on her suffering really made for uncomfortable viewing.Also the ending is rather sad and strange and would almost be poignant if there where any earlier attempts at plotting or character development even just a little.What I find interesting about exploitation films even one as bad as this is that you can always find teeny tiny glimpses of attempts made by directors to actually be interesting rather then just shoot and cash the paycheck.All in all this film is likely to offend a lot of people likely to bore the others but I have a high trash tolerance and I found myself drawn in to the film for all its faults and enjoyed it for what it is  high camp tasteless disgusting filth!".

	schema:reviewBody "My god this film is terrible!! One of the hardest films to track down in the UK video nasties scare there are instances even now of this selling for 200300 on eBay in it's original VHS video format ...!! Unfortunately this film being rare had nothing whatsoever to do with it being any good.The Beast in Heat to use its more famous title seems to be a low budget clone of Ilsa She Wolf of the SS but without a single ounce of the talent or budget present in any aspect of even that film's production. It's basically a very boring war movie in which we watch grumpy and very obviously unGerman looking Nazi soldiers trade insults with civilians and members of resistance groups in some anonymous European village. Every so often some very obvious stock footage kicks in of planes and tanks attacking which apart from being obviously filmed completely separately is also in a different aspect ratio to the main feature footage!! Yes it's that bad! This dull state of affairs drags on for 85 of the films running time and is enough to have you reaching for the fast forward after just a few minutes. Everything is awful  the acting the script the dubbing the sets...one hilarious moment occurs early on when a railway bridge is blown up. I guarantee you've never seen anything so lame. I swear they had the camera zoom in wildly on a STILL PICTURE of a very small detonation and even added extra hand drawn flame effects directly onto the celluloid. If it wasn't for the unbearable tedium of the rest of the film you could at least spend a few happy minutes laughing at this type of stuff.But of course somewhere in this mess lurks the reason for the film's true appeal  the scenes of SS officers torturing naked women prisoners. I'll give this film one just ONE! compliment  it does star a very foxy leading lady in the shape of Macha Magall as the sadistic Doctor Kratsch. Sadly no match for Dyanne Ilsa Thorne in the charisma stakes but it's impossible to tell if she's any good as an actress due to the inept dubbing she is saddled with along with the rest of the cast.That aside the cruel experiments that she is in charge of are real bottomofthebarrel trash. Making most shock value in the cheapest way possible is easy  have everyone naked. Right what next? Well from there the flaws really start to pile up. The central experiment of the film is a sexcrazed dwarf that Dr Kratsch keeps in a cage and whom she occasionally whips up into a frenzy of overacting by throwing a naked woman in with him. What follows each instance of this is a montage of the worst possible facepulling and general pantomime style rape attacking from the dwarf and plenty of screaming from the hapless naked actress while she tries to look as though she is being overpowered by the crazed mini monster rather difficult as he is so small! The camera zooms in wildly on splashes of toored tomato sauce being liberally splashed about as the beast carries out his assault. In one sequence the dwarf even ups the outrage stakes by lifting his crosseyed face from woman's lap to show a mouthful of tornout bloodied hair...ugh! Don't worry there's not even a hint of realism to any of this. All the while Dr Kratsch and her attending guards watch silently occasionally licking their lips in apparent arousal at the gruesome sight I don't know where all the unusable footage of them laughing their heads off is but there must be loads of it.Realism fares no better in other scenes as still more naked prisoners are tortured eaten alive by rats yes they are gerbils or have stuckon fingernails pulled out The dubbing in these scenes is the worst synched dialogue you have ever seen. Stop it...you're hurting me... the soundtrack burbles while a bored looking actress's lips move in completely unconnected directions. Even throwing a baby in the air for rifle target practise or shooting a naked woman directly between the legs can't raise a gasp with production values as low as these.Due to the sparse placement of the torture scenes within the rest of the generally boring war and resistance action it's rare for anyone to manage the feat of sitting through this rubbish to the bitter end so should you fail I'm sure you can guess the well deserved fate that awaits our cruel SS lady doctor...have a guess where she ends up. Sadly it's presented very half heartedly...you'll be only too happy to see the end of the film roll up on your TV. To realise that such a waste of space as this has been given a DVD release is more entertaining than actually watching the thing. They could at least have kept the original cover  a hint of which can be seen in the lower left corner of the sleeve it was a masterpiece of trash cinema promotion.The irony is that the British politicians and press who campaigned for films like these to be banned have ultimately succeeded in prolonging their shelf life far beyond that which the films deserve. This should go back to the obscurity in which it belongs.".

This isn't uncommon in Godard's work but it's especially true of his later work. I've seen besides New Wave First Name Carmen Hail Mary and his segment from the omnibus opera film Aria. That segment is actually one of his best works as well. Sticking with the two other features they are both interesting and beautiful but very slow films. New Wave seems a lot like them at first especially in its confusing narrative I had to read a synopsis on it to find out exactly what the plot was. It shares their beauty but its even more pronounced. If I were advising someone on this film I would tell them to disregard the narrative completely. Just watch it for its pictorial beauty. And its sound. Godard's experiments in sound have always been one of the most prominent traits of his cinema. It goes back at least to Une femme est une femme way back in '62. This film contains the most interesting experiments in sound. The music is absolutely beautiful and like many of his other films it stops abruptly pops back up when you're not expecting it and shifts volumes randomly. The sound effects are also quite beautiful. While New Wave was perhaps dull in its narrative it's an examination of capitalism and consumerism who cares? This is film. Film is a visual medium and this is a visual masterpiece. Remember RES NON VERBA things not words an intertitle that appears frequently in the film. Oh and Alain Delon star of such great films as Rocco and His Brothers stars. He's still a major stud! 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's not possible for me at this point to go through every Godard film but it's also of no interest. Naturally I may be missing shades or nuance of his film personality but what's of interest to me is to be able to see in these snapshots removed by time how he has evolved or stayed the same how the old conundrums are expressed in new ways and is there a chronicle here of time gone.The title here may be in reference to a number of things what I get from it though is the transfiguration of New Wave expression. None of the subsequent Godard films I've seen has been any less New Wave than his New Wave films but what is New Wave now as opposed to thirty years ago? It stands out immediately to me that his Michel Poiccards have aged that Godard has aged with them mellowed perhaps by a certain failure to become instruments in the shaping of a better world by a recognition that they're still standing on the same inscrutable dilemmas about love and death and that a wind of change didn't sweep them up or passed them by. Godard approaches politics here as he did before. This time the bitter realization of an unjust world is spoken not by romantic fools in the middle of an irreverent crime spree but corporate people in suits and ties as they strike business deals. This is done without the gloating of triumph like perhaps the Michel Poiccards and Pierrots grew up to inevitably conform and ruminate.Alain Delon walks through this with sometimes a look of curious dispassion sometimes weary astonishment with a contradiction. As with Prenom Carmen I see in Godard a willingness to meditate on the nature of things to let go and be at peace. His characters quip philosophically in constant verbiage but the film pauses to observe to record branches of trees or clouds passing over a dark sun. The contradiction as it were is rooted for me in a certain kind of acceptance or the dawning of it. This world may not be better what these people dreamed in their youth but it's not so bad either.One line particularly stands out for me in this acceptance. There is no higher judge what isn't resolved by love stays in suspense. This is one of the most beautiful things I've heard in film and more knowing a little of Godard the contrast amazes me.Alphaville ends with a similar declaration of the importance of love but it comes in a point in time for Godard that I feel unconvinced by it do I take it seriously or is it also part of the joke. Here it's done without irony.This is important for me not only because it points a way out of the mind but because it celebrates a meaningful universe even at the absence of a higher decree. If Godard's life and work is narrative and this is what I'm pursuing in my quest Nouvelle Vague would make for a soaring finale. But it's not a finale so things are bound to get even more interesting.".

	schema:headline " Godard is an acquired taste";
	schema:reviewBody "...and one I won't be cultivating.Nouvelle Vague from 1990 is a JeanLuc Godard film starring Alain Delon in a dual role and Domiziana Giordano. Giordano plays a very successful Italian businesswoman Elena who sees a man Lennox Delon injured on the side of the road and falls in love with him. He dotes on her and does everything for her. He walks around with a sad face saying little while she is high powered with servants and business people around.Later something happens that throws her into an upheaval and calls on her to question her life.This is a film done in the New Wave style which I loathe. I have not been able to get through five minutes of Breathless 2001 A Space Odyssey Day for Night  I can't do it. To me it's like two people sitting down and reading the local section of the news to one another in a conversational tone  for two hours. This I will grant you is more dramatic in tone. The dialogue is entirely made up of quotations from many sources including Dante Proust Rimbaud and Raymond Chandler. Someone compared the dialogue to a Calvin Klein commercial.'Maybe a man isn't enough for a woman or perhaps he's too much'...Is this grass? Or is grass within me? If it is not called grass is it still grass? It comes off as terribly pretentious along with the Latin title cards that introduce each section.Godard intended this film as an allegory on film history. Elena represents the film industry. Lennox initially represents film and its makers that nurtured by the industry but ultimately die off if not permanently then nearly. Richard also Delon is film reborn in New Wave where filmmakers possess knowledge of film history but can manipulate it to their own ends.Domiziana Giordano is very beautiful and does a good job with what she has. Delon is described by one reviewer as a fading matine idol. Sorry but it's hard to kill a face like that. At 55 he is still a gorgeous hunk and actually remained so well beyond that. He does a terrific job here I think in his dual role one submissive and one dominant. I frankly think this is over the heads of most filmgoers particularly in the United States. If you are a fan of Godard or New Wave you will want to see this and undoubtedly get more out of it than we mere mortals.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vague is the important word here. It's a shame that Godard spoils the memory of a truly remarkable genre of films in using the title New Wave for this disappointing effort from 1990. Vague is screen legend Alain Delon's expression throughout the film vague is the message which Godard fails to communicate vague is the attempt which the auteur makes to be innovative and relevant so many years after his genius first sparked revolution in the seventh art. Down to the nittygritty Godard attempts a film whose dialogue is based on a mixture of abrasive noisy hyperrealism and sombre philosophic truisms. In this sense he achieves some grade of success. The film skips on at it's own idiosyncratic pace jerking one way and then another through the landscape of lateTwentiethCentury European capitalism and empty absurd avarice. Some of these jagged philosophical bursts of conversation are successfully framed by the mechanical and natural surrounds in a manner unique to Godard. He disdains obvious narrative constructs in favour of a more jarring technique throwing together literary and cinematic quotations to raise questions which seem never to be answered. However many of the ideas presented appear overly contrived and incoherent almost as if he has given up attempting to resolve any of the larger philosophical issues and instead satisfies himself with an indulgent dignified surrender to the inevitable.Domiziana Giordano's performance as the ponderous Italian heiress Elena TorlatoFavrini is more irritating than poetically captivating as might have been the director's intention. Her limited emotional range her unnecessary mix of languages and Alain Delon's almost bemused reaction leaves a tone of falsity and pretension hanging in the air and ringing in the viewer's ear. Delon himself seems lost and miscast in his double role of hapless taciturn accident victim Roger Lennox and his selfassured gregarious twin Richard. The film's confused and ultimately superfluous plot restricts his potential to inject any significant improvisation charisma or depth into either of these crude alter egos. If anything he is more successful depicting the ambitious devilmaycare doppelganger than portraying the silent submissive apprentice reluctantly introduced into the shallow world of Godard's European upper classes. Visually of course Nouvelle Vague has many of the marks of the great French filmmaker. He paints with the excellent collaboration of cinematographer William Lubtchansky visions derived from a world comprised of memory and halfunderstood dreams. Nostalgia is always on the threshold as Godard revisits the luxuriant natural environment of his youth now lit with late evening shadows and golden autumn tones. Also to be welcomed are the touches of humour which offer some relief from the cumbersome and often clichd musings of the various characters. Chief amongst the running jokes is the existential angst represented by a recurring question pronounced by Raoul Dorfman's Christophe Odent beautiful young trophy girlfriend Maria Pitarresi What will I do ? His pragmatic response Admire the nature admire the architecture admire the furniture !. Less welcome is the discordant soundtrack which makes viewing the film a decidedly uncomfortable experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not one of my favorite Godard films  this 1990 entry Novelle vague New Wave so to speak. While there were things about the film that left me unfulfilled after repeat viewings I probably can't recommend the film to someone who might by the luck of the invisible filmgeek Gods find the tape in the videostore and only will watch it once. By the time I had my third viewing of this the first two times I just couldn't get through to the end maybe too tired maybe just not in the mood for so much Godard going on I respected it a little more than on my first viewing though that's giving it some more credit than it should. Bottom line folks this is a hardcore unabashed artfilm where symbolism is turned up to eleven on the intellectual amp images are put forth that do hold interest and when I say that I mean sporadically in the poetic love nature over the manmade structure sense and of course Alain Delon and Domiziana Giordano as the lead couple. Although Giordano is given some emotions to work with and her start to the film in which she accidentally runs over a hitchhiker on the road should kick off something more interesting than it does Delon mostly walks around with the same face looking dour and unhappy until midway through the film which I won't spoil. To put it another way it makes his performance as the ultra lowkey killer in Le Samourai look like Robert De Niro in Goodfellas. To say that the film has no coherent plot is a giveaway. If you're looking for the kinds of stories that kept Godard's newwave films of the 60's which were interspersed here and there with the philosophy and poetry he overloads here may be disappointed. In fact the film almost achieves an ironic success in making the film far from the real purpose of the newwave to start with. Godard gives us characters in this film but some are left on the screen so briefly it's hard to comprehend what they're talking about. Some of the stuff on the corporations are interesting as well are a few pivotal scenes to what story there is but then it's gets downplayed by the mainly pretentious attitude. Maybe my biggest problem with the film is that Godard seems to be backing a viewer not just myself but any particular viewer who'd seek this film out into a corner a part of me feels guilty for thinking a lot of the film just wasn't good because there was some good to it. The editing by Godard himself had a rhythm to it I kinda dug the cinematography kept the colors vivid and the choices in music were the typical freefancy Godard we know from the 60's. But in all and perhaps I can't put my finger on it Novelle vague is just not my cup of tea. Maybe someday some hip cool movie professor will give me another perspective on what I'm missing.".

	schema:headline " Beyond tearjerker into deep tragedy and all for nothing";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't care if no one ever finds this comment helpful but it has to be said. This movie goes beyond 1930's ladies' matine threehankie weepy into the depths of unnecessary tragedy and most people will not even realize it. SPOILERS  The main character is Eve Appleton played wonderfully by the beautiful and sensitive Kay Francis. Eve is a smalltown woman with high aspirations as an actress and the talent to make her dreams come true. But through nothing more than bad luck her ambitions lead to an unpremeditated killing by her decent but clueless husband which leads to his conviction and lifesentence for murder. She vows to get him released and to devote the rest of her life to being a good little wife. She struggles for years to reach the highest levels as an actress winning fame on both sides of the Atlantic which finally gives her the money to pay for the lawyers and political contacts that will get her husband out of prison. The movie ends with her and her little girl walking the long dusty road to the prison to be reunited with her husband undoubtedly to follow through with her promise to love honor and obey forever and ever amen THE END.Baloney or worse!! In the eight years over which the story unfolds we see Eve's incredible strength of character and determination to achieve her goals as she struggles up the performing ranks from carnival shows to prestripper burlesque to vaudeville to Broadway and London. We see her pain as she must turn the raising of her infant daughter over to a faded starlet who really loves the child and raises her well but who keeps secret from the daughter who her real mommy and daddy are. We can be hopeful for a happy ending as we realize that not only has Eve now known as Wilson attained the heights of her career but now has the love of a Broadway producer who understands her better than her smalltown husbandwhom she no longer lovescould ever dream to.I hoped so much that after she freed her husband he would learn that she hadn't been a Manhattan nanny all those years that he would realize that they were no longer right for each other that he would absolve her of her promise and they could finally go on their respective ways to their separate happinesses.But no. And here comes the part where I don't care what anyone else thinks of my comments.Whether anyone knows it or not our lives are ruled by philosophy dealing with answers to questions such as... Do I recognize and adhere to the facts of reality or do I ignore them and pretend they don't matter? Or... Do I act to achieve my goals and happiness or do I give them up to serve others as if their goals matter but mine don't?Recognizing reality would have required Eve to admit that she would be living in a fantasy world to think she could keep the truth of her past life a secret from her husband forever. She had become an internationally known beauty and would have to live in constant fear that somebody might someday recognize her and tell her husband. She must spend the rest of her life pretending to love a man and hope he never notices the lie. She must perpetually shush her daughter into silence the daughter who by then not only knows her true mother's identity but also her mother's phenomenal success. And Eve is REALLY fantasizing if she thinks she can suppress everything in her without becoming embittered and resentful and turning into the exact opposite of the loving wife she wishes to be for her husband. All this is contrary to every fact the movie has shown us about her. So Eve will have to live as if facts are subservient to her wishes and fears as if reality means nothing.Worse yet philosophically is the moral lesson the movie implicitly preaches. Surrender your hopes and dreams. You made a promise and must keep it no matter how much you or your husband or the whole world have changed. But most of all you have no right to your happiness since duty service sacrifice selfdenial submission surrender are the essence of the moral principle called altruism which unfortunately rules the world. America with its unique notion of the individual's life liberty and the pursuit of happiness came closest to rejecting this prehistoric morality but altruism lives on in the world at large and in America so I should not be surprised that it also ruled at Warner Brothers in the 1930's. But I had hoped all the way up to the end for a happy and MORAL ending such as Eve and the American audience deserve.This doesn't mean don't see the movie. Kay Francis and several admirable supporting characters raise this film above mediocre. But be aware that the makers of this movie expect you to believe that Eve has done the right thing by sacrificing her ambitions. If you find yourself bothered by this ending I hope I may have given you a clue why you are right to feel disturbed.".

The twopronged premise that this movie is based on is ridiculous and unbelievable in the extreme. Kay is a smalltown wife and mother who yearns for something bigger she wants to be an actress. When a bigshot actor comes to town and invites Kay to his hotel to talk about possibilities Kay tells her husband she's going to the movies. The hubby's biddy of a mother puts a bug in hubby's ear that Kay's not being truthful and he sets out looking for her. He finds her w the actor in the hotel they are only talking! and he slugs the guy who falls over a railing lands facefirst in a pond lake? and dies. Now here's the two unbelievable premises upon which the rest of the movie is based 1 the judge tells the jury that if it's determined that the man died before his head went into the water that they must find the hubby guilty of first degree murder. Whaaaaa?????? I think slugging a guy in a fit of rage would count for manslaughter or murder 2 at the most not FIRST DEGREE murder. Give me a break! But the plot required him being found guilty of murder 1 so that he could be sent to prison for life. Whatever. 2 the hubby's lawyer after the conviction and sentencing tells Kay that it's all HER fault. His reasoning is that if she hadn't gone over to the actor's room then her husband wouldn't have had to go after her and slug the guy and kill him. He tells her that she's the guilty one not her husband and she nods and agrees. What. The. Hell?!?!?! The rest of the movie is all about Kay trying to achieve fame and money in order to get her husband released from prison and right the wrong she committed by causing him to kill the actor dude in the first place.I can't even go on with this review. The movie was just all too painful. Four years earlier in the precode days you'd never have caught Kay playing such a wimp! In true Kay Francis fashion though she did do her best to make us believe that this woman was a believable character. I give her much credit for trying to breathe some life and credibility to this thankless role. This character was a far cry from precode Kay roles and reallife spitfire Kay Francis.Steer way clear of this one! There are much better Kay Francis vehicles out there! From personal experience I can highly recommend Mary Stevens MD and Jewel Robbery also good are Dr. Monica and One Way Passage. I'm sure there's other great Kay flicks as well but I'm only mentioning the ones I've seen and can recommend.".

	schema:headline " More Warner Bros substandard garbage for Kay Francis";
	schema:reviewBody "Kay Francis is a Comet Over Broadway in this 1938 sudser also starring Ian Hunter Minna Gombell John Litel Donald Crisp Sybil Jason. These melodramas Warners threw at Kay to try to force her and her 200000 salary out of there always seem like they were made 7 or 8 years earlier. In this one Kay is Eve Appleton an aspiring actress in a small town looked on disapprovingly by her motherinlaw but loved by her bumpkin husband Bill Litel. When a Barrymorelike read washed up drunk actor from New York hits town he takes an interest in Kay's talent. When he's through auditioning her he's dead Bill has life imprisonment for murder and she and her baby are on their way to New York so she can make money to free him.Yeah it gets better. Eve does the burlesque and vaudeville route along the way meeting Tim Gombell who offers to take daughter Jackie until Eve gets established. Once in New York she meets and falls in love with a producer Bert Balin Keith and he with her. He casts her in a play but his girlfriend the star orders her fired. So Eve goes to London in order to get away from the temptation of Bert. There she becomes a huge star and reunites with Jackie who calls Tim 'Mommy.' She also reconnects with Bert who offers her a play in New York. Since Bill's attorney needs money to free Bill apparently by bribing public officials it's not clear Eve takes an advance on her salary. WIth Bill soon to be free what does she do about her career and Balin? This absolutely preposterous dreck was directed by Busy Berkeley until he was hospitalized and then John Farrow took over. All it needed was a big dance number. Eve doesn't want her husband ever to learn about this enormous career  how is that supposed to be accomplished? Didn't the town know? This film was made in 1938 not 2008 and stage stars like Katherine Cornell and Eve LaGalliene were well known to people even in small towns because they toured with their plays. And how did this guy end up in jail for murder 1 to begin with? There was a fight and the actor landed in a pond with a fatal head injury. No manslaughter? But the judge gave him a break and didn't impose the death penalty. He thought this guy was coming onto his wife! I won't even go into Tim never bothering to mention that Eve was her mother.The acting by Kay Francis and one of my favorites Ian Keith is excellent and they do the best they can to raise up the level of this film. Unfortunately they're fighting a losing battle. Minna Gombell is pretty good if stagy as Tim and John Litel is appropriately simpleton.As for how this film truly ends I wouldn't DREAM of giving it away but if you listen carefully there's a line that promises us that the end we see is not the true end.

	onyx:emotionText "Kay Francis is a Comet Over Broadway in this 1938 sudser also starring Ian Hunter Minna Gombell John Litel Donald Crisp Sybil Jason. These melodramas Warners threw at Kay to try to force her and her 200000 salary out of there always seem like they were made 7 or 8 years earlier. In this one Kay is Eve Appleton an aspiring actress in a small town looked on disapprovingly by her motherinlaw but loved by her bumpkin husband Bill Litel. When a Barrymorelike read washed up drunk actor from New York hits town he takes an interest in Kay's talent. When he's through auditioning her he's dead Bill has life imprisonment for murder and she and her baby are on their way to New York so she can make money to free him.Yeah it gets better. Eve does the burlesque and vaudeville route along the way meeting Tim Gombell who offers to take daughter Jackie until Eve gets established. Once in New York she meets and falls in love with a producer Bert Balin Keith and he with her. He casts her in a play but his girlfriend the star orders her fired. So Eve goes to London in order to get away from the temptation of Bert. There she becomes a huge star and reunites with Jackie who calls Tim 'Mommy.' She also reconnects with Bert who offers her a play in New York. Since Bill's attorney needs money to free Bill apparently by bribing public officials it's not clear Eve takes an advance on her salary. WIth Bill soon to be free what does she do about her career and Balin? This absolutely preposterous dreck was directed by Busy Berkeley until he was hospitalized and then John Farrow took over. All it needed was a big dance number. Eve doesn't want her husband ever to learn about this enormous career  how is that supposed to be accomplished? Didn't the town know? This film was made in 1938 not 2008 and stage stars like Katherine Cornell and Eve LaGalliene were well known to people even in small towns because they toured with their plays. And how did this guy end up in jail for murder 1 to begin with? There was a fight and the actor landed in a pond with a fatal head injury. No manslaughter? But the judge gave him a break and didn't impose the death penalty. He thought this guy was coming onto his wife! I won't even go into Tim never bothering to mention that Eve was her mother.The acting by Kay Francis and one of my favorites Ian Keith is excellent and they do the best they can to raise up the level of this film. Unfortunately they're fighting a losing battle. Minna Gombell is pretty good if stagy as Tim and John Litel is appropriately simpleton.As for how this film truly ends I wouldn't DREAM of giving it away but if you listen carefully there's a line that promises us that the end we see is not the true end. Not that it matters.Oh of mild interest for one line spoken by future star Susan Hayward during the amateur theatrics scene.";

	schema:reviewBody "Many reviewers treat this film as a major studio production an All About Eve of its time and scathingly criticize it's inadequacies of which there are admittedly many. But there are multiple pleasures to be had in a very short running time though many of them are guilty ones.This soapy yarn centers around a hometown newsstand girl who becomes an international actress almost overnight in order to make sure her dull hubby John Litel doesn't stay into the clink where he was tossed when he offed a bad actor by decking him for insulting Our Kay. The film was made during a later period of Kay's career when Warners was attempting to convince their fading star to break her contract so they wouldn't need to pay her exorbitant contract fee Gutsy Kay didn't care much at this point but gamely let herself be cast in B movies like this one second string films weepers made specifically for women's matineesa time long before television. She still made the money. The OrryKelly costumes that Kay styles are ravishing as she rises from burlesque sweetie to continental darling the dresses rise to the occasion often deliciously outrageous. And there are some worthwhile performances from familiar Hollywood character actors the best likely from Minna Gombel as a wise old broad who knows her way around and babysits Kay's souvenir from her small town marriageand you may want to strangle Sybil Jason a child star who mugs and grimaces until you want to scream for her to get off the screen! During an early backstage visit as Kay meets the famous outoftown thespian one also gets a glimpse of Susan Hayward who has a single line in an ittybitty part.And since we never ever get to see what talents catapulted Kay to world fame on stageshe's always ready to go on or meeting with someone after the show we don't get to see The Comet In Action! But this is melodrama at its most extreme and by the end of the film you may never forgive yourself for sticking with itunless you find the absurd conclusion as much fun as I did. Comet Over Broadway is not a great film and maybe not even a very good onebut it's never dull and is cunningly crafted so that you can hardly wait to see not only what Kay will wear next but if her heart will take her where it should.".

	schema:reviewBody "One would admit that the production values of this film are skimpy but that's not really the essential message of this film. It's not about a woman giving up her womanhood to stand on her own. Nor about true love. It is a simple tale of one's own self worth and the ethics of life.Kay's character in the beginning is a self centered nitwit with dreams of stardom. She forgoes any sense of propriety. She lies to her husband and visits a smarmy has been actor in his cabin. Alone. At night. Moments before he will sexually assault herand even Kay can see this coming her husband intrudes and in the scuffle and fight kills him. It's accidental but the court doesn't see it that way and the poor chap is carted off to prison for the rest of his life. Kay fools herself into thinking that once she becomes a star she can free her husband come back and love him.Off to New York she goes. With her toddling child. Why didn't she leave her with her mother inlaw? Yes she hates Kay. Understandably. Her flightiness caused the tragedy. After all she would have cared for her grandchild. And the truth would have been told and the young girl could have visited her father. Yes yes in prison. Kay would have come out the stinker but then she should have.So Kay goes to New York and puts the make on a theatrical producer. Because he already has a girlie she gets Kay fired. But the Broadway hotshot promises her a big break in another production. For once in her life she uses her brain and says no dice. Exit Kay.Now she's off to London to become a star on her own. However her kid is a bit of a drag on her. She is way too easily convinced to leave the child with an over the hill hoofer she meets while touring the States. What conscientious mother would drop her child and be an ocean away from her? Kay would. And she does.In London Kay at last realises her dreams. She sends for the kid. The hoofer brings her but the child regards the hoofer as her mother. Kay is pissed. But the hoofer explains the facts of the situation to Kay. As if she should need to have them explained to her. With a tear in her eye Kay sees the right of it.It's probably here when the script Kay has been following in her quest for fame and redemption gets complicated. Her poor child goes through emotional torture on being separated from her surrogate mother to live with Kay. It's pathetic but the poor kid endures. Her surrogatehoofer mother is devastated as well on losing the child she halfraised and will soon become a fixture in every sleazy bar in New York.Kay's producer boyfriend has since returned though to pick up where they left off. They're so very very happy. The child is doing better. Kay is famous. She's in love bless her. Now she'll really feel great about herself when she can see her husband walk out of the prison he's been in for the past eight years. Thanks to her then and her money now. After that she can tell him she's never loved him and let's just leave bygones be bygones because she wants to marry another man.But when she sees her husband life doesn't play out the way she thought. He still loves her. Unquestionably. Unconditionally. He hasn't seen his own child in years. He's rather frail. A heart condition. But he has dreams. Of an automotive shop. Of them being together as a family again. Hearing this her lifelong brain fog clears. She is his wife. His dreams are just as worthy and just as valid as her were. She realised her dream. Isn't her Broadway romance looking just a little cheap around the edges now? Kay has left nothing but a trail of tears behind her. The poor lecher that was accidentally killed her broken hearted mother in law seeing her son go off to prison her child's loss of her surrogate mother the surrogate mother's loss of her child....EGads!Maybe it's your turn Kay to take the bad with the good.... Certainly her daughter is willing.By the way Kay Francis is superb. Bette Davis would have ruined it.".

From there on in the story doesn't get any more logical.I've never been a fan of Kay Francis and find it hard to see the qualities that made her for several years the biggest female star in Hollywood. I guess there were a lot of people who liked to watch a woman suffer which was her trademark. In this movie she does her fair share of suffering though she does realize her theatrical ambitions to become the toast of the London stage.As others have remarked the ending is pretty nutty but I guess this is what her fans expected. She forsakes any chance at personal happiness in order to be true to the promise to her husband she made 8 years earlier and because of her guilt over having caused his imprisonment. But how could you believe that she would give up the stage career that meant so much to her? Or that no one in their small town would know she'd become a star? Yes there was no internet but everyone read newspapers and magazines.Sybil Jason who plays the daughter is like Kay now widely forgotten but in her day was second only to Shirley Temple in child star popularity. She has a weird distracting accent she was born in South Africa and some annoying affectations. In this story she's put through an emotional ringer similar to Kay's having to find out that the woman who raised her isn't her mother than being taken away from her. And then she has to be sworn to secrecy that Kay is a big star. Can any child really keep that secret? And we never learn what happened to Tim who raised her. She just conveniently drops out of the story. Tim was played by Minna Gombell usually a character actress but here with a pretty big part.Why couldn't she just tell Bill that she was now a successful actress? Wouldn't he want the financial security she could provide the family? What was he going to do to support the family after 8 years in prison? Well I guess that's par for the course for Kay. Living a life of small town poverty with a man she doesn't love. More suffering.".

Taking advantage of her admiration and aspirations Keith makes a pass at Francis and then Mr. Litel interrupts them. He accidentally kills Keith with a single punch. The court is unfair and Litel is sentenced to life in prison. This leaves Francis free to pursue her acting career...Francis also vows to get her husband out of jail and be a good homemaker someday. She gives their baby to lonely older showgirl Minna Gombell as Tim Adams to raise as her own daughter. The little girl grows up to be pintsized Garbo Sybil Jason as Jackie. Francis works as a carnival burlesque and vaudeville entertainer. She finds stardom and romance with playwright producer Ian Hunter as Bert Ballin. Eventually Francis' past catches up with her... Susan Hayward has a small part in the first minutes as Francis' amateur play ends. Later former star Maurice Costello appears on stage as a nonspeaking actor.

The very best thing about it is that it's short. Oh and the OrryKelly gowns of course are fine. James Wong Howe's cinematography is not. Kay Francis throughout looks fatfaced and far less attractive than she normally does. Minna Gombell whom I don't know otherwise is good as a semitough burlesque dancer it looked more like a fashion show than burlesque. The closing shot  Kay Francis and her child when did the child learn that Kay Francis was her mother? Did I doze off? walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is beyond ludicrous. The whole film is so cheap so implausible and so careless that it feels infected by a sour cynicism on the part of everyone who made it Warner Bros tossing garbage to dolts who don't know in Warner Bros' cynical estimation of them that what they're getting is garbage.".

Comet Over Broadway is another advertisement to stay very far away from the theater unless it's your goal to have a difficult upsetting life and wreck the lives of those around you. Kay Francis wants to be a star more than anything in the world and as everyone knows you have to be willing to do anything to make it. Every clich in the book is in this movie about what a young hopeful has to sacrifice to become a starlet. You've heard of it Kay Francis does it. This is a pretty melodramatic movie typical of the early 1930s so if you don't usually like drama drizzled on top of drama for no reason you probably won't like this one. I didn't really like it because everything could have been avoided if Kay Francis decided to settle down for a normal life. A good therapist could have helped her and saved me an hour.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wow the plot for this film is all over the place! There is so much plot and so many things that happen that it practically made my head spin!! And as a result none of it seemed particularly believable.The movie starts with Kay Francis as a housewife living in a small town. She's had some experience with local theater and has ambitions of going to Broadway. When a bigtime actor arrives in town she pursues him in hopes that he can give her a career boost. But her husband is worried about shenanigansas this actor is a cad. So the hubby bursts in on them and hits the actorand the actor dies! As a result he's convicted of First Degree Murder!!! Not Manslaughter but Murder 1! Now pregnant and in need of funds Kay goes to New York. But Broadway jobs aren't to be found so she's forced to take any jobeven Burlesque. Unable to adequately care for her young daughter she gives it to another woman to raise. However eventually she does find a job in a real Broadway play and everything looks rosy. But the jealous diva starring in the play hates her for some inexplicable reason and forces her to be thrown off the play. Despondent she makes her way to England and becomes a real star. Years later she returns to New York to get her kidbut the child is older and thinks the woman caring for her is her real mother. At the same time her husband's lawyer now thinks that if he gets 10000 he can get the man out of prison. As another reviewer wrote is this to bribe people?! How can 10000 get him out otherwisemaybe it will buy a helicopter so they can fly into the prison yard and scoop him up!! Wowthis is enough for 2 or 3 films! And all this occurs by the 45 minute mark!!! Believe it or not there's quite a bit more to it. If you really care see it yourself to find out how it all unfolds.This is sort of like 'kitchen sink writing'throwing in practically everything and hoping somehow it will all work. Unfortunately the film turns out to be hopelessly unbelievable and mushy despite Ms. Francis' best efforts. It's the sort of film no one could really have saved thanks to a 2ndrate plot. It's almost as if someone just took a few dozen plot elements threw them into a box and then began randomly picking them in order to make a movie!! Overall unless you are a diehard Kay Francis fan or love anything Hollywood made in the 1930s this one is one you can easily skip. Not terrible but certainly not good.By the way the child who plays Francis' daughter upon her return to New York Sybil Jason really was terrible. I think she was supposed to be...I think.".

Ninety per cent of the film graphically depicts the girls in a series of wild and frivolous adventures. Staples of 70's cinema such as drugs politics the generation gap communal living and free sex are thrown into a mix to produce an enjoyable cinematic cocktail that captures the ennui of the period.The film's surprising last stanza sounds a meanspirited warning to women who freely advertise their sexuality without any intention of providing it. It is a nihilistic barbaric angry scene of human carnage that echoes the darkest aspects of Last House on the Left Straw Dogs and I Spit On Your Grave.A recurring song is used to potent effect over the end credits and the lead characters are brought to vivid life by the talented Guida and Carati.Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fernando Di Leo is a director that gets a lot of criticism and most of it is unfair in my opinion as he's directed a lot of the best Italian crime movies of the seventies as well as some other curious gems. To Be Twenty is something of a departure from his crime films and doesn't really fit into any of the main genre headings that were popular in seventies Italy although at a stretch it could be described as a cross between a sex comedy and an exploitation flick. The film is slightly misguided and that is its main problem as on the one hand it's light and breezy and on the other hand it actually tries to make some points...with mixed results. The plot focuses on two young girls who are both young hot and angry that meet on a beach. They set off to hitch a lift together and so begins an odyssey as the pair try to create an existence for themselves in a world overridden with sex perverts and drugs. They manage to find a place to stay but not everything goes to plan and before long the girls find themselves living a nightmare.The tone of the movie is one of the best things about it as the director excellently captures the hippystyle care free atmosphere through the two young girls. The film stars Gloria Guida and Lilli Carati both of whom serve the movie well in the looks department especially when their clothes come off but don't exactly set the film on fire with great acting. However luckily this is a film that doesn't need great acting to succeed. The plot flows well and the two girls provide likable characters that make the film fun to watch. It's not exactly plot heavy and the film basically follows the girls on their unplanned journey right up until we come to the tragic ending. The ending is actually rather strange as it doesn't fit the tone of the movie and actually looks more like something straight out of a roughie film. However it is rather powerful and won't be forgotten in a hurry and the reason for that is mostly down to the way we are made to like the characters throughout the film. Overall this film probably won't be for everyone's taste but if you like this sort of stuff you could do worse.".

	schema:headline " what a great movie it would have been IF...";
	schema:reviewBody "...if it had a better storyline. Avere vent'anni or 2b20 has a cult movie status. Until it was released in DVD few years ago with much claim and wawings by the cinema of genres lover. Originally released in 1978 2b20 was a complete failure and the producer forced the director Di Leo to change the final ending. But this resulted in nothing and the movie fell in forgotten unless for the lesbian scene between Gloria Guida and Lilli Carati the most beautiful and sexy actresses of the Italian cinema in the 70's both retired for good the first as the wife of ultra famous Italian ecletic showman Johnny Dorelli the second victim of terrible personal issues. I believe Di Leo wanted to show how the decadent society kills the young spirits like raping them. The sense of the final scene is that there is no space for the freewill and the spirit is killed by the dusty tradition. As usual Fernando Di Leo uses the women body to criticize the male stupidity insecurity. But the dark mood of the end of the movie have nothing to share with the comedy of the whole movie. In this movie the main characters of the two girls make no sympathy to the audience but their brutal death will make u sad. Anyways they are no heroes for the director. It seems that all the society and all the people are not worth a cent not even the two girls they die as they were only a minority. It is very difficult to find a focal point in the movie. There is simply not storyline the events have no importance in the whole movie. The director seems riding the line between an intellectual protest to the society that the counterculture was a total failure and a commercial sexy movie. Probably a major disappointment for the director himself this is a movie nice to see by the comedy side. Lot of nice jokes good direction scenes that makes sense on their own. Unfortunately there is no consequentiality hence the spectator has no sense of time. It looks like a telefilm made of episodes with the same characters but with different subjects. The final dark ending the rape is demonstrating that the same Di Leo didn't even know if this was an intellectual research on the failure of counterculture and all kind of human cultures or just a show of the beautiful bodies of the two actresses to the audience who were the top at the moment. Again the big regret is the total lack of a storyline. This is not new in Di Leo's movie especially in the poliziesco genre the storyline is usual simple and easy like the sentiment of human beings and in fact he's more interested in characters psychology. But in Avere Vent'Anni he is not able to give credibility to the events the time is not stressed in any way and the action is episodic. Despite this Di Leo doesn't loose a pinch of his screenplay writer genius. The characters speak common language not a Shakespearean litany he puts words that sound real. The directing is perfect also in this minor movie you can appreciate how good was the Italian director. The Actors it seems that the director shaped the personality of the two main characters on the two girls. Guida and Carati pierce the screen they have a beautiful photogenic face but they are not good actress at all and need to be dubbed. While the character of Carati is a though leading spirit the one of Guida is humble silent. I don't know if this is due to the real capability of the two actresses I've seen many movies and they provide the same expressions of this films. The character try to live their life at the limit to be real humans that take decision but the two actresses are not able to give a better impression than being an inflating doll and the idea of the free girls of the director is totally reversed by their poor acting! Some kind of importance has the character played by Ray Lovelock who is an ex teacher disappointed by the culture and the society who turned a junkie. Vittorio Caprioli is il Nazariota the Sai Baba wannabe the chief of the commune. He's old fat and a little dumb and looks always concerned of the economic part of the commune and never about the spiritual. He witnesses the end of counterculture and the decadence of those principles that made dream the young guys in early 70's. Caprioli is a fetish actor of Di Leo and he doesn't disappoint. Funny and great as ever. The real good surprise is made by the comedian Giorgio Bracardi especially famous in his surreal radio performances. Well Bracardi is over the top here and plays the part of the police officer who will send back home the two girls. It's incredible. He is serious but he can be funny grotesque is the right word. His facial expressions are exaggerated and this is the funny thing in it. He's so real in the stereotype of the police officer that he becomes funny.This is an average movie. Nice to see and easy to forget about it. Di Leo has done some pictures with no time real masterpieces fortunately rediscovered by the wise men at the beginning of this century. But Avere vent'anni is definitely not one of them. The movie was low budget and not well orchestrated like the other ones. The Di Leo style is present but I rate 2b20 as one of his minor films.".

Very much a Steven Seagal lookalike he provides most of the humour through his lies and cool front we almost think the film will take a dangerous turn. You really can't take this disjointed movie seriously even though it's spose to be. Gloria Guida is bloody sexy and Lil Carati pack some nice goodies. They really love sex and I love watching them have it. At the start both are hitching a ride where they soon wind up at the commune where we're witness to some quite weird going ons. Carati really has nice you know and seems to be the better actress out of the two. Though we're not watching this adult flick also known as To Be Twenty for acting ability. An old geezer pharmacist who needs the girls to show him he's a man again is the best performer. The girls scarcely get by on stealing stuff like sandwiches while also using their beauty. Guida is offered a big proposal by a lesbian talk show host or something after the commune is raided. If wanting to be serious this movie has surely misfired on that factor. The more vivacious Carati and friend don't mind making out in front of a kneeling Buddhist like figure face painted like a clown wearing a forlorn expression that suggests a bad fate awaits them. The beating track at the film's opening is mesmerizing. A bird watching pic is the purpose this film mostly serves thanks to our honeys Guida mainly.".

Tina who is the feisty and rebellious one and Lia who is more sensible and innocent. The two ladies want to have fun and enjoy life so are looking for liberation and after stealing some food from a local supermarket go on to find a commune for shelter. Whilst they are there all the men apart from the owner appear to be stoned and not capable of doing much especially when the owner says to the girls they can stay there rent free if they sleep with the men. The only other woman at the commune is finding it a struggle to look after three babies.Tina and Lia decide they don't want to have to sell themselves in order to stay at the commune and instead decide to sell encyclopedias for the owner in order to continue staying there. They encounter a few strange people with Lia having another young woman who is lesbian makes advances towards her.Things change at the commune when a film crew arrive and want to do a documentary on the people living there only Tina and Lia talk to them and then we get to find out more about their backgrounds which were not pleasant as they grew up. Then they get mixed up within police corruption and the commune is searched for drugs from an apparent tip off which results in the girls being deported.There are two versions of this film with the longest running for around 94 minutes in it's uncut form this is the version you should see which may have English subtitles.I wont give away the last fifteen minutes of the film although what started off as a comedydrama film with some nudity and a pop soundtrack which reflects on the different stages in the women's journeys transcends into a much more debatable topic of what i would class as a thriller of not only how women are represented but also how men can treat them and the consequences of peoples actions.Yes after watching the full version of this film people will compare it to several other exploitation films made around its time period although with this one it has three things that make an immediate impact. 1 The women come across as likable characters 2The justice system in general 3You can't always have authority or power and retain it.For me it had one of the most memorable endings i have ever seen which i would never forget and if the director set out to achieve the maximum impact then i think he did it successfully.I would rate this film 6 out of 10.".

His Caliber 9 is a great crime thriller example and this is a very decent sexploitation one. The lovely Gloria Guida is a bit led astray by the character played by Lilli Carati as the cheat steal and generally behave obnoxiously in the name of freedom. I don't know how realistic the commune presented here was in Italy but it doesn't seem like any other I've seen depicted. Even Valerie Solanas' S.C.U.M manifesto gets quoted here in the name of feminism and it is about at this stage when a film maker is introduced that we begin to realise what a gigantic swipe the writerdirector is taking at the counter culture and its opponents.

I too noticed the same things that turned off the others  the lack of typical plot dialog and drama. In fact halfway through the movie i was having a hard time staying focused. But then I started to get it. After the movie was over I watched the Making of... documentary that was on the DVD. It was only then that I truly understood. The director Straub a refugee from Algeria living in Germany. A 10 year quest to make the movie. Everything was dogmatically intentional. He wanted the performances to be shown statically. He believed if one was to listen to a 7 minute piece of music all the drama should be derived from the music not the cinematic arts. All sound was location the musicians are the highest caliber  everything played on screen. What movies today could boast of that? Also he said he wanted it to be as much a documentary about the virtuoso Leonhardt who plays Bach as it was about Bach. To him a long shot on the face of the performer was all one needed to experience the ecstasy of Bach. Remember too this is 1967 Germany. He was trying to avoid all nationalism and was glad to have a Dutchman play Bach. I think looking at this movie through the eyes of today's short attentionspanned explosion thirsty moviegoing POV is ignorant. I doubt many of those people could even sit through a 7 minute piece of music. Straub was 30 years ahead of his time. Anyone who appreciates the Dogma95 should understand. Finally I see that he and his wife had been making movies together for over 40 years until Danile died last fall. My condolences Mr. Straub. This is one person you have reached.".

Mostly he gets to walk purposefully or angrily out of various rooms. Bach's life of course was not an Errol Flynn movie. It was indeed fairly drab and more than a little hard.

It is in other words not so much a film as an illustrated album of some of Bach's greatest hits and is either a source of great pleasure to lovers of his work or the most boring film ever made you might prefer simply to listen to the recordings. Of course lacking in 'dramatic' structure it may also be the greatest film 'about' a classical composer ever made since the directors let nothing stand in the way of the music. In some quarters I have seen it described as a masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK I'll cut this a little slack for being made in 1968 though this does not fully excuse the horrible sound quality. Stereo became common 10 years before yet this is in mono with compressed overmodulated sometimes severely distorted sound recorded on an optical film track with background noise. I saw betterrecorded educational films shown on a 16mm projector in class as a kid. Hmmm maybe this was the audience for this project  an educational film for European music classes?On the plus side videos of musical performances were not as common as now I wish they were. It is interesting to see a performance especially keyboard or orchestral even if the camera is static. But you need firstrate sound... and color. This is filmed in black and white. I love black and white but this is washed out and fuzzy. I love classical music especially Bach. What makes Bach unique is not his use of melody which was more fully exploited later but his use of interweaving contrapuntal lines requiring the listener to follow multiple instruments simultaneously. This is largely lost in mono especially with this muddled sound. This makes me suspect that the producers didn't really understand the music. However at least having the visuals of the performers helps a bit to recapture some of that polyphonic interplay.The performances are adequate. But today with modern sound technology and the wide variety of performances and interpretations often on period instruments these performances seem hopelessly stodgy. The concept was not entirely off the mark filming Bach with period instruments performers dressed in period clothes with historical settings is interesting. It would have been more interesting with audiences for that's how the music would have been performed but then you would need more costumes. In color with digital sound this might have been striking but in black and white even the costumes are boring.".

I wouldn't even call it a movie. A better description might be a record of a few chamber concert pieces. As I recall the camera never even moved. Rather it just sat on a tripod for the entirety of each piece. The only attempts at dramatic effect were at the very end of each piece when the movie would cut to trees waving in the wind or little wavelets lapping at a beach. I'm sure the director would have preferred to have used footage of some really big crashing waves but the best he could find were a few inches high at some nearby lake and again using a stationary camera. Truly pathetic. I can't imagine how anyone could justify rating this movie higher than a five. When we walked out my father and I were completely mystified as to how it was possible to make such a bad movie. I don't know of of any good movies about Bach. The world really does need one but just because it doesn't exist is not a reason to see this one. Someone will make one someday. Until then just keep rewatching Amadeus.".

After watching this I do not a care a single bit more about Bach or his life than I did before watching the film. However I am not too surprised about this. The two filmmakers here are a very special brand of moviemaking and I personally find it difficult to make a connection with them as I have already found out while watching some of their older works.

For some reason Straub and Huillet's films keep showing up on lists of the greatest films of world cinema. They never should have taken up filmmaking because they have no desire to actually make movies. Instead they just want to point a camera at someone reading classical works of literature or shoot three hours of communist propaganda or in this case have someone perform Bach music while reading letters written by his wife. That's the thing that bugs me the most about their movies. I realize Straub and Huillet don't usually use actors in their films. But the least they could have done was require the people in the film to actually learn their lines. There is absolutely NOTHING entertaining about watching some guy in 18th Century dress READ his lines. This is common in all of their films. From Clouds to Resistance showed people reading poetry and classical literature while dressed like Greek gods. I don't mind the concept but why not have them learn the lines? Or at least hold up some cue cards? Every time I watch one of StraubHuillet's films I wonder why they didn't either make a documentary or better yet write a book? That would have totally suited their purposes much better than film as they have no concept of filmmaking. I feel like they are trying to share their love of classical music here and perhaps interest the audience in Bach. They failed miserably because they forgot the first rule of filmmaking TO ENTERTAIN. Once again they are so wrapped up in their own agenda they don't think about how the film will be perceived. Those who say this is a masterpiece are confused or just plain wrong. I have read countless reviews of Straub and Huillet's films where the reviewers confessed to not understanding what they were trying to do but gave it a thumbs up anyway. Not understanding something does not make it a masterpiece. These two rely on audience confusion to keep making movies. It's simply ludicrous. This is not a masterpiece. Just because you feel insecure for not finding it interesting or not understanding it does not make you any less of an intelligent person. It's ok to say this movie is dreck. It IS. You don't have to pretend this was interesting or engaging. It wasn't. Even the Bach fans have trouble sitting through this. My colleague is a music professor and HE could barely make it through. In fact he was insulted that these two directors managed to take a man who already had a horrible life but was a genius composer and make him mundane and boring. Bach fans should be outraged at this horrid rendition of his story.".

The zipping down of the women's voice that's supposed to be the wife and narrator reading at high speed about local happenings of 1738 Prussia is also not acceptable. Big disappointment!";

Coming Home is cited as an epic but despite the actordirector's best efforts it emerges as merely an overstuffed mediocre little film.Viewed a decade later its intentional topical tiein to the Iraq war has worn off and we're left with a slice of Americana which Brad did on a far better scale earlier in his career with Stephanie Swift in Crossroads. I like that rural genre citing Michael Raven's Adrenaline and Red Ezra's Roadblock as similar features. But with Coming Home Brad goes for smalltown America and war as he plays the lead character a reservist called up to go to Iraq with horrible consequences.I won't spoil the contrived main twist which doesn't happen until over 2 hours into the bloated 3hour feature. Many of the 10 lengthy sex scenes are extraneous typical of porn these days but not conducive to taking a film seriously. As if that weren't enough in the DVD Bonus section there's a Randy Spears sex scene with Gianna Lynn not in the final cut of the feature and Brad even talks in his BTS segment about how Randy as a tough drill sergeant is appearing for him in a non sex role nonsex either by design or mere hindsight.Despite its winning kneejerk acting awards for the two male leads I was quite unhappy with the casting. Brad as our hero is unappealing at this stage of his career Woody Allening his way to behind the camera emphasis but as revealed in the BTS unable to pass up the role he's written. Whether this is because no other director would want him anymore or just a selfish attitude toward his own project he wrote it the project evidently doesn't come first in his pecking order is a moot point.It's ultimately a vehicle for Wicked contract star Kirsten Price and she does a fine job as his wife torn between two loves. But as best buddy Barrett Blade is lousy as usual an actordirector who has yet to impress me in either department. As a sexy stud in a porn film he comes off about as appealing as if mainstream's Larry the Cable Guy were cast in such roles. On the flip side of that coin as his girlfriend Shyla Stylez misspelled here Styles is fine in bed and delivering anal sex to the package but her acting is not up to what's needed for such a big part.Most of the rest of the bigname cast is relegated to crappy assignments that could have been filled by anybody from Porn Central Casting. Exception is Vanessa Lane as a stripper extremely wellcast for her close resemblance to star Price.The war scene is an uninteresting staging with lots of gun flares and bullets flying but no excitement. Similarly the basic training is a dull montage of visual clichs. What we're left with is routine soap opera on the home front a disappointing ending Brad proclaims he's rejecting the Hollywood Ending approach but substitutes something worse and uninvolving sex footage. Worst acting razzie goes to Scott Lyons as Brad's brother reading his lines with so little conviction I was surprised his takes and the actor in toto were left in the final print. He's yet another awardwinning Adult actor with zero talent.".

Many veterans were on hand for the filming and they saw that they were taking part in something special. If they can draw a truce with Fonda than you can as well. The opening scene sets a tone for the film that it never veers from. A group of disabled vets play pool and directly confront each other over why they were there and what it all means. Director Hal Ashby RIP pulls no punches here. These vets aren't scholars debating on MacNeilLehrer. They struggle with these questions. They don't have the fancy initials after their names that impress people so much. There just the real people that fought the war.The rest of the film follows on this point. Special care goes into each character.Voights Luke Martin went to war to impress girls and feed his titanic ego. Because Ashby and his writers Waldo Salt Robert C. Jones and Nancy Dowd didn't back off on showing Luke's bad side it makes his transformation. He becomes a better person because he develops the strength to look inside himself.Bruce Dern gives an excellent performance as well in what is probably the trickiest part. Derns Bob Hyde is GI all the way but returns from his first combat detail in a state of turmoil. He sees the insanity first hand and quite frankly can't handle it. The nice thing here is that he's not simply disillusioned by the politics of the war but more by war itself. It's to this films credit that they didn't have Dern return home and  do an about face and start protesting. That story has been told. Instead once again we see a human being struggling to understand things that may be unknowable. What makes a man cut another man's ears off and throw them in his knapsack? How are you supposed to feel when your fellow soldiers are boiling the flesh off a human skull so they can mount it on a stake?Oddly enough Fondas character Sally Hyde may be the least political character in the film. Sure she sees injustices at the VA hospital and gets involved volunteering but this is merely as a novice. She asks very rudimentary questions about why the vets are being ignored but she asks as a sympathetic human being not an activist. As she eventually expands her horizons she changes from an officer's wife into a more mature woman. As this happens she falls in love with Voight. Neither person really wants it to happen. Voight doesn't want to betray a fellow soldier. Fonda doesn't want to betray her loyal husband. No easy answer.It's a shame that Coming Home occupies such a small niche in film history. It's a quiet thoughtful film that patiently tells its story. It doesn't have a single battle scene but it remains incredibly powerful. Robert Carradines breakdown while he plays his guitar and sings is a scene that should be taught in film school. Just one moment in an incredible film.Don't let this gem fade away.".

	schema:reviewBody "Without a single scene of combat footage this story manages to convey in realistically painful terms how much Vietnam scarred the landscape of America. And this is only a fictional viewpoint. The true life accounts must be gut wrenching. No one returned from the war the same person. To suggest a film be made showing an unaffected soldier would be incredibley unbelievable. When attitudes change and characters grow from harsh realities you can't help but be caught up in their struggle. People you would never expect to protest a US involved conflict or even question it did so with Vietnam. The Jane Fonda Sally character is such a person. She begins the picture somewhat naive easily trusting and sort of tied to her straight laced military existence as the wife of an enlisted man. But then she sees an entirely different world when he's gone and over months falls for his total opposite symbolizing how much she can never go back to the woman she was at the beginning. It's very subtle and deeply felt acting that can achieve this and both Fonda and Voight deserved their Oscars for their moving and expert performances. Bruce Dern is the hardest to sympathsize with on the surface but you realize he's been scarred by what he's seen too and what has happened to him in his absence so his world becomes more bitter as everything he once knew shatters around him. The 3 experiences his Voight's and Fonda's merge together at the end in a series of heartbreaking realizations until you're left as broken as the country was after the war.

	onyx:emotionText "Without a single scene of combat footage this story manages to convey in realistically painful terms how much Vietnam scarred the landscape of America. And this is only a fictional viewpoint. The true life accounts must be gut wrenching. No one returned from the war the same person. To suggest a film be made showing an unaffected soldier would be incredibley unbelievable. When attitudes change and characters grow from harsh realities you can't help but be caught up in their struggle. People you would never expect to protest a US involved conflict or even question it did so with Vietnam. The Jane Fonda Sally character is such a person. She begins the picture somewhat naive easily trusting and sort of tied to her straight laced military existence as the wife of an enlisted man. But then she sees an entirely different world when he's gone and over months falls for his total opposite symbolizing how much she can never go back to the woman she was at the beginning. It's very subtle and deeply felt acting that can achieve this and both Fonda and Voight deserved their Oscars for their moving and expert performances. Bruce Dern is the hardest to sympathsize with on the surface but you realize he's been scarred by what he's seen too and what has happened to him in his absence so his world becomes more bitter as everything he once knew shatters around him. The 3 experiences his Voight's and Fonda's merge together at the end in a series of heartbreaking realizations until you're left as broken as the country was after the war. You can't NOT be affected by what happened in Nam. It's impossible. And this film clearly shows why. It's the most personal and touching of Hollywood's Vietnam treatments. And certainly the deepest acted. Buy a copy and judge for yourself...";

The soundtrack is stunningnot only in the selection of songs from the period  by far the best film in this respect  but the subtle manner in which they are integrated into the film's soundtrack. The acting is good to excellent  Fonda Voigt and Carradine in particular.However my one complaint is with the Dern character. In this I speak from some personal experience as a vet with a tour of duty in Nam. This may be quibbling but...perhaps his contract had a clause prohibiting cutting his hair but the locks for a Marine captain are much too long. He would have received a direct order to get them cut . Also the close relationship between Dern and the sergeant is out of character. Marine Corps Captains did not hang out with E5 enlisted men. This is even more blatant in the scene after Dern's return from Nam when he goes out drinking and brings home three enlisted Marines. A Marine Corps Captain would not be drinking in uniform with enlisted men on or near the base  let alone bringing them home. I won't go into the problems I have with Dern's apparent and largely unexplained repulsion at what his men did in the field. However Dern aside the film itself has a very authentic feel to it and there are unforgettable scenes such as those in the VA hospital and Voigt's final speech to high school students as Tim Buckley's haunting One I Was can be heard in the background. In many respects this film is the direct antithesis of Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket which while visually authentic suffers from a lack of emotion.".

It attempts via narrative to correlate them to the cultural experiences of the public. It seems to try to offer insight into the collective trauma inflicted by the very idea that war as an institutional means of problem solving is an acceptable and patriotic belief that merits the sacrifice of our lives and sanity.

	schema:reviewBody "I'd seen this movie a couple of times the first time in the theater when it came out.At that time it seemed we'd learned a lesson about war. Viet Nam was over.So watching it again last night was even more poignant  did we really learn anything back then? I don't think this is a heavily politicized movie although it doesn't really show any positive effects of war doesn't say anything positive about fighting in Viet Nam. How could it really? They had the recruiter speaking at the high school about duty and honor and serving the country all true. But could he say about Viet Nam that we won or freed anyone? So showing an unflinching catalog of the aftermath of battle becomes antiwar simply because war is horrible. Very little dialog is devoted to telling us war is wrong. We can decide for ourselves based on what we see.Another comment says this One could actually describe the film as the 1970s' answer to William Wyler's The Best Years of Our Lives 1946.  That's an excellent point. Nothing was said in Best Years one of my favorite movies that was antiwar. In fact there is a scene in that film where the lead characters get in a fist fight with a man who says the war was a mistake. But we still saw the aftermath the horrible wounds inflicted the PTSD that they called shell shock back then the disruption in home life the difficulty resuming life at home. The film manages to tell the truth about war up to a point without being antiwar.Fonda's character does not become politicized. She wakes up to a certain extent but never takes a side on the issue. She supports her husband and hurts when he hurts. She supports Voight's character and hurts when he hurts. She's compassionate with the soldiers she encounters at her job. She never comments on whether Viet Nam was right or wrong. She only reacts to the pain she sees around her. Taking off her bra and letting her hair curl again dressing like a hippy aren't political statements about war. That was just the end of the 50'searly 60's mentality she'd been living under.Dern's character doesn't have a lot of screen time but what he does have is riveting. He's tormented. He has no opinion about whether the war is right or wrong only that war is awful.People can say what they want about Fonda but she plays this one pretty close to the vest. Her character never says Gee we shouldn't have gone to Viet Nam. She reacts with compassion not judgment or recrimination.I don't necessarily like Fonda in most films but her turn in this one is excellent. Voight and Dern are likewise excellent making us feel the confusion anger and pain of their characters.A classic movie that everyone should see.".

	schema:headline " Not worth the bones of a single US Marine";
	schema:reviewBody "During the Vietnam War itself Hollywood tended to shy away from making films about it John Wayne's patriotic drama The Green Berets being one of the few exceptions. It was not until a few years after the withdrawal of American forces that filmmakers started to take a serious look at the conflict. Coming Home forms part of the First Great Vietnam Cycle coming out in the same year 1978 as Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter and a year before Coppola's Apocalypse Now. There was to be a second cycle of films about Vietnam including Platoon and Full Metal Jacket in the late eighties and early nineties.Unlike The Deer Hunter or Apocalypse Now Coming Home is entirely set in America with no scenes of the actual conflict. It deals with what in earlier wars would have been called the Home Front. It tells story of Sally Hyde the wife of Bob an officer in the Marine Corps who is away fighting in Vietnam. During her husband's absence Sally works as a volunteer in a military hospital where she meets an old classmate Luke Martin. Luke has also fought in Vietnam but is now paralysed after being injured in action.Following his experiences in the war Luke has become bitter and angry and campaigns vehemently against America's involvement in the war. Sally and Luke rekindle their old friendship and eventually a sexual relationship develops between them. His injuries do not seem to have affected Luke's sexual capabilities. The character of Luke is said to have been based upon Ron Kovic a reallife veteran whom Jane Fonda got to know while campaigning against the war. Kovic's story was to be told about a decade later in the film Born on the Fourth of July.Even after Hollywood started making films about Vietnam it always had difficulties with the subject. American films on the subject have generally taken a vaguely antiwar line but with the brave exception of Oliver Stone's Heaven and Earth have always approached it from an American perspective. If the Vietnamese people appear at all it is normally either as faceless enemies or as innocent civilian victims of war.Coming Home is perhaps the most Americacentric of all fatally handicapped by the quite deliberate decision not to show us anything of the country where the actual fighting was taking place. The film was doubtless intended as an antiwar statement but it never really works as such. It never quite has the courage to take up the absolutist pacifist position which says that no cause however ostensibly noble is worth killing or dying for. Instead the message that comes across is this faraway country of which we knew nothing was not worth the bones of a single US Marine. In the context of Vietnam that position might have been an arguable one but this movie shies away from any attempt to analyse the causes of the war or the reasons why either the Americans or the Vietnamese whether pro or antiCommunist were fighting.Instead of rational analysis the film relies on emotional war is hell clichs. Indeed when Bob returns from the war only slightly injured physically but traumatised psychologically it was perhaps responsible for inventing a new clich the emotionally damaged Vietnam vet. Reallife soldiers suffer from psychological trauma in all wars fictional ones only do so in wars of which the author or scriptwriter disapproves. There were doubtless many veterans of World War II who were left emotionally scarred by their experiences but because bienpensant opinion across the political spectrum holds that they were fighting the good fight against Fascism not too many films get made about them. Incidentally I wonder if this stereotyping of Vietnam veterans as psychotic mental cases actually made it more difficult for real vets to return to civilian society.The film could perhaps have worked as an apolitical human drama but for me it never really works on this level either. We never really understand why Sally hitherto portrayed as a wholesome loving allAmerican housewife devoted to her husband should have started an affair with Luke. She never seems passionately in love with him and has no intention of leaving her husband for him. Doutbless she feels sorry for him but sympathy and adultery are two different things. I have never agreed with those Oscars for Jane Fonda and Jon Voight although Voight's ranting performance was the sort that always impresses the Academy especially as he was playing a disabled character. 1978 was a rather weak year in cinema history so great performances were thin on the ground but I felt that Best Actor should have gone to Robert de Niro for The Deer Hunter and Best Actress to Ellen Burstyn for Same Time Next Year. The best acting contribution here probably comes from Bruce Dern even though his long hair and straggly moustache makes him look more like a hippie than a Marine officer.Of the year's two Vietnam epics The Deer Hunter is by far the better. Cimino's film has its faults but it also has its virtues including some stunning photography and a genuine emotional power. Coming Home by contrast is a dull slowmoving soapopera about people some of whom just happen to have fought in Vietnam. 410".

	schema:reviewBody "'Coming Home' is a very powerful and meaningful film but it was released the same year as 'The Deer Hunter' and that absolutely annihilated it when it came Oscar season. 'Coming Home' is a great film but it is no where near as brilliant as Michael Cimino's onehit wonder 'Deer Hunter'. Despite this competition 'Coming Home' managed to win two Academy Awards for the lead actors  Jon Voight and Jane Fonda. 'Coming Home' is the story of a beautiful bright yet very understanding military wife Sally Hyde Fonda who is married to the marine poster boy Captain Bob Hyde Bruce Dern  Black Sunday. Bob goes off to fight in Vietnam leaving Sally with nothing to do but worry. Instead of sitting at home and eating bonbons Sally and her best friend Vi Penelope Milford volunteer at a Veternan's hospital where Sally is reunited with an old high school acquaintance Luke Martin Voight who was a sergeant in Vietnam but know can't walk. The two become great friends but eventually lovers which comes to a boil when Captain Bob returns home after a couple years of fighting. The film also stars Robert Carradine and Charlie Cyphers. Hal Ashby does a fine job directing this picture and Robert C. Jones and Waldo Salt provide a powerful screenplay. Jon Voight steals the picture which his heartwrenching portrayal of a physically and emotionally scarred war veteran who reflects on his time spent in 'Nam and just wishes the war would end. Voight was great and won an Oscar but I felt DeNiro deserved it more for his similar role in 'The Deer Hunter'. Jane Fonda rightfully won her Oscar for Leading Actress as the caring king and understanding Sally who always wants to help someone and Bruce Dern is powerful in the role of Captain Hyde especially in the last fifteen minutes of the film. Besides winning two Oscars for the leading actors 'Coming Home' was nominated for six other Academy Awards including Best Picture Best Director Best Supporting Actor  Bruce Dern Best Supporting Actress  Penelope Milford Best Original Screenplay which it ended up actually winning and Best Film Editing. It is a wonderful motion picture but not quite on the level with the 'The Deer Hunter'. I recommend it for anyone who appreciates incredible acting and filmmaking. Grade B".

	schema:reviewBody "Coming Home's story the barebones of it could be the kind of story one could find for a dime a dozen from the 40's and 50's love in war or rather after war crossed with a certain infidelity aspect. But Hal Ashby's film one of his best doesn't go for any easy answers. This is Vietnam after all and it was for the Americans that went there more often than not a truly traumatic experience. One can look at this film as an allegory or even just a straight on love story but the filmmaker goes past the possible clichs by presenting what goes on in a heartbreaking manner at times even to bleak existential extents without being overly sentimental. Not that there isn't sentiment which is different than the kind of sentimentality that can be found on any given Lifetime film. Beneath the bright lighting in a many of the scenes via the great Haskell Wexler is a dark feeling around the characters there might be hope somewhere but can it come out of being crippled for life? The acting is what elevates a very good script into the territory of being gripping as one reviewer on IMDb said 'without forcing it'. Jon Voight as Luke Martin a man paralyzed from the waist down spends the first third of the story trying without much luck dealing with his newly imposed state. This is some of the best acting Voight's ever done even as it could go over the edge of the overacting of his ailments. Then as the film goes along and he does start to come to terms with himself through his new friend the performance subtly becomes more revelatory leading up to a final speech that's even more brave than truthful there's a choice to be made is just as strong a statement as anything in Apocalypse Now. His new friend as it turns out is a wife of a marine Bruce Dern Sally played by Jane Fonda. She can't stand him at first of course but then their relationship evolves into something deeper than even I could grasp at first. It's more than an affair it's a tale of lonely people who come closer together.However this last sentence might sound though it's dealt with a pathos that doesn't pander to the audience. There are little scenes that even have humor like in the Veteran's hospital Sally works at or in the middle part of the film which is usually a 'softy' part of these love stories. When Ashby deals with the sexual content as well it's all the more truthful intimate and in tune with the testingofthewaters subject matter. And there are two other aspects that make it a different fascinating film. No musical score in line with Scorsese and Lucas and others the soundtrack is filled with the Rolling Stones great song selection and usage by the way Bob Dylan the Beatles and so forth and it adds splendidly to the atmosphere of scenes giving them a certain lightness or depth. Then there's the performance by Bruce Dern. Though Voight and Fonda won deserved Oscars for their work Dern's work is even more deserved even more soulful in its time. He's not onscreen for long but when he has his scenes post Vietnam experience it's just as disturbing as with Voight's scenes there's a masterful scene with Dern and Fonda in a scene towards the end of the film. It's his character in a way that does get in the way of the sort of traditional love story between Voight and Fonda and it works. The two stars are stars but Dern is a character actor through and through and this is one of his very best pieces of work. Like The Last Detail my favorite of Ashby's films I've seen to date who knows if Being There or Harold and Maude may change that Coming Home is a tale of characters from an era of confusion of feeling resentment and sorrow at what the establishment has done to its 'baby boomers'. And best of all it doesn't outlive its years. The themes dealt with here the personal trauma of life after possible death and the truths behind not even the lies of war but the shroud of the gungho John Wayne mentality go alongside other memorable films from the era. It may not appeal right off to the diehards of Apocalypse Now or the Deer Hunter or Born on the 4th of July as it has a relationship story entwined in the main subject. Yet it shouldn't be passed over in the years to come as it makes for good viewing for others looking to join up in today's military.".

The acting is what elevates a very good script into the territory of being gripping as one reviewer on IMDb said 'without forcing it'. Jon Voight as Luke Martin a man paralyzed from the waist down spends the first third of the story trying without much luck dealing with his newly imposed state. This is some of the best acting Voight's ever done even as it could go over the edge of the overacting of his ailments. Then as the film goes along and he does start to come to terms with himself through his new friend the performance subtly becomes more revelatory leading up to a final speech that's even more brave than truthful there's a choice to be made is just as strong a statement as anything in Apocalypse Now. His new friend as it turns out is a wife of a marine Bruce Dern Sally played by Jane Fonda. She can't stand him at first of course but then their relationship evolves into something deeper than even I could grasp at first. It's more than an affair it's a tale of lonely people who come closer together.However this last sentence might sound though it's dealt with a pathos that doesn't pander to the audience. There are little scenes that even have humor like in the Veteran's hospital Sally works at or in the middle part of the film which is usually a 'softy' part of these love stories. When Ashby deals with the sexual content as well it's all the more truthful intimate and in tune with the testingofthewaters subject matter. And there are two other aspects that make it a different fascinating film. No musical score in line with Scorsese and Lucas and others the soundtrack is filled with the Rolling Stones great song selection and usage by the way Bob Dylan the Beatles and so forth and it adds splendidly to the atmosphere of scenes giving them a certain lightness or depth. Then there's the performance by Bruce Dern. Though Voight and Fonda won deserved Oscars for their work Dern's work is even more deserved even more soulful in its time. He's not onscreen for long but when he has his scenes post Vietnam experience it's just as disturbing as with Voight's scenes there's a masterful scene with Dern and Fonda in a scene towards the end of the film. It's his character in a way that does get in the way of the sort of traditional love story between Voight and Fonda and it works. The two stars are stars but Dern is a character actor through and through and this is one of his very best pieces of work. Like The Last Detail my favorite of Ashby's films I've seen to date who knows if Being There or Harold and Maude may change that Coming Home is a tale of characters from an era of confusion of feeling resentment and sorrow at what the establishment has done to its 'baby boomers'. And best of all it doesn't outlive its years. The themes dealt with here the personal trauma of life after possible death and the truths behind not even the lies of war but the shroud of the gungho John Wayne mentality go alongside other memorable films from the era. It may not appeal right off to the diehards of Apocalypse Now or the Deer Hunter or Born on the 4th of July as it has a relationship story entwined in the main subject. Yet it shouldn't be passed over in the years to come as it makes for good viewing for others looking to join up in today's military.";

The actors are all at least adequate with Bruce Dern being the most successful. The whole thing might work a ton better if it weren't for the execrable pop music score. I mean the songs are good of course but they're used so poorly. For example the morning when Dern is shipping off to Vietnam the lyrics to the song that begins are it was a time of innocence. I'm disappointed in Ashby. By no means is he a great director but he made some great movies. He really tries to tug at your heart strings. After one character dies Ashby closes the next scene by tightening the camera on his guitar because you know we have to be told what to feel or we won't feel it. SPOILERS. I think that the love triangle plot is quite good but despite a pretty good climactic scene the ending is just awful. They kill off the husband and leave Fonda alone for Voight. I think that's morally lazy skirting the emotional complexities. Skip this and see The Deer Hunter instead. Despite some of the deserved flack that it has gotten in recent years it's very well made. At the very least it beats the heck out of Coming Home.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll be the bad guy and add a negative review for Coming Home to this collection of glowing reviews.  I'll stay away from the very sensitive backdrop which I have no problem with and concentrate on the storyline and performances.  Why is it that if a lead character in a film is in a hospital or asylum they have to act like an obnoxious prick no matter what the circumstances?  Then through some sort of bonding with either a new patient or outside character their angry facade is melted away and their true sweet nature comes out?  This is the standard formula that these type of films always seem to follow and this one is no exception.  Jon Voight's transformation in this film is remarkable.  One minute he's a psychotic invalid confined rolling on a bed then the next minute he's mister happy go lucky rolling around in a wheelchair and not a vestage of his psychotic self is seen the rest of the film.  Not very good storytelling nor is the haphazard way the film jumps around not really focusing on anything.I really didn't feel anything for either Voight's character or Dern's.  They portray their characters for the most part with no real depth.  I see Voight as just a soldier who had a mishap.  Same with Dern.  They could have had these mishaps in the US.  Even though we know they happened in Vietnam they really don't provide us with any mental connection that they've suffered some kind of Vietnam trauma.   That would be OK if it weren't what the film is supposed to be about.  The Best Years of Our Lives is a great film and one of my favorites.  The Deer Hunter is also a great film.  Both of them like Coming Home focus on war veterans returning home.  Best Years is moving in a sentimental way while Deer Hunter is moving in a shocking horrible way.  I was not the least bit moved by Coming Home because I think it just stayed in the middle of those two extremes and never strayed close to either one.Jane Fonda is a very mediocre actress and this is a typical performance of hers.  She is the atypical actress meaning she always seems like she's acting.  I'm never convinced her words and actions are real including and especially her love for either of these men.  Again I just don't care what happened to this love triangle in the end because I never bought any love in the first place.  As for Bruce Dern's performance I've seen better acting in commercials.This film is also praised for it's music.  While I thought the songs were fine for the film I had a real problem with the way they were used in the film.  I found it very distracting to have an entire song played while scenes of dialogue were taking place.  There's a reason why music is used in film the way it has always been used  for transition and emotion.  It just doesn't seem possible to get lost in a scene or in dialogue between two characters when you can hear nanananananana Hey Jude over and over in the background.  Music in film was just not meant to be used this way. It may have been an interesting experiment but in my opinion it just doesn't work.SPOILER ALERT  Finally the film really lost me in the end.  Again I may be sort of traditional when it comes to how I like my movies but I think there simply has to be some sort of resolution or wrap up in the end.  Not so much the speech that Jon Voight is giving which is one of the films better scenes but the shots of Jane Fonda going to the grocery store and the A Star Is Bornesqe demise of Bruce Dern's character.  Give me a break. At least James Mason and Fredric March gave us a reason for their suicide. What's Dern's reason?Overall I just found the film uninvolving and the performances mediocre. The dialogue between the veterans at the beginning and Voight's speech at the end raise some very good points and it would have been nice to feel some of those effects during the crux of the film and not to see some inane love story that if you think about it really has little to do with the after effects of the war.C".

	schema:headline " Classic though uninspiring Vietnam War love triangle";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie when it first came out and as a tremendous Jane Fonda fan and with my typical youthful attitudes I loved it. However a quarter century of marriage has matured some of my thinking.The film tells the story of Sally Hyde Jane Fonda whose husband Bruce Dern is a gunho marine off fighting the Vietnam War. While he's away Sally tries to make herself useful by volunteering in a local veterans' hospital where she encounters an old school friend Luke Jon Voight. Luke has been scarred both physically he's paralyzed in a wheelchair and psychologically by the war. Sally finds herself drawn to Luke and then is forced to deal with the return of her husband who is himself suffering from his own trauma not only from combat but also from discovering his wife's infidelity.On the positive side the movie does show war's ravages both physical and mental on returning vets both the husband here and the lover. Also I will admit Luke's character is a sympathetic one and the love scene between him and Sally is sensitively portrayed.I am no advocate of war. However in keeping with Jane Fonda's well known sentiments this movie has a pretty typical war protest message. How many viewers who loved this film would feel very sympathetic these days toward the wife whose husband is deployed in Iraq if he were to discover upon his return that she had been carrying on with another vet? Call me old fashioned here but Sally Hyde unfortunately seems to have a little more compassion for her lover than her husband. Of course the husband must be portrayed as hawkish in order for us to sympathize with Sally's actions and not cast her as the villain of the piece. Also it's quite superficial to simply kill off the husband at the end so Sally need not make any difficult decisions. She can end up happily with her lover Luke admittedly the more likable and sympathetic of the pair and still come off as a decent individual and reasonable wife intending no disloyalty but simply victimized by the circumstances of war. Note to screenwriters...killing off one of the parties in a love triangle is cheating and dumbs down both the plot and character portrayal!Still it's a sort of classic antiwar period piece I guess and I wouldn't mind seeing it again out of nostalgia. Lots of 1960's rock music Beatles Rolling Stones etc. in the background. Some reviewers complain too much music though I enjoyed it. Finally the Vietnam War may have been futile or wrong but would viewers react to this love triangle the same way if it had been World War II? I think not.".

A little slice of pacifism from director Hal Ashby cinema's lovable hippie and antiwar advocate the film avoids most clichs though like most Western war films it does ultimately ignore the larger mechanics of the conflict. In a war which saw millions of Vietnamese murdered Coming Home's preoccupied with yet another suffering American soldier. 8.510  Worth two viewings.";

Their friendship blossoms into an affair and then back to a friendship again once they both realize that they can't continue on as lovers.The film is brilliantly acted by both Voight and Fonda and both deservedly won Oscars for their performances. Bruce Dern was also nominated for his role and while The Deer Hunter is a brilliant film did not deserve the award in 1978 for Best Picture. Robert Carradine also gives one of the best performances of his career and somehow managed to parlay it into the Revenge of the Nerds franchise. Hey we're not all born smart I guess.Loosely based on Ron Kovic's life the film explores the effects of Vietnam not only on the body but the mind and delves into how people can heal each other just by offering their time and attention to each other. Voight does a far better job than Cruise Born on the 4th of July in capturing the emotional impact of a devastating and permanent war injury. He serves as the allwise and all knowing veteran who has seen the war for what it is while Dern plays the part of the gung ho soldier marching off to battle. Fonda holds the story together as a woman caught between the two worlds of early 1960s nationalism and late 1960s disillusionment. Hal Ashby scored a number of wins in the 1970's but this film is his crowning achievement. A must see for any war film or history buff.Doc StrangeAnd the Losers Are".

I hated it so badly that I even considered walking out on it something I have never done. But it was so awful i was almost compelling. I just had to sit through to the end. Much like some early80's Stallone action reel this one REALLY takes Swedish action back to the stoneage. So full of logical errors and stupid mistakes it is almost amusing  but who could ever see anything good in the terrible acting Mark Hamill's surviving a minefield or the dumbass useless and irrational action?Let me ask you aren't we through with clocks ticking down to zero the hero escaping in the nick of time and two friends become enemies reuniting by the end? STUPID!!!!And one more thing the product placement in this film is unbelievable. While other countries have understood that it shouldn't be so OBVIOUS the Swedish film industry apparently hasn't understood at all just look at the credit card Hamilton uses to open a window? Or or or.... this film really makes me mad.".

Lousy acting technique.Stormare also flinches sometimes when he fires a gun turning his head away and clamping his eyes shut. Watch carefully. James Bond can rest easy with competition like this.There are some interesting supporting performances from other actors but not enough to hang a whole movie on. The cinematography is goodlooking doing a fine job of capturing the Nordic cold. Even the Sahara winds up looking cold. Perhaps Hamilton carries his own climate with him.There are some individual good action sequences here. Unfortunately the only sense of humor on screen belongs to the villain which turns the hero into a big pill. James Bond's jokes may not be particularly good but at least he doesn't look constipated all the time.One positive point in the movie's favor is that the psychotic contorted vicious hatred of Israel in Guillou's books has been left out. What has been kept in is worship of a noble heroic PLO that he shows us functioning in Libya without the dictator Khaddafi's knowledge or supervision. This fantasy is hard to believe since Khaddafi actually threw the PLO out of Libya for four years at a time. And at the end of the film Hamilton gives the PLO a very disturbing gift. Where will they use that gift? Hamilton doesn't care.We're a long long way away from For Whom the Bell Tolls here.Commander Hamilton will remain a local phenomenon. While Henning Mankell's books sell well around the world Jan Guillou will never have the same success.As for this film bleeeeaaahhhhh.".

Davis finds Brodie to be a brooding reclusive drunk haunted by his experiences on the island and Brodie tells Davis that it isn't worth mounting a rescue mission as the survivors will by now be dead. Brodie however decides to tag along bringing along a veritable arsenal of weapons and a fatalistic attitude ridiculing Davis' plans as naive. Accompanying them is Tara Matthews a young woman purporting to be a medic and Davis' secondincommand Eddie Mendoza a downtoearth practical man who very quickly realizes Brodie knows what he is doing and is inclined to believe what the man says. ...";

	schema:reviewBody "Say what you will but this engaging and cruddy little film has at least one major thing going for it Mr. Ron Perlman the hardest working most underrated man to cruise the Bmovie circuit since Brad Dourif. Plus it's got a delicious monologue from the requisite mad scientist.Radical? I will show them 'radical'! As modern TV movies go Primal Force is more of a throwback to an age when even the loosest most derivative stories were set to celluloid with an intense determination and the utmost of integrity...no cheap shots or metajokes.

Secondly I think that the actors know this is a silly movieI think the director knows this is a silly movie but they have fun with it and that is what really matters. I think the special EFx are energetic and reminiscent of a time long gone. Of course the film is very silly and not for people who want to see a serious flick this is very much a Saturday night B movie. See this flick if you can find it if you like cheesy B movies with some class. Skip it if you hate cheesy B movies about killer animals. 810".

Well you'de think they would make them look mutant... indeed some good costume design and effects work could possibly have saved the movie... but instead they simply make the baboons look like well your every day baboon. All in all Primal Force is clearly an attempt at Jurrassic Park only with men in monkey suits. It's irredeemably inept scripting and it's dull and predictable plot developments make it one of the worst of the generally dire 'evil creatures' films. Please don't waste your life watching this.

There is a knock on Frank's door he answers it  standing before him is a guy named Scott Davis Mark Kiely who has been told that he knows San Miguel Island better than anyone else  that he needs his help to lead a rescue mission as a plane recently crashed there. Eventually Brodie agrees together with a female medic named Tara Matthews Roxana Zal a computer guy named Stan Kovacs Julian Sedgwick  Eddie Mendoza Guillermo Rios who carries a gun gets in the way  does very little else they set off for San Miguel Island. Meanwhile on the Island itself the three survivors the pilot Jimy Hefner a real estate guy named Deutsch Richard Fancy  a pretty young girl named Kelsey Cunningham Kimberlee Peterson whose Father is interested in buying the Island are deciding what to do when a group of vicious genetically altered Baboons kill the pilot. Kelsey  Deutsch just sort of run away. Our heavily armed group of rescuers lead by Brodie arrive on the Island via boat. Scott feels Brodie is withholding some information but they troop on regardless of all the human  animal skulls they find. They find Kelsey  Deutsch but they are all attacked by the genetic Baboons. The Baboons now know they're on the Island  will stop at nothing to kill the intruders as Brodie has to use his experience  firepower to keep everyone alive with varying degrees of success. If that wasn't enough the guy Bruno Danza driving the boat has buggered off leaving them stranded  the Baboons have killed Kovacs  destroyed the radio equipment. As the survivors run low on ammo  morale they decide to fight back against the Baboons!Directed by Nelson McCormick I thought Primal Force was an OK time waster but nothing that overly impressed me. The script by Micheal Thoma is about as clichd as you expect of this sort of low budget TV production. First the characters there's the moody unshaven hero with personal demons to exorcise but turns out be be a throughly decent chap in the end the clean cut hero the computer whizz the tough female character the token nobody who is there to die  nothing else just so something happens  the character who has other more mysterious motives for being on the Island. The innocent plane crash victims aren't any better with the young pretty girl who screams a lot  the annoying selfish fat guy who doesn't care about anyone but himself. Then there's the story a group becomes stranded in an isolated location  can't call for help sound familiar? Group encounter living threat that wants to kill them all for no real reason at all group run low on ammo even though they never actually run out  have to come up with other ways to defeat their enemy in a nailbiting not climax been done yeah? Genetic experiments gone wrong. One character who gets abducted by the enemy  is not killed for some unexplained reason unlike everyone else who are killed on sight. You probably get the message. Having said all that for what it is I thought Primal Force was OK  rolled out the clichs with a certain degree of entertainment value. Ron Pearlman as the muscle bound wise cracking Brodie is great  almost makes Primal Force worth watching on his own everyone else is utterly forgettable. Unfortunately one area where Primal Force loses a couple of stars is in the violence department basically it hasn't got any. This was obviously made with a fairly young teenage audience in mind as the blood gore  nastiness is kept to an absolute minimum. The killer Baboons are just people in monkey suits nothing particularly spectacular. Technically Primal Force is OK it's very MTV in style with quick cuts jerky hand held camera movements during the attacks slow motion bleached colours  every other flashy pointless trick you can think of. On the plus side the Mexican locations on occasion look stunning  a few nice shots here  there captures it well. Overall Primal Force isn't particularly good but it ain't particularly bad either just sort of average  I think a decent helping of blood  gore would have helped no end to improve it!".

	schema:reviewBody "When a civilian plane crashes on a deserted Mexican island a rescue team is put together and leader Scott Davis goes to Frank Brodie for help as Brodie supposedly has the most knowledge of this uncharted island. While the pilot of the crashed plane comes to an immediate sticky end the other two survive and await rescue. When the team reaches them Brody opens fire on an unseen menace killing a large baboon in the process. Brodie then explains that these baboons have been bred to kill a fact he didn't think to mention before going to the island and the team find themselves quickly becoming the prey of a species of baboon that have been developed to be hunters and killers.The concept is not anything new and I'm not one to judge  it might have worked if it had been given the chance. Who knows with the right mood and effort put into it this film may have been a gripping little thriller. Sadly as it is everything conspires to make this boring flat and lacking any real atmosphere at all. The plot is lacking any sense of logic and it doesn't even try to really explain anything to a satisfactory level preferring instead just to try and quickly get things out and move past them. This is not a major problem though if the film had really delivered the goods in terms of pace and action but here it falls down too. The threat of the baboons changes to meet the requirements of the film  one minute they are seconds away next they are just on the edges waiting for our characters to finish preparing for their attack. The attacks are a mess of quick cuts and the film never makes the baboons produce a constant tension or pace. In between these poor attacks the dialogue and characters are poor and totally failed to engage me on any level.The director uses zoom ins to try and generate excitement but he fails likewise his use of quick cuts feels gimmicky and forced. The cast mostly struggle to come across as excited in the face of all this and few make much of an impact. Perlman is such a gruff presence that he is nearly always worth seeing  in fact he was the reason I thought I'd give it a go. Here he did what I expected and was quite good despite the material but he is on his own with a supporting cast of fillers and bythenumbers performances. Kiely is a standard action man while none of Zal Peterson Rios etc make any mark at all and I never cared about any of them.Overall this is a standard film that has nothing really going for it. Perlman is better than the film deserves but nothing else really stands up to be counted the baboons are never a consistent threat the direction is flat and uninspired while the cast are mostly TV actors running around trying to look scared. Not really worth seeing unless you are a massive Perlman fan.".

This is not a major problem though if the film had really delivered the goods in terms of pace and action but here it falls down too. The threat of the baboons changes to meet the requirements of the film  one minute they are seconds away next they are just on the edges waiting for our characters to finish preparing for their attack. The attacks are a mess of quick cuts and the film never makes the baboons produce a constant tension or pace. In between these poor attacks the dialogue and characters are poor and totally failed to engage me on any level.The director uses zoom ins to try and generate excitement but he fails likewise his use of quick cuts feels gimmicky and forced. The cast mostly struggle to come across as excited in the face of all this and few make much of an impact. Perlman is such a gruff presence that he is nearly always worth seeing  in fact he was the reason I thought I'd give it a go. Here he did what I expected and was quite good despite the material but he is on his own with a supporting cast of fillers and bythenumbers performances. Kiely is a standard action man while none of Zal Peterson Rios etc make any mark at all and I never cared about any of them.Overall this is a standard film that has nothing really going for it. Perlman is better than the film deserves but nothing else really stands up to be counted the baboons are never a consistent threat the direction is flat and uninspired while the cast are mostly TV actors running around trying to look scared. Not really worth seeing unless you are a massive Perlman fan.";

	schema:headline " Lenzi's masterful giallo";
	schema:reviewBody "Seven Blood Stained Orchids Sette orchidee macchiate di rosso 1971 is extremely pleasant and atmospheric Italian mystery giallo from the beginning of the 70's. Lenzi himself likes this film too but doesn's think it is his masterpiece. I have not seen too much of his work I have seen at least Cannibal Ferox Mangiati Vivi! and Il Paese del sesso selvaggio but when I saw this 70's classic I knew that Lenzi is at his best in this genre.Murders take place and soon the main character starts to notice some connections and relations between the murdered ones. Couple of years ago something evil happened and now it seems to be payback time.This is almost as masterful as Argento's Profondo Rosso in the suspense department. Argento's work is more stylish and artistic but Lenzi is definitely not less interesting or less skilled. Couple of scenes are very scary and shocking especially if the film is viewed alone in the dark..Music by Riz Ortolani is great but not as great as in Cannibal Holocaust or La Casa sperduta nel parco by Ruggero Deodato.In these giallos there is always pretty confusing and nonbelievable plot but it doesn's matter because these films don't have to be realistic they can be supernatural as well and it doesn't diminish their impact. Plot in this film isn't too confusing but many twists and turns take place during the film.Seven Blood Stained Orchids is highly recommended for Italo fanatics and horror fans alike. Lenzi directed his most notorious cannibal films only because of money so these mystery films are far more personal and artistic too. And the lead lady character played by Uschi Glas is unbelievably charming and sexy and she is very nice to watch.8 out of 10 and recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't get the praise for this one at all. It is one of the first of these Italian horror thrillers giallo I have watched and color me unimpressed. Antonio Sabato and Uschi Glas star as newlyweds caught in the middle of a psychopath's killing spree. Well actually she's caught in the middle and he's just deciding to spend his free time playing Sherlock Holmes since the cops on the case are incompetent. Glas' character along with six other females are the targets and the killer knows that one of these seven ladies was involved in a car accident that left a man dead. Since he cannot prove which lady was involved he decides to murder them all to get his revenge. This movie plays out like a bland madeforTV thriller with stale dialogue unimaginative direction a weakly written screenplay and a few supposed twists thrown in but it's all rather mundane and formulaic. The identity of the killer is a huge disappointment also because all they do is make it one of those minor characters who has maybe one scene before he's is revealed to be the psycho. The person isn't sufficiently developed or menacing enough to build much interest and everyone who appears in a major role is nondescript and dull. Most of the run time is uninteresting dialogue scenes that constantly make the film come to a screeching halt. It's not thrilling scary or suspenseful at all. And that is a shame because I normally love Italian horrors and thrillers. Many are among the most beautifully made films I have seen with good casts outstanding cinematography creepy music scores and wonderful art direction and sets. Sadly this very dull movie has no style to speak of and the well of imagination must have run dry.".

	schema:reviewBody "These Italian horror directors never cease to surprise their fans don't you agree? No matter how notorious they are for extremely gore and gutmunching films they nearly always started out with genuinely creepy and wellplotted gialli! Lucio Fulci has his Don't Torture a Duckling Dario Argento initially made The Bird with Crystal Plumage and even Umberto Lenzi infamous for his nasty and downright repulsive cannibal flicks like Cannibal Ferox Nightmare City and Eaten Alive stunned us with the delicious Giallo Seven Blood Stained Orchids. THIS is the kind of horror that reminds my why I love the genre so much! Seven Blood Stained Orchids the title alone is exciting stands for mystery and suspense from start to finish atmospherically filmed by Lenzi and provided with a chilling musical score by Riz Ortolani Cannibal Holocaust. The idea is based on an Edgar Wallace novel and tells the unbelievable yet truly intriguing story of a blackgloved murderer with seven beautiful women on his hit list. Initially it seems that there's absolutely no relation between all these women and the only thing that brings them together is the symbol of a half moon which the anonymous killer leaves behind on their bodies as a trademark. After a few murders the police still know absolutely nothing about the identity or the possible motives of this madman so one of the victims' fiance starts his own investigation. The killer believes his third target is dead but she survived the knifeattack and she even begins to remember what the seven girls might have in common The story is complex and every new clue or plot twist comes as a complete surprise to the main characters as well as to you the viewer. No matter how badly you attempt to unravel the mystery before Mario does you're in the dark about this dangerous madman as much as anyone else. A constant hightension level and a solid premise are Lenzi's biggest trumps here since the movie is pretty low on budget and scenery. The actual murders are a bit tame but suggestive enough and the bonus for patient gorefanatics comes near the end when an unfortunate girl is literally drilled to death. The thing I like most about gialli is that they're beautiful to look at and nearly always handled with an unusually large amount of style and elegance. Even though you wouldn't give it to him considering his vicious reputation Umberto Lenzi also proves himself to be a master in this as Seven Blood Stained Orchids contains several downright beautiful sequences. Although it has to be said that the cast also contributes a great deal to the beautyelement. All seven women come close to being goddesses especially Marisa Mell who even plays two roles! Italycult freaks will definitely remember this girl from Mario Bava's psychedelic masterpiece Danger Diabolik!. This film is a must for everyone who ever showed interest in undiscovered horror highlights. This belongs to the category of films that truly define the brilliance and range of horror.".

Initially it seems that there's absolutely no relation between all these women and the only thing that brings them together is the symbol of a half moon which the anonymous killer leaves behind on their bodies as a trademark. After a few murders the police still know absolutely nothing about the identity or the possible motives of this madman so one of the victims' fiance starts his own investigation. The killer believes his third target is dead but she survived the knifeattack and she even begins to remember what the seven girls might have in common The story is complex and every new clue or plot twist comes as a complete surprise to the main characters as well as to you the viewer. No matter how badly you attempt to unravel the mystery before Mario does you're in the dark about this dangerous madman as much as anyone else. A constant hightension level and a solid premise are Lenzi's biggest trumps here since the movie is pretty low on budget and scenery. The actual murders are a bit tame but suggestive enough and the bonus for patient gorefanatics comes near the end when an unfortunate girl is literally drilled to death. The thing I like most about gialli is that they're beautiful to look at and nearly always handled with an unusually large amount of style and elegance. Even though you wouldn't give it to him considering his vicious reputation Umberto Lenzi also proves himself to be a master in this as Seven Blood Stained Orchids contains several downright beautiful sequences. Although it has to be said that the cast also contributes a great deal to the beautyelement. All seven women come close to being goddesses especially Marisa Mell who even plays two roles! Italycult freaks will definitely remember this girl from Mario Bava's psychedelic masterpiece Danger Diabolik!. This film is a must for everyone who ever showed interest in undiscovered horror highlights. This belongs to the category of films that truly define the brilliance and range of horror.";

Two star increase in rating would seem appropriate.'Watching this again after several years I was surprised to remember little other than that I had thought more of it before. I suspect that it was an early giallo for me and that I have seen better since but judging by the varied comments on this film I'm not so sure. Maybe it depends upon what mood you are in as to whether you get into this one. It starts well enough and there are some vigorous kills and decent Ortolani music but then it seems to drift. The leads are not particularly impressive and although we do not get half an hour of plodding police investigation we do get a shot or two too many of them motoring from one crime scene to another. There is an inconsistency too some of the kills are very striking and some barely on camera. The main problem seems to lie at the door of Mr Lenzi who just puts the bits and pieces together without any real sense of pleasure or passion. Things just seem to happen and maybe if you are in the right frame of mind this will be OK but should you be looking for a more involving or stylish presentation you may find yourself dropping off.'".

One of the better features in this entry is the fact that there's some rather fun work to be said here about the manner in which this one springs forth with the main plot line. Going from the idea of a killers' botched attempt on the heroine and then turning into the fight to uncover the identity as he continues his rampage gives this a solid base to work with and the film's really at its best when it uses this set up for a series of rather brutal and shocking stalking scenes. The opening double murder strikes where he takes out the woman lying in her bed as well as a later sequence with a hookers' ambush in the tall grass after being picked up by the killer start this off on a solid note while the later scenes here are quite fun as well. There's a visuallyarresting setpiece on an artist in her home where she discovers that poisoned milk intended for her has instead killed her pet cats first before the killer strikes for real and in the ensuing aftermath the shot of red and black paint dripping onto the corpse creates a fantastically beautiful image the big attack on a train where she manages to escape the encounter alive makes for a thrilling actionpacked sequence and the big stalking of the victim in the hotel room where she gets dragged away and placed in the bathtub is a stellar sequence that gives this a great traditional Giallo sequence of the murder victim being placed in the bathtub by drowning. There are more brutal and shocking deaths placed throughout here and these overall give this one a rather strong framework that compares incredibly favorably to the modern gialli taking place at the time with the increasingly strong attack scenes.That carries over into the fine finale which has so much to like here with the big battle with the killer and the final revelation of their motives which ties the whole thing together as well as gives this a rather strong and enjoyable finish for an overall enjoyable Giallo. There's not a whole lot to dislike here which mainly consists of the expected storyline motivation for the killer. It's way too hard to believe that this incident would've sprung anyone into such a rampage much less the one engaged in here and the roundabout way this goes trying to convince that the trauma inflicted forces this kind of reaction as the connections are tenuous at best and sloppily executed at their worst with the film grinding to a halt in the middle segment following the investigation as a montage of him wandering through the city looking for answers.

	schema:headline " Probably the most beautiful Giallo in the world";
	schema:reviewBody "One thing that many Giallos suffer from is low quality production values which doesn't bother me too much  but it can give them a very unprofessional feel which accounts for a lot of the reason why many Giallo haven't received the praise that they rightly deserve. That certainly can't be said for this one however as Seven BloodStained Orchids is as beautiful and professionally made as Giallo comes! The sets are lavishly captured and the way that their colours soak the screen gives the film a potent aesthetic edge. The music bodes well with director Umberto Lenzi's camerawork and also somewhat strangely for Giallo the plot isn't too convoluted and while its not very intricate  it moves well and everything makes sense! The plot follows the murders of two young girls. These are seemingly unconnected except for the fact that both girls have a piece of jewellery in the shape of a half moon on them when they died. After the attempted but not successful murder of another woman her and her husband team up to catch the killer before he can kill another four women that they believe are on his 'hit list'.One common aspect of the Giallo that Seven BloodStained Orchids hasn't managed to get over is the terrible dubbing and trite script. Don't get me wrong neither are terrible examples  but they could make this hard viewing for people that haven't seen much of the subgenre. It hardly matters though because the rest of the film is more than ample to mask these small complaints. The acting is surprisingly good with an experienced cast of Italian film actors doing well at portraying their respective characters. Umberto Lenzi more famous for splatter flicks such as Nightmare City and Cannibal Ferox has kept the gore surprisingly restrained for this film with only one sequence involving a drill springing to mind for anything like splatter. This is never a problem however as the murder sequences on display are brilliantly done and this is a film that doesn't need gore in order to work. The mystery is well plotted and definitely catches the 'thriller' feel  but it disappointed me slightly as no red herrings were thrown in meaning the audience is left to unravel the film WITH the central characters rather than being able to take a stab themselves. Still even that hardly matters  and Seven BloodStained Orchids is easily one of the best Giallos ever made.".

This is never a problem however as the murder sequences on display are brilliantly done and this is a film that doesn't need gore in order to work. The mystery is well plotted and definitely catches the 'thriller' feel  but it disappointed me slightly as no red herrings were thrown in meaning the audience is left to unravel the film WITH the central characters rather than being able to take a stab themselves. Still even that hardly matters  and Seven BloodStained Orchids is easily one of the best Giallos ever made.";

This was the first Umberto Lenzi film I saw that was actually really good and showed a lot more style than his trashy  gory outings from the 80's. I was initially to give this movie 810 but I had to subtract one point because I guessed who the killer was before the final scenes. And that's a bit too bad because this is a really good giallo with a solid mystery story that makes sense. The good thing was that I only knew who the killer should turn out to be and not what his relation was to the events and the characters. So there are enough interesting things happening and plot elements to keep you going. The music was simply groovy as hell. I would love to own that soundtrack . In recent years I've caught up with quite some giallo films and Sette Orchidee Macchiate Di Rosso sure remains a winner! The odds are even very likely that when I rewatch this baby I just might chip in an extra point again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although this was director Lenzi's fifth virtually successive entry in the Giallo subgenre as the title itself indicates it was his first real 'body count' effort it also turned out to be the last film produced by German company Rialto noted for making Krimis which for all intents and purposes featured many traits of the later and more violent Italian Gialli. Composer Riz Ortolani's typically cool lounge tune over the opening credits is virtually the whole score here since variations of it are played throughout the film and in hindsight emerges as easily the most memorable thing about this average thriller incidentally I knew I had heard the song featured towards the midpoint of the film somewhere before and as it turned out it was lifted from an earlier genre effort by the same director  SO SWEETSO PERVERSE 1969! While even the casting here is somewhat subpar with bland leading man Antonio Sabato and underused Rossella Falk and Marisa Mell albeit in an unconvincing dual role most of the girl victims including Uschi Glas Marina Malfatti Gabriella Giorgelli are certainly attractive as per the standard formula requirements but atypically none ever get truly naked. The rest of the male cast is made up of Pier Paolo Capponi as the investigating Inspector Claudio Gora as an enigmatic cluedropping stranger and ubiquitous character actor Nello Pazzafini as the obligatory brutish but ultimately innocent suspect grilled by the Police. Needless to say the presence of the equally mandatory gloved killer makes itself felt right from the very first scene but funnily enough here he is also made to dispose of his first victim's elderly mother or concierge asleep in the next room!Although the motive for the murders is the triedandtested one of revenge for the death of a relative the way the serial killer obtains his list of potential victims a page of a signingin book at a hotel they had all worked at during the previous year is farfetched. The half moon talisman left by the killer as his signature on the scene of the crime coincidentally ties the film to the unrelated Hollywood fantasy flick THE MAN IN HALF MOON STREET 1944 that I have just watched as part of this ongoing Halloween Challenge and indeed the film was even released under the alternate title of PUZZLE OF THE SILVER HALF MOONS in some territories! Par for the course is the investigation independently initiated by fashion designer Sabato soon after his 'fresh' bride Glas is assaulted on the train taking them to their honeymoon destination somewhat foolishly the film makes use of the same ruse of purposefully misinforming the murderer firstly of the success of his latest attack Glas eventually goes into hiding and later of Sabato's arrest thus giving him free rein to conduct his attempts at amateur detection. Ultimately a Giallo is only as good as its group of assorted potential suspects and in this case there are only three an American migr leading a hedonistic lifestyle in a hippielike commune nervous socialite Mell who also gets the film's premiere murder setpiece via a driller to the chest  but unluckily for the killer it is her lookalike 'innocent' twin who gets it! and a mousey priest.Once the lifeless body of the blond Yank is found hanged the priestkiller reveal is rendered predictable also because we keep going back to him for no evident reason and links it with DON'T TORTURE A DUCKILING 1972 but his drowning comeuppance is pretty weak and anticlimactic  especially compared to the visceral one suffered by the childkilling clergyman in the latter Lucio Fulci film! Unfortunately unlike the positive comments I had expressed regarding the English dubbing of Riccardo Freda's THE IGUANA WITH THE TONGUE OF FIRE 1971 the one present here is mediocre at best.".

But Mora in detained by his hoodlums  being mistreated  beaten and wounded . However thugs working for Leprince began to be murdered one by one as well. Then  the chief Inspector Antonio Prieto suspects Miguel can be the killer .This averagebudget film contains thrills  a noir intrigue and lots of murders . It's a passable thriller directed by prolific filmmaker Jess Frank and also produced by his own production company Manacoa Films along with Albatros SA . Here Franco manages to give us an adequate ambient  an evocative production design by Teddy Villalba  being rightly narrated  including a criminal plot enough to keep you intrigued throughout the flick . Based on the novel Vous Souvenezvous de Paco? written by Charles Exbrayat and well adapted by the same Jesus Franco . The picture was well starred by one of the best Spanish actors  Fernando Fernan Gomez who formerly had directed to Jesus Franco in Extrao Viaje . Furthermore  two French players who previously worked in the successful Rififi  Jean Servais and Robert Manuel . The Spanish support cast is frankly good  as Agustin Gonzalez  Manuel Gas  Sergio Mendizabal  Antonio Prieto  Luis Marin  Antonio Jimenez Escribano  among others .

But Mora in detained by his hoodlums  being mistreated  beaten and wounded . However thugs working for Leprince began to be murdered one by one as well. Then  the chief Inspector Antonio Prieto suspects Miguel can be the killer .This averagebudget film contains thrills  a noir intrigue and lots of murders . It's a passable thriller directed by prolific filmmaker Jess Frank and also produced by his own production company Manacoa Films along with Albatros SA . Here Franco manages to give us an adequate ambient  an evocative production design by Teddy Villalba  being rightly narrated  including a criminal plot enough to keep you intrigued throughout the flick . Based on the novel Vous Souvenezvous de Paco? written by Charles Exbrayat and well adapted by the same Jesus Franco . The picture was well starred by one of the best Spanish actors  Fernando Fernan Gomez who formerly had directed to Jesus Franco in Extrao Viaje . Furthermore  two French players who previously worked in the successful Rififi  Jean Servais and Robert Manuel . The Spanish support cast is frankly good  as Agustin Gonzalez  Manuel Gas  Sergio Mendizabal  Antonio Prieto  Luis Marin  Antonio Jimenez Escribano  among others .

	schema:reviewBody "Those who know Jess Franco's work only by his later graphic films might be surprised by Rififi in the City a solid filmnoir. The book Immoral Tales compared Rififi in the City to The Lady from Shanghai but there is only one scene a clandestine meeting at an aquarium that is a direct homage to the Welles film. A more fitting comparison would be Fritz Lang's The Big Heat. Franco is a film fan so in addition to the Welles and Lang references the director sprinkles homages to The 39 Steps Kiss of Death and probably other classic films as well. These add to the viewing fun of Rififi in the City without taking away from the its grim tone. The plot has Detective Miguel Mora obsessively chasing after politician Maurice Leprince a well connected official who is responsible for most of the vice in the unnamed city. Leprince an exNazi seldom gets his hands dirty leaving that to his bodyguards and a shady nightclub manager Puig. As the film opens Detective Mora might have his man. Juan an informer has the proof. Then Juan disappears and Mora begins needling Leprince to return the missing man. After Juan's dead body is thrown into Mora's house the detective becomes even more determined to nail the politician. Mora is not alone. Someone else is avenging Juan murdering Leprince's bodyguards one at a time. Rififi in the City works as a filmnoir. It features a good hero and villain. The ending is surprisingly downbeat. Even the mystery angle works better than expected. There are stumbles. Franco is not good at directing action scenes. Thus the police raid on the nightclub at the climax of the film which should be the film's set piece comes across as haphazard and a missed opportunity. Still Rififi in the City stands as one of the director's best made films. It might be too much of a standard film for some of the Franco fanatics but it is a good one to show those who think of Franco as only a hack director of sex films.".

The story line reminded me more of Dashiell Hammett's The Glass Key The Servais character is a gangster and night club owner who also runs for senator. The political campaign takes up quite some time with a huge mass of Servais posters in the streets a propaganda march in a public space a full fledged political speech and Servais kissing an old woman and later complaining to his aides that she smelled of onions. A police informer and ladies man close to the Servais character was killed he is not deposited on the steps of a police station but thrown through the window into a police man's private residence  which might give an idea of the degree of violence dealt out here and it is basically about the search of the killer and a succession of further killings to avenge that death. The negative nature of politics in general takes quite a lot of space which always surprises me a little in movies that were apparently made in Spain during the Franco regime. Besides Servais there are a lot of really picturesque character actors of both sexes on display.".

It seems he took greater pains with his early work because this 1963 noir which isn't even listed among his films in Jean Tulard's Dictionnaire du Cinema is excellent. I'm grateful to the eversplendid Movie Detective for the chance to see it on DVD.Fernand Fernan Gomez plays Miguel Mora a Central American cop obsessed with bringing down Leprince Jean Servais who arrived in the country in 1944 so you can guess what he did in the war. Mora's informer Juan is killed and when Mora goes to the nightcub Leprince owns and accuses him Leprince's three thugs beat Mora savagely and throw him into the sea. He survives and then someone starts killing the thugs.Mora's boss played by an actor with the worst skin you ever saw initially suspects Mora a bit daft since Mora is still hobbling badly and couldn't have chased the thug down a pier and stabbed him. We know the killer is a woman avenging Juan's death and there's a clue to her identity early on.The film has flaws. Too many musical and dance scenes in the nightclub which seem like padding and the police raid on the nightclub is unconvincing it was a surprise raid so how come the waiters all seemed to have guns? These. though are minor quibbles. Franco was clearly talented and this is a rare treat. I can't recall seeing another Spanish noir.BTW the following year the roles were reversed and Fernan Gomez directed Franco in A Strange Journey one of the most brilliant Spanish films I've seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "I do not know the background of this film but it has features that later Jess Franco's films had beautiful girls young readers will be appalled by their large hairdos but yes women were using it like that and I liked it plenty of bad guys coward and courageous cops rotten politicians a South American unnamed country sunny and reach in opportunities for working people and cocaine traffickers. Other reviewers noticed how Franco's next films were a succession of cheap exploitative slashers nudity prostitution gore terror. Why? My answer is that maybe Franco thought as time went by that he needed money and he was more serious than his audiences and distributors. If he saw historical evolution right after 1963 he understood that he made a film with a happy end no it's not a spoiler yet that was out of pace with real life we know now for certain that gangsters former Nazis people involved in drugs trafficking when democratic elections by using power fear and all the votes money can buy. In a far unnamed country in Latin America  nothing to affect English speakers... Franco did manage to film this in Madrid under a dictatorial regime but his film was so good too good in fact that it has had almost no distribution even with VHS and DVD. Or else I've been distracted and many fans of Franco too.And yet Franco was placing all in front of our eyes. The first image is a political campaign poster Leprince es Justicia Leprince is Justice but we FORGET it when the woman's voice starts speaking low of a gone lover and the camera pans onto the beach house and the seashore. The orchestra that starts playing all that black jazz score by Jess Franco as Daniel J. White  also the wonderful cabaret numbers though the film and an elegant pair of ankles and feet are doing dance steps on the chalk marks on the stage 1234... and on and on but we FORGET that it means that her audience us do not care she is not what she pretends to be a dancer and as credits roll we finally see her the buxom blonde in a tight white dress promising us kisses. A couple of black men are seen dating with brunettes and one even has time to evade answering her about sort of thing was he dealing with  to be so rich and to afford having a different girl every night and promising them pricey cars but we FORGET about him as he is a mere underling to the big boss and soon dispatched from the story. The cabaret owner is also the owner of the cotton industries and an immigrant of April 1944 arriving without money from Nazi occupied Marseilles France but we FORGET that Franco plants this information in three distant occupied dialogs never as a relevant matter but something that blurts out in the middle of something else. One person will come close to another person who is snoring loud after drinking an alcohol drink open the person's shirt extract a small key to a safe and eventually finding out more than expected yeah! I managed to write this without a spoiler! and we FORGET that neither Orson Welles nor Alfred Hitchock ever managed such a long thrilling suspense that had me on the edge of the chair and yet unable to press fast forward  for I was as much afraid of that said person.The expression Rififi comes from the underground world of Brussels I think and it's almost impossible to translate so in other languages as in Spanish it is either left alone or a different approach must be used... Riffraff is not an explanation and it is more than struggle or fight because it conveys despair allout annihilation...The French title Vous souvenezvous de Paco? do you remember Paco the most common short name in Spanish language countries... is very intriguing. With it Franco tells us that Paco will be easily forgotten by the men in the story and in the audience who will NEVER FORGET the French or is it German? that fled to South America to start a new life or is it?. I with my male brain already forgot Paco's face but Franco also told me that Paco will never be forgotten by the women who loved him for his face his body his sex or himself? even if he had not loved them. Nina's and Pilar's speeches on camera or in a letter read later by a police detective mark the difference between man and woman in a relationship  and suddenly I find that this is not just an engag director settling a political matter it is a genial director putting us facetoface with the ages old question of love sex and relationships. In 1963  five years before the summer of 1968.The beautiful cinematography in black and white and the cheap decors somewhat manages to give to the film all the bright colors  and shades  of Latin America but the original story or its magnificent screen adaptation leads us to the high levels of human and social statements film directors ever made in a movie.I'm ashamed I only knew Jesus Franco by some musical scores in sexploitation films and a couple of Doctor Orloffs. I paid US8.37 for the original version in Spanish no subtitles Clsicos Imprescindibles del Cine Espaol at a discount sale that runs exactly 99 min 30 sec. format 1.851 screen 43 an excellent blameless print by Mercury Films  Video and Filmfax Homevideo. I'm not selling it for US83.70 even if you ask politely. Unless you've just won a democratic election in your State  like in this film's there is a decider second vote after the first results are counted  and you and your friends make me an offer THAT I CAN'T POSSIBLY REFUSE. pun intended".

My answer is that maybe Franco thought as time went by that he needed money and he was more serious than his audiences and distributors. If he saw historical evolution right after 1963 he understood that he made a film with a happy end no it's not a spoiler yet that was out of pace with real life we know now for certain that gangsters former Nazis people involved in drugs trafficking when democratic elections by using power fear and all the votes money can buy. In a far unnamed country in Latin America  nothing to affect English speakers... Franco did manage to film this in Madrid under a dictatorial regime but his film was so good too good in fact that it has had almost no distribution even with VHS and DVD. Or else I've been distracted and many fans of Franco too.And yet Franco was placing all in front of our eyes. The first image is a political campaign poster Leprince es Justicia Leprince is Justice but we FORGET it when the woman's voice starts speaking low of a gone lover and the camera pans onto the beach house and the seashore. The orchestra that starts playing all that black jazz score by Jess Franco as Daniel J. White  also the wonderful cabaret numbers though the film and an elegant pair of ankles and feet are doing dance steps on the chalk marks on the stage 1234... and on and on but we FORGET that it means that her audience us do not care she is not what she pretends to be a dancer and as credits roll we finally see her the buxom blonde in a tight white dress promising us kisses. A couple of black men are seen dating with brunettes and one even has time to evade answering her about sort of thing was he dealing with  to be so rich and to afford having a different girl every night and promising them pricey cars but we FORGET about him as he is a mere underling to the big boss and soon dispatched from the story. The cabaret owner is also the owner of the cotton industries and an immigrant of April 1944 arriving without money from Nazi occupied Marseilles France but we FORGET that Franco plants this information in three distant occupied dialogs never as a relevant matter but something that blurts out in the middle of something else. One person will come close to another person who is snoring loud after drinking an alcohol drink open the person's shirt extract a small key to a safe and eventually finding out more than expected yeah! I managed to write this without a spoiler! and we FORGET that neither Orson Welles nor Alfred Hitchock ever managed such a long thrilling suspense that had me on the edge of the chair and yet unable to press fast forward  for I was as much afraid of that said person.The expression Rififi comes from the underground world of Brussels I think and it's almost impossible to translate so in other languages as in Spanish it is either left alone or a different approach must be used... Riffraff is not an explanation and it is more than struggle or fight because it conveys despair allout annihilation...The French title Vous souvenezvous de Paco? do you remember Paco the most common short name in Spanish language countries... is very intriguing. With it Franco tells us that Paco will be easily forgotten by the men in the story and in the audience who will NEVER FORGET the French or is it German? that fled to South America to start a new life or is it?. I with my male brain already forgot Paco's face but Franco also told me that Paco will never be forgotten by the women who loved him for his face his body his sex or himself? even if he had not loved them. Nina's and Pilar's speeches on camera or in a letter read later by a police detective mark the difference between man and woman in a relationship  and suddenly I find that this is not just an engag director settling a political matter it is a genial director putting us facetoface with the ages old question of love sex and relationships. In 1963  five years before the summer of 1968.The beautiful cinematography in black and white and the cheap decors somewhat manages to give to the film all the bright colors  and shades  of Latin America but the original story or its magnificent screen adaptation leads us to the high levels of human and social statements film directors ever made in a movie.I'm ashamed I only knew Jesus Franco by some musical scores in sexploitation films and a couple of Doctor Orloffs. I paid US8.37 for the original version in Spanish no subtitles Clsicos Imprescindibles del Cine Espaol at a discount sale that runs exactly 99 min 30 sec. format 1.851 screen 43 an excellent blameless print by Mercury Films  Video and Filmfax Homevideo. I'm not selling it for US83.70 even if you ask politely. Unless you've just won a democratic election in your State  like in this film's there is a decider second vote after the first results are counted  and you and your friends make me an offer THAT I CAN'T POSSIBLY REFUSE. pun intended";

Frau Elena is also interested in the amorous creature and Herr Mariotti's gambling debts are also part of the plot.Il Fauno 1917 is a very odd silent film even for a German count who has watched a lot of strange silents since the cinema were invented. Italian film directors of that time had a strong interest in the Arts and that is demonstrated in a rather eccentric way in Il Fauno a peculiar mixture of the fantastique and romanticism.The film is introduced by the director Herr Febo Mari himself who also plays the faun in the film in a theatrical way with a kind of preface wherein the director explains his artistic aims to the audience before the curtain is up. The director thus sets forth his intentions which include a great deal of symbolism the various characters representing different virtues or weaknesses. Theatrical it may be but it is also very cinematic and uses techniques that were new in the 10's of the last century.Herr Mari uses the fantastic and mythological elements together with symbolism and philosophy in a very clever and entertaining way sometimes naf certainly but not at all pedantic. Il Fauno is also an interesting portrait of the decadent Italian bourgeoisie who were not very different from their other European counterparts. Obviously the most bizarre and original part of the film is the fantastic one when the satire comes to life and enthralled Herr Mariotti's model. It is certainly a strange love affair but at its heart not so different from a fully human love encounter because as the faun explains to the young girl every man has a heart like a faun. The film has a mystical oneiric atmosphere that combines the real and the unreal and modernity with classicism. What makes the film even more enjoyable is that it has recently been restored complete with the original tints that highlight Herr Febo Mari's artistic intentionsAnd now if you'll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because one of his fat Teutonic heiresses is getting this German Count's goat.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film at the Venice Film Festival and have waited a long time to comment on it as I wanted to see it again when I was released. However it still has not come out and I don't know if it ever will.Alec Baldwin is a writer down on his luck and nowhere to go but down even further.As with many viewers I suspect I was attracted to this film by the cast and the fact that it has received so much press good and bad. The plot is based on the old casino idea of a writer whose career in next to nil and is getting ready to self destruct  and unless you get into it it'll feel rather forced and silly at times.However the film helped me to overcome this by being very low key and downbeat  very much like Baldwin himself. The film is not a great thing but one that is easy to get into. The film uses Las Vegas really well but it is a classic story that is fun to believe in. It is much better than the fun breezy and slick fantasies that we are sold in other films. The mix of romance comedy and violence works very well  at points it was very touching at others quite funny.It isn't perfect of course and the writing is where the problems lie the story did rely on the audience buying into it and at times the dialogue comes very close to corn but just misses. The only time I felt really let down was the ending which although fitting with the spirit of the film missed a great chance to be fun exciting and original all at the same time.Still a good film and definitely worth the watching.".

BUT in spite of Baldwin's ineptness it actually turned out to be a very good film. I would go see it again and I would take my family to see it if they edited out the bedroom scene. BOTTOM LINE It's a wonderful and classic story with a wonderful cast and somehow this film has been able to overcome all of the obstacles that stood in its way.

Dan Akroyd really showed off his dramatic talents.Of all the actors in the film the one I had to rank the lowest was Baldwin. He really had no business acting or directing this film. His performance left a lot to be desired and his directing even more so. I found out later that he walked off the set after he turned in his Director's cut and they hired a new editor who literally saved this film the dying a slow death.I read in the trades where Producers Michael Gordon and David Glasser were the ones who kept trying to keep this film from sitting on a shelf for the next twenty years and finally got Bob Yari to acquire the film from the insurance company.

Anthony Hopkins doesn't seem to know what he is doing in the film. He ends up giving a long monologue towards the end. If the film had bright sparks during that scene I missed it as I was sleeping on my seat. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt resembles a Devil. She wears illfitting trite clothes and scowls at random kids. As for Alec Baldwin a scene where he goes to meet Webster for the first time is not to be missed. What a waste of money! As Anthony Hopkins rightly put it Go back home and write better!".

	schema:reviewBody "As a teacher of fifty years experience in language and cinematic artsI taught The Devil and Dan'l Webster as part of the fictional pantheon of American Literature. Although Alec Baldwin certainly has burned some bridges along the way in his career this film takes creative risks many of them worthy of consideration which exemplify a significant part of Americana. Like its forbear the 1941 cinematic adaptation starring Walter Huston this version was attacked condemned and dismissed when it was released. I believe that every adaptation of any book is an aesthetic fossil caught in cinematic amber.The movie substantiates the same sort of meretricious value system in its depiction of Jabez Stone that struck Stephen Vincent Benet and the makers of the 1941 gem. In its lampooning of pretentious high society panderers of cheesy albeit popular writing casting them as bestsellers Shortcut to Happinessdramatizes a contemporary examination of what actually constitutes success in the dizzying world of publications.Anthony Hopkins was well cast in the role of Daniel Webster. It is instructive to compare and contrast Edward Arnold's portrayal of Webster in the 1941 classic with that of Hopkins because both actors have earned a lifetime of accolades portraying both admirable and despicable characters. Hopkins and Arnold remain symbols of financial and thespian success.Hollywood has a bad record for disapproving of movies solely on the basis of profit. I would love to see Shortcut to Happiness go into postproduction be subjected to a diverse array of test audiences after a skillful rewrite. The issues that concerned Stephen Vincent Benet in 1937 are alive and with us all today in almost every area of business politics entertainment and government. Success is whatever you can get away with.Audiences will go to see bad movies. But Hollywood only seems to take the loving and meticulouslyartistic care to produce two or three cinematic gems each year. Whoever had the final say in terms of condemning this movie wasted time money and the potential for achieving what its creators had in mind when the idea was but an inspiration culled from reading the classic and wishing to update it.If one of my students had submitted this movie script to me I would have said Promising rough draft and suggest various ways to improve it with my reasons for doing so.".

I still think Alec Baldwin was maybe not right as Jabez Stone. He has some good moments but I think he has to many moments where he is trying to act is ass off and making it look obvious. Is it me or in some scenes where Baldwin is talking he sounds kind of goofy and over the top. Just a thought.Anthony Hopkins was perfect as Daniel Webster but again isn't he always? Whatever shortfalls his film has Hopkins makes up for it in his charm and charisma which he tackles head on easily throughout the movie.The best acting we get here is from Dan Akroyd and Jennifer Love but especially Hewitt which is no surprise to me considering how well she has done in some of her previous films. The story doesn't really kick off till the very end where everything unfolds very fast to an entertaining climax which without this film would have failed badly. I don't know much about producer Michael Z. Gordon's previous work except with the good film Narc but I am impressed with how he handled this film.".

Everyone in it Kim Catrall Hopkins Rubin Akroyd and even Baldwin himself are quite wonderful but Ms. Hewitt throws the balance. She's the thing that spoils the movie especially her delivery of the last closing argument monologue belongs in some kind of first year acting class. The movie is a bit moralistic and sentimental and in my opinion it does not live up to the actual story of The Devil and Daniel Webster which is in many ways more subtle than how Baldwin had handled it. He's gone for a more commercial treatment of a concept whose sophistication could have been just as entertaining. All in all it's a fun little piece thought some of the sets the editing as well as the casting of Hewitt should have been rethought. Baldwin is a decent enough director keeps the film moving and definitely gives the characters good arcs.".

They made some changes to the story that don't make much sense to me. Daniel Webster in the story was a famous lawyer from New Hampshire in the story. In the movie he is an editor. A lawyer makes more sense since he ends up representing Jabez Stone against the devil himherself he was a man in the story but was a woman in the movie in a trial where both of their souls are on the line. As an editor it doesn't seem likely that Daniel Webster would have the skill to do this.The acting was decent by all except for Alec Baldwin and Dan Aykroyd. These are two actors that I like they just did an awful job in this movie. It was as though they thought they were acting in a comedy but the movie was more a serious one than a comedy. This might be partly due to the fact that the movie was filmed with a particular vision in mind and was then reedited by somebody else. Given this fact it's surprising that it was at all coherent. I was surprised to see a fair amount of SNL cast members in the movie which further leads me to believe it may have originally been filmed with the intention of it being more of a comedy.All in all I would have to say it wasn't completely awful but it wasn't much good. If I could get the hour and a half back and do something else with it I would. The ending was especially disappointing. As in the original story Daniel Webster defeats the devil in the trial. Jabez then starts out again at the beginning of the movie...literally we are just brought back to the first scene with Jabez and then the movie abruptly ends. It actually looked as though they just replayed Jabez' first scene over and called it the end. There is no indication that Jabez has the benefit of any of the knowledge or experience he gained so who is to say he didn't just repeat his mistakes over again and perhaps over and over in an endless loop? It was an extremely disappointing end and did not make a lot of sense. The decent cast and the acting of everyone except for Baldwin and Aykroyd are the only things that keep this from being a complete and total crap sandwich.".

I too saw the original version and it did leave a lot to be desired. However there were two more versions one after Baldwin abandoned ship and the last one just before it was sold to Bob Yari. I can definitely say that the final cut  which is the one that's coming out next year  is by far the best!!! The latest version is a half hour shorter and a great editing job by whoever did the work. Anothony Hopkins was called in to do some extra voiceovers and the end result is that this film really rocks!! There's a great song that was written by one of the producers of the film Michael Gordon which I hope they use for the opening song. You can listen to the song and see lots of stuff about this film at mowefilms.com.This is a classic story which won an Academy Award back in the 40's and I think it's got a shot at Best Song or Best Screenplay if it comes out in the theaters at the right time. Anyway see the film and judge for yourself. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.".

Anothony Hopkins was called in to do some extra voiceovers and the end result is that this film really rocks!! There's a great song that was written by one of the producers of the film Michael Gordon which I hope they use for the opening song. You can listen to the song and see lots of stuff about this film at mowefilms.com.This is a classic story which won an Academy Award back in the 40's and I think it's got a shot at Best Song or Best Screenplay if it comes out in the theaters at the right time. Anyway see the film and judge for yourself. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.";

Obviously The Devil and Daniel Webster based on short story by Stephen Vincent Benet and directed  starred by Alec Baldwin is another Faust that asks and answers that yet done so poorly.Defending this movie is a lost cause. It seemed like a long episode of Amazing Stories and without the wit of that show too. Baldwin did direct it lifelessly and tastelessly. The important situations were done nonimportantly The agreement's scene for little instance. For one so unfortunate time I witnessed Anthony Hopkins acting badly OH MY GOD the great man was doing his job indifferently like it's a cold rehearsal all along. You have to suspect or be sure that this is an outcome for the no efforts of the man behind the camera this round. Baldwin must have been shy to direct the Hopkins himself!Jennifer Love Hewitt was unbelievably miscast to historical extent. I mean WHY???!!!!! If the devil is that awful then fighting it would be so easy job! The moment of her saying When was the last time you woke up on the bed with a girl like me?! is whether a hint about Baldwin as a virgin or it is one of the most comic moments ever I know that I laughed a lot after it!.Yes there are some smart points like transforming the contract into sex. But the death of the friend the second friend was a bit fabricated or just too metaphoric the end of the true writer inside the lead?. Then the stroke. The major pain. The basic nonsense. And I do mean the climactic sequence. While being the movie's highest point at all it has the poorest acting directing and writing. Surely the speech of Hopkins's character didn't persuade me even for a second the devil's one was stronger and truer. As you see this movie doesn't know how to save its lead or itself!As I read after filming was completed in 2001 the movie has been shelved for nearly 6 years due to the lack of funds. And after coming into the possession of Bob Yari Productions it was extensively reedited to not bear any resemblance to its original form or to Benet's story. Therefore Baldwin has since requested that his name be removed from the credits as a director and producer. According to what I watched I couldn't agree more! So whatever it's Baldwin's Bob Yari Productions' or even the devil's fault the weak effect that Shortcut to Happiness achieved especially after so pale and unexplained finale does make you remember it  at best  as not bad movie. There weren't enough elements to eventually call it good. Simply good intentions can't make a good movie alone.".

Of course that made me want to see it but I couldn't find it anywhere until I came across it by accident on Amazon Prime Video. Well does the movie show telltale signs of behind the scenes troubles and is it a really bad movie? Yes and yes. There are many things wrong with this movie such as the flat or downright awful performances by the cast the fact that it's obvious that linking footage or entire scenes are missing the pacing is extremely slow and the fact that telling this classic story in a modern setting brings no new perspective or angles. However what really bothered me most about the movie was that the movie never finds a clear tone and sticks with it. As it is the movie is too goofy to be taken seriously but somehow also too serious to make the comic touches amusing. The results are that I was not quite sure how to take this story.... apart from it being done in a really bad manner. While I'll admit some of the blame for the movie's failure doesn't fall on directoractor Alec Baldwin's shoulders  he claimed that the movie was taken out of his hands and butchered by others  there are no real signs that his intended version would have been that much better. In short the movie is a really strange change of genre for prolific schlockmeister producers Randall Emmett and George Furla. But not strange enough to really catch the interest of the select few who sometimes get a kick out of big budget cinematic misfires.".

	schema:headline " Better Than Usual Sequel";
	schema:reviewBody "The Stepfather was a surprisingly classy thriller stuck at the end of the 80's slasher glut. Thanks to a smart script and a phenomenal performance from Terry O'Quinn The Stepfather ended up becoming a cult classic.Even though it seemed as if O'Quinn's Jerry Blake was killed off at the end of the first film the magic of the movies brings him back for yet another round of slashings in the sake of the American Dream. Jerry's now stuck in a mental hospital. He of course escapes and forms a new identity  this time a psychiatristnamed Gene specializing in suburban women which gives him a nice group of gals to choose from for his next dream wife.Unfortunately for Carol the beautiful Meg Foster Jerry fixates on her and her son Jonathan Brandis and wants them to become his new family. Jerry's soon up to his own tricks dispatching of anyone that gets in his way.This is a movie that doesn't need to exist so it's to director Jeff Burr's credit that he's able to make it seem as if this movie has a right for being here.

	onyx:emotionText "The Stepfather was a surprisingly classy thriller stuck at the end of the 80's slasher glut. Thanks to a smart script and a phenomenal performance from Terry O'Quinn The Stepfather ended up becoming a cult classic.Even though it seemed as if O'Quinn's Jerry Blake was killed off at the end of the first film the magic of the movies brings him back for yet another round of slashings in the sake of the American Dream. Jerry's now stuck in a mental hospital. He of course escapes and forms a new identity  this time a psychiatristnamed Gene specializing in suburban women which gives him a nice group of gals to choose from for his next dream wife.Unfortunately for Carol the beautiful Meg Foster Jerry fixates on her and her son Jonathan Brandis and wants them to become his new family. Jerry's soon up to his own tricks dispatching of anyone that gets in his way.This is a movie that doesn't need to exist so it's to director Jeff Burr's credit that he's able to make it seem as if this movie has a right for being here. Bringing Terry O'Quinn back is a huge plus and he's pitch perfect here. Joining him are genre faves Meg Foster and Caroline Williams who are equally game and ground a rather ridiculous story in reality. There's a nice dose of playful dark humor throughout and the murder set pieces will please gore fiends without turning off those in the mood for more traditional thriller stylings.Stepfather II might not reinvent the genre but it's a worthy and fun sequel.";

Rarely does a film score stick in my head but this one does. And then there's Terry O'Quinn who plays the character just right.You have to remember that this film was basically made in only 4 months. That's writing the script casting shooting post production etc. It was made for about 1 and a half million dollars and originally was supposed to be a direct to video release. Some additional shots were added and changed when the studio decided it was going to run a theatrical release like the first Stepfather and they needed a more violent Horror Movie.The new DVD release presents the film in it's original Widescreen format and it's a very sharp Animorphic transfer. A great thing included on the disc is that it has many alternate and extended scenes that were from the original Director's cut. There is also a short still gallery and a very interesting fulllength commentary by the Director and Producer of Stepfather 2. The only thing missing is a theatrical trailer...albeit most Buena Vista DVD's lack a trailer so it's no big surprise there.If you like this film then you need this DVD it easily blows away the old VHS and Laserdisc editions. Now if only they'd release the 1st Stepfather movie on DVD!!!".

It Did face production constraints but it's too similar to the original Film but the ending was interesting the wedding scene is definitely a Stand out and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.All in all a decent follow up not quite on the level of the first one but overall a decent follow up could have been a lot worse.".

We pick up shortly after the original film and see that the man formerly known as Jerry Blake is inside of a psychiatric facility serving his sentence for all the murders and attempts he committed. He breaks out early on and changes his persona yet again to a psychiatrist named Gene this time targeting single mother Carol and her teenage son Todd. After brutally dispatching people in the way of him building a life with them Gene makes it to the church on his wedding day ... but will he get through the ceremony without losing his mind completely?Terry Quinn I thought 'Stepfather II' was really interesting in the sense that it separated itself from the other two films. In parts one and three the stepchildren Stephanie in 1 and Andy in 3 disliked the stepfather a lot. They could see that something was off with him and it never really clicked. In this sequel the son Todd really liked Gene the stepfather and looked up to him as a role model of sorts. His father just up and left him and his mom so the writers did a great job of establishing Todd's need for a male figure. It kind of makes it all the more sad when it's revealed how sick Gene really is.Terry Quinn puts in an amazing performance yet again as the deranged man who would kill for a perfect family unit. Meg Foster did really well as the mother Carol as did Jonathan Brandis as Todd. I liked the friend Maddie that they gave Carol played by Caroline Williams. She was really good too. It lacked the intensity of the original film but 'Stepfather II' is still very well done. The finale at the church as Gene prepares for his wedding is also very creepy.. and perhaps very bloody. I recommend this one!710".

Meg Foster did really well as the mother Carol as did Jonathan Brandis as Todd. I liked the friend Maddie that they gave Carol played by Caroline Williams. She was really good too. It lacked the intensity of the original film but 'Stepfather II' is still very well done. The finale at the church as Gene prepares for his wedding is also very creepy.. and perhaps very bloody. I recommend this one!710";

This sequel picks up from the end of the first film with O'Quinn escaping from an insane asylum assuming a new identify and finding a new family to be a loving stepfather. Jonathan Brandis the son of O'Quinn's new wife Meg Foster begins to suspect something is wrong with his new stepdad and the white picket fences begin to crumble. The main weakness of this sequel is that the original film was told from the perspective of the teen daughter and tension built around her slowly coming to the realization that her new stepfather is not who he says he is. It wasn't a mystery in the original film that O'Quinn was a killer but it was the suspenseful game of catandmouse between stepfather and daughter that made the film interesting as well as O'Quinn's dynamite performance. Where this sequel goes wrong is that O'Quinn is now the main character which jettisons the film's catandmouse suspense and also causes film fall into standard slasher film conventions losing the originality of the first film. O'Quinn is still excellent but overall Stepfather II is a soso horrorslasher film that's nowhere as good as the highly original first film.".

As the therapist to all of the local wives he learns that her husband Phil ran away last year and when he tries to come back to his family our stepfather hero kills him and covers it up.The mail carrier Matty Crimmins Caroline Williams Stretch from Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2! sees through his identity when she finds mail addresses to the real Gene Clifford that reveals him to be a black man. You know what happens to people who figure out the stepfather's identity? Yep. They get removed and their wine gets taken.Those bottles of wine and the song Camptown Races end up fingering Gene with Carol confronting him just before they're due to be married. Despite being stabbed the stepfather almost succeeds in killing again until Todd stabs him with a clawhammer. Then comes the best part in this entire film mother and son walk out to Here Comes the Bride while a choir reacts in abject terror to the fact that they're covered in blood.Oh man  our kinda sorta hero isn't dead yet. He makes his way to the altar before saying Until death do us part. Oh man. Well done dude.After a test screening of the film Harvey and Bob Weinstein complained about the lack of blood and demanded reshoots.

As the therapist to all of the local wives he learns that her husband Phil ran away last year and when he tries to come back to his family our stepfather hero kills him and covers it up.The mail carrier Matty Crimmins Caroline Williams Stretch from Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2! sees through his identity when she finds mail addresses to the real Gene Clifford that reveals him to be a black man. You know what happens to people who figure out the stepfather's identity? Yep. They get removed and their wine gets taken.Those bottles of wine and the song Camptown Races end up fingering Gene with Carol confronting him just before they're due to be married. Despite being stabbed the stepfather almost succeeds in killing again until Todd stabs him with a clawhammer. Then comes the best part in this entire film mother and son walk out to Here Comes the Bride while a choir reacts in abject terror to the fact that they're covered in blood.Oh man  our kinda sorta hero isn't dead yet. He makes his way to the altar before saying Until death do us part. Oh man. Well done dude.After a test screening of the film Harvey and Bob Weinstein complained about the lack of blood and demanded reshoots. Director Jeff Burr The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III Puppet Master 4 Puppet Master 5 The Final Chapter Pumpkinhead II Blood Wings and O'Quinn refused so the shots were added in by another director.Stepfather 2 isn't quite as good as the original. But hey  if you're looking for one more movie where a dad wipes out his family...";

But he would like to try. Maybe if you just spent some time with him you'd grow to appreciate that he is not in any way or form trying to replace his predecessor but that he's always there for you if you need him.With that in mind the lowbudget sequel to the surprise slasherthriller flick The Stepfather is a noticeable yet serviceable stepdown from the original. Director Jeff Burr who would go on to helm other horror sequels like Leatherface The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III and Pumpkinhead II Blood Wings does a pretty decent job of keeping Stepfather II from being too much of a stepdown in quality. While the suspense from the original is all but gone the film moves at a nice pace that compliments its somewhat contrived feeling. You might not be surprised or shocked while watching the film but you'll never find yourself counting the minutes until it's over either.It helps that the film boasts a solid cast. Leading the pack is the indispensable Terry O'Quinn returning to the titular role. O'Quinn is given many an opportunity to expand on the character and have a little fun with it and boy does he. One line in particular  the disgusted I even had sex with you for God's sake!  hinges completely on his deadpan delivery and his commitment to the character. Meg Foster plays his wouldbe wife and as with anything she's appeared in she's a pleasure to watch and classes up the whole affair in the process. A young Jonathan Brandis plays the hapless and clueless kid to perfection while Caroline Williams entertains as the suspicious and somewhat obnoxious bestfriend and neighbor making the perfect foil for O'Quinn.The film was born in the era of mindless yet enjoyable slasher sequels and it shows. There is a lot of extra violence and gore that was shoehorned in at the last minute much to the dismay of the director and often the film plays for cheap thrills whenever possible. But while it is nowhere near as effective as its predecessor it is an enjoyable and breezy 89 minutes just the same. Worth seeing just to see Terry O'Quinn do his thing once more he would be replaced in the mostly unseen third installment and certainly of interest to any fan of '80s horror just the same.

The film focuses on their interactions and what happens when Machiko takes Shigeki for a drive on his birthday. While other characters assume fleeting roles there is a recurring theme of death and mourning a point that is reinforced by both the title and onscreen comments at film's end.

There are long takes where nothing of much significance seems to transpire and yet the film remains completely engaging. The human drama is depicted as inexplicably linked to nature a poetic theme that Japanese cinema sometimes conveys so effectively.One slight negative there was a little bit of unnecessary camera shake that distracted slightly.

	schema:reviewBody "There are directors who write their own original storiesscripts and directors who bring to the screen works of novelists playwrights and even biographers and historians. The directors who develop their own scripts are not just good filmmakers but arguably potential novelists or playwrights.One such formidable director is Japan's Naomi Kawase. Her films win awards at prestigious film festivals following which the director churns out well received novels in Japanese based on her original filmscripts. Today like Kawase there are exciting filmmakers such as Mexico's Carlos Reygadas and Spain's Alejandro Amenabar The others and Pedro Almodovar Talk to her who need to be appreciated as a breed apart from the regular directors who prefer to ride on the shoulders of other worthies.Kawase's Mourning Forest won the Grand Prize at the 2007 Cannes film festival. Many Western critics missed out on the loaded AsianJapanese cultural subtexts in this remarkable film and even expressed surprise that it won the honor. After viewing the film at the recent 12th International Film Festival of Kerala I applaud the Cannes jury's verdict.Mourning Forest Mogari no mori is a film that centers around a 70yearold man with senile dementia Alzheimer's disease? living in an old age home in Japansomewhat similar to Sarah Polley's Canadian film Away from Home. However the two films approach the problem from totally different perspectivesunderlining the cultural divide between Western and Eastern sensibilities. In both films young people admire the values of the older generation. Both films are indirectly family filmsunderlining undying love for spouses. That's where the similarities end.Mourning Forest is a sensitive film tracing a senile old man's quixotic pilgrimage to his wife's grave in a forest interlocking a mystical relationship with nature. An old man with depleting memory is cared for by a young woman Machiko a new nursing recruit at the retirementold age home. But her name which has similar syllables to the name of his wife Mako who died 33 years before triggers a passion in him to visit her grave in a forest.On the 33rd anniversary according to Japanese Buddhist beliefs the departed must travel to the land of Buddhasomewhat like the Roman Catholic Christian belief of the dead reaching heaven hell after a stay in purgatory. The time has come for the couple to part forever unless he bids farewell soon before the anniversary.Mourning Forest can be divided into two parts.The first part introduces the viewer to the two main charactersthe nurse and the nursed. Both have suffered personal loss and are grievingthe nurse has lost a child for which her husband holds her responsible the nursed has lost his wife and evidently never remarried and keeps writing letters to his dead wife that must be delivered. The nurse dominates the first part. We view the two figures chasing each other between rows of tea bushes their heads clearly visible over the verdant green landscape. There is warmth of the sun. There is an allusion to life.The second part inverses the situation. The nursed dominates the nurse. The nursed tricks the smart young woman as he trudges to his wife's grave. Whether the spot is really her grave or not is of little consequencethe act of undertaking the pilgrimage is of consequence as he has to deliver his letters to his wife before 33 years of her death are completed. The forest covers the human figures. There is cold darkness and mystical overflowing streams that threaten hypothermia. There are definite allusions to death and regeneration. In an interview to a news agency Kawase said After the two enter the forest the forest becomes the force that supports them. It watches over the two of them sometimes gently sometimes more strictly. The films title roughly translates to Forest of Mogari and at the end of the film the director states the meaning of the term mogari. Mogari means the time or act of mourning. Unlike Away from Her Mourning forest is a film on understanding the richer complexities of life and death. Running water never returns to its source says the old man Shigeki to his nurse words of solace for a young woman to look afresh at her marriage after losing a child. If sad things happen you shouldn't be sad about them or fight them but vow to make the world a better place for children still to be born. That's my message Kawase told the Reuters news agency At the Cannes festival director Kawase said she made Mourning Forest because her grandmother was becoming slightly senile and today such people are looked down upon somewhat and pitied forgetting that it could happen to us someday. Kawase said she hoped viewers would learn kindness and a new way of handling difficulties  which she said could help people around the world overcome religious and cultural differences. The nurse strips off her clothes to provide warmth to her ward and protect him from hypothermiaan action that would seem unusual to Western sensibilities. There is no sex here mere practical help in time of need. There are streams that suddenly flood as if they have a life of their own and emerge as a silent character in the film.There is one Japanese film that is somewhat similar in spirit and contentthe 1983 Cannes Golden Palm winner Shohei Imamura's Ballad of Narayama where an active and useful old woman is forced to make a last trip up a mountain to fulfill local traditions and her consequent interactions with younger generations in the village. While Imamura used a famous novel to build a film classic young Kawase has made a rich film using her own story. Kawase is treading in the footsteps of directors Terrence Mallick Reygadas and Tarkovsky when the forest itself is transformed into a metaphor of memories and traditions becoming a source of eternal strength. Kawase represents the finest in contemporary Japanese cinema blending nature and tradition in storytelling.".

	schema:reviewBody "The story is deceptively simple but the psychological depth of the characters and the deep symbolism captured in the everyday scenes of rural Japan are astounding. This movie never gives you too much never lets you take anything for granted never lets you have a clear resolution. Some of the symbols I admit may not be as resonant with nonJapanese audiences and lack the emotional weight that they'd give someone familiar with Japan. The subtle changing of the foliage from early to late summer the association of summer with the return of spirits the idea of mogari as an ancient mortuary ritual of temporary burial that implies a return from beyond all of this is set far in the background of the central story of two grieving people who despite so many other differences between them oldyoung caregivercared for can find some sort of healing connection with each other. Perhaps this is why some think it is boring. They're following the movement of individual characters rather than the whole movement of the story. The story moves from the closeshot narrow confines of life in the old folks home to the field cultivated nature in the chasing scene to the forest wild nature. Along the way the psychological strain of grief becomes gradually more wild more natural and more capable of finding meaning however incomprehensible. Watching mogari requires an eye for these subtle changes which the actors portray compellingly almost as if it was a documentary as well as a deep willingness to empathize with the characters. If you can do this the movie will take you on an emotional rollercoaster throughout. Perhaps that's just part of the nature of grief.".

The subtle changing of the foliage from early to late summer the association of summer with the return of spirits the idea of mogari as an ancient mortuary ritual of temporary burial that implies a return from beyond all of this is set far in the background of the central story of two grieving people who despite so many other differences between them oldyoung caregivercared for can find some sort of healing connection with each other. Perhaps this is why some think it is boring. They're following the movement of individual characters rather than the whole movement of the story. The story moves from the closeshot narrow confines of life in the old folks home to the field cultivated nature in the chasing scene to the forest wild nature. Along the way the psychological strain of grief becomes gradually more wild more natural and more capable of finding meaning however incomprehensible. Watching mogari requires an eye for these subtle changes which the actors portray compellingly almost as if it was a documentary as well as a deep willingness to empathize with the characters. If you can do this the movie will take you on an emotional rollercoaster throughout. Perhaps that's just part of the nature of grief.";

	schema:reviewBody "Winning the Grand Prix of the Cannes Film Festival last year I actually found it a tad difficult to appreciate this piece by Naomi Kawase as compared to Shara. I am beginning to suspect that I have a profound disengagement with movies that deal with grief and loss especially when it takes on a very detached approach in some ways with the characters constantly unable to deal with those emotions for the most parts.The movie opened true to Kawase's penchant for capturing moving air. Here we see lush greenery on tree tops dancing to the motion of wind and vast open fields where blades of grass sway back and forth when caressed by the breeze. It's like watching a National Geographic episode of forests and greenery before the opening credits kicked in to start the film proper. I even suspected that M Night Shyamalan could have paid homage in his The Happening which also had plenty of such shots put into it.The story tells of the relationship that formed between Shigeki Shigeki Uda and Machiko Machiko Ono the former an old man in an elderly home who has been aloof after the lost of his wife some 33 years ago. 33 years is an extremely long time and to miss someone for that long well you know how strong his emotions are to his wife. On the other hand Machiko is a staff at the same elderly home but she too is grieving internally for the loss of her son and her husband squarely puts the responsibility and blame on her petite shoulders.While initially starting off on the wrong foot with fiery misunderstanding they soon hit it off in a game of tag in the great outdoors where the camera pulls back to reveal again the large open spaces and the two protagonists finding and connecting with each other two tiny creatures in the space that Nature offered only to act as a precursor of a more adventurous outing that would come soon after in an excursion that took a turn for the unexpected when their car ran into a ditch.In what seemed to be a wandering around aimlessly on foot deep inside nature herself both Shigeki and Machiko had to depend on each other to keep to their wildlife tour with the former having the objective of wanting to look for his late wife's grave like a pilgrimage in itself. The observations from far earlier gives way to a more intimate look at the two and Shigeki turned into some kind of enigma clutching his all important haversack as they go from set piece to set piece some quaintly quiet while others I seem to make no headway from sudden outbursts which persisted as being more whiny than anything else.Might be a masterpiece for some to appreciate especially with its beautiful cinematography but everything else was certainly lost on me probably due to my lack of extreme patience and I grief in not being able to be moved by this movie.".

Later as Machiko desperately tries to control his reckless quest through the forest we get hints of how she lost her child and the unresolved feelings she has.Although there are gorgeous scenes the two playing amidst rows of geometrically carved hedges for example the handheld cinematography isn't doing the film any favors. It may have been more appropriate in the latter half as their journey takes them deeper into the wild. But the shaky camerawork throughout the entire movie adds nothing. Maybe it just comes naturally to Naomi Kawase whose work is primarily in documentaries although she's no stranger to drama.I don't know if this is an accurate representation of a Japanese senior facility or an idealized one. I know that respect for elders is more ingrained in their culture. The home certainly appears to be a great deal more comfortable dignified and serene than what we have. Perhaps it's a very expensive one though we get no hints that Shigeki is particularly wealthy.I thought it could have explored its themes a bit deeper and there are the aforementioned camera issues but overall I liked the film a great deal.

Thirtythree years is an auspicious time says a Buddhist priest to Shigeki because his wife can now enter nirvana.

The set up is deftly handled with the protagonists' tragedy revealed in violent confrontation with Machiko's husband and opaque but insistent resistance from Shigeki. Makiko Watanabe exemplifies the lowkey naturalistic performances from the actors seemingly in balance with the amateur octogenarians around them. A game of hideandseek in tea fields is endearing.However the best and worst of arthouse is on display here. The mountains forests and streams of Nara look magical and immortal. The sense of timelessness set in contrast to the fading mortality of the carehome residents is profound. However once the story moves towards Machiko and Shigeki's journey through the forest the shots are held longer the lines become sparse and difficult to fathom and there is a lot of walking walking walking... I get that these two are on a journey that will help them realise for Shigeki that his life has had meaning and that for Machiko there is a way to go on through human connection. Somehow this is brought to them by hugging a large dead tree. And falling in streams. And digging. And walking lots of walking.It looks beautiful the actors are charismatic but I am not sure there is really anything else there. Once Upon a Time in Anatolia dealt with similar themes but more poetically with more startling painterly images and with a deeper resonance.

As the two people stray off into the woods I felt anxious on how they are rescued felt anxious with Machiko who without thinking follows Shigeki an old man with dementia and I thought 'Hey when you get lost in mountains you should even go up to the summit'. But actually the director is indifferent on such thrills. She expected the audiences to focus on the imagined scenery of the dementia patient and the care giver. That was why I felt tricked. Though not explained clearly the reason why Machiko came to the care house which is a renovated old farmer's house in mountainous village might be a death of her son. Her husband blames her that if she did not loose her clutch of her son the son would have not died. One day when they had calligraphic exercise Machiko wrote her name. Accidentally this made Shigeki recall his wife's name Mako. Mako died 33 years ago. Since then Shigeki lived in memory of Mako for very long years. Since then mental connection between Machiko and Shigeki gradually grows.One day Machiko takes Shigeki to visit Mako's tomb by car but the car runs off on the way. It is so remote that mobile phone does not work to call for help. But from the place Shigeki walks into the woods heading 'Mako's tomb' and Machiko has no idea but to follow him. Since then many things happen. At night Shigeki feels chilly due to fatigue and coldness Mako warms him naked. The next morning Shigeki is going across dangerous river Mako imagines it suddenly floods and cries and cries until Shigeki comes back. This recalled me 'Sanzu no kawa' an imaginary river that separates the world of quick and the dead. Finally Shigeki arrives at the destination he pulls out notebooks he wrote for 33 years perhaps filled by the memories of Mako and he digs a hole by hand then he peacefully sleeps in it. Besides him Machiko feels healed from all of her past troubles. The motif in the movie is heavy caregiving death of child death of wife and burial. As my mother is in Alzheimer disease I had strong empathy on Shigeki. I think many of the audiences have these kinds of experiences. The message from the movie is as I received to have real feeling of life and healing beyond getting old and death. This attempt is however not very successful because as I wrote in the beginning the audiences may feel tricked at the end.".

We're unsure as to his mental wellbeing  is he well? Does he have dementia? Machiko a beautiful young woman in her 20s with long black hair huge dark eyes and a playful innocence is Shigeko's helper. The head of the home is named Wakako  also young and beautiful but with depth emotion humour. She might be considered the conscious of the film the driving force which projects us to the end. We follow them all for a while during which not a great deal happens other than helping us the audience assess and build trust with these new people in our lives.During the first third we are introduced to Shigeko as he asks the question to nobody in particular 'Am I alive? Am I alive?' We're in the home an idyll overlooking nature on all sides elders happily talking among themselves and up front a monk perhaps responding to Shigeko's rhetorical question. 'Life is two things  there is knowing you are alive because you are living your life eating breathing sleeping. This is the first and more typical answer to your question. You know you are alive for you do the things from which life is made. Then there is the other kind of alive. This is the feeling of being alive. The kiss from a lover the slap from an exlover the beauty of your surroundings. This is what we all desire to feel life to notice that we are alive because we vibrate with it.' He has Machiko who sits nearby hold Shigeko's hand and asks whether he feels the warmth understands the idea of feeling alive. Could this be a Why Am I here story? A Vision story? Perhaps any of the Six Stories..In another scene we see elders and helpers painting their names on sheets of paper. It's serene casual and the camera pauses sways as though disinterested but all the while asking us to see what it sees and right now it sees Machiko and Shigeko sitting adjacent to one another painting. The monk is here again and he and Shigeko discuss his exwife Mako. We learn she died 33 years ago. The monk tells a short story letting Shigeko know that as it has been 33 years since she died Mako would now become a Buddha as we all do 33 years after death. Not only that but she won't be returning to earth. Shigeko sees Machikos painting and begins to deface it first the middle section leaving the name Mako then the remaining letters finally the entire piece ripped and smudged and 'not returning to earth'.. I would describe this scene  without thinking too hard about it  as a ValuesInAction scene. Shigeko understands the lesson the monk provided but isn't happy with the conclusions drawn and acts out.By the by we learn it is Shigeko's birthday the elders and helpers all sing Happy Birthday he smiles and performs the Winston Churchill impression with a twofingered peace sign. And that he has a bag in his apartment which contains precious things so precious in fact that when Machiko attempts to throw them away Shigeko violently pushes her against the wall injuring her wrist. In a consequent scene Wakako and Machiko discuss happiness sadness and life whilst sat respectively in the driver and passenger seat of Wakako's car. Wakako lets Machiko know that she had a lover once who helped cure her of some hangups she had around being serious being right knowing what to do. 'There are no set rules you know'. They repeat this over and over with more laughter and greater meaning on each iteration. This scene may exist to provide a moral centre or to put it more directly a combination Teaching and ValuesInAction story.The final two thirds is where Machiko and Shigeko literally get lost in the forest they were going for a short drive but came off the road trying to avoid a hole. Rather than describe anything else this is for you to discover for yourself.I found the entire film simple yet astonishingly accomplished. Great stories do a lot of heavy lifting with little source material and stay with you long after the telling.Arigato Naomi Kawase.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie won the Grand Prize in Cannes Film Festival. I didn't get it as usual.Discovering your true identity through a journey is in fact my favorite theme for movies and this film at first seemed very promising with interesting characters and beautiful sceneries of the forest. However as the movie progressed I became more and more confused. I'm sure this is one of those movies that's supposed to make you think but way too little information was given even for audience to use their imagination.I actually went back to read the plot synopsis after I finished watching the film all confused and realized for the first time the nurse had previously lost her child. There was a scene where an unknown man saying it's all your fault. Now that I think of it he is probably her exhusband blaming her for the dead child. No matter how you think about it any movie that requires the audience to read plot synopsis to understand the plot is unacceptable as a film. There were many other things in this film that was just outright puzzling but the movie ended without even attempting to explain any of it. I absolutely did not connect with any of the characters. While this film had an extremely beautiful cinematography that alone is not enough to make it a great film as a whole. The screen also shook far too much. I understand this director used to be a documentary filmmaker but that is totally unnecessary for a featurelength film.I actually really liked the female lead actress Ono Machiko but the male lead had too much age difference that I just couldn't see them as a couple. That campfire scene was completely incomprehensible for me.It's very wellknown that Japanese films that win prizes in Cannes rarely fit the typical Japanese tastes. I guess movies especially at film festivals are considered to be art so perhaps truly amazing works are not meant to be understood by an average viewer like me. Or maybe Western audiences simply see the Japanese as a mysterious group of people and liked the mysterious couple in this film behaving erratically in the enigmatic forest.This film like many other Japanese Cannes prizewinners had disastrous user review ratings in Japanese movie sites. I really need to start heeding their advice and not expect too much from these movies.".

Am I still alive? is one of the questions Shigeki asks at the beginning. Their relationship or better their friendship is going to give the answer to Shigeki's question. The Japanese director Kawese Naomi repeatedly uses long shots of trees or rice fields moved by wind. Maybe this observation of the nature should remind the viewer that this is how life is. Everybody will lose somebody in a lifetime but nature carries on and so do we. Kawese doesn't use a plot as a drive for his movie he uses a mixed atmosphere between sadness and joy between loving and hating. Very important in Mogari no mori is also the sound track that is dominated by sounds directly from nature. I had an exhausting day when watching the film and it was hard for me to get lost in these pictures. I am interested how it works on a second viewing.".

	schema:headline " Sympathy Without A Cause required or The Men Can't Take It";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is so depressing most of the way and I fell from the grace of its reincarnation theme at the end. I was so alone when the casts are crying and yelling. The screenplay and the direction may lack some fatal information in this movie but I had to 'understand' this because it won the Grrrrrrrand Prix at the Cannes.Erratic is the word. I had no idea why suddenly Machiko somehow eagerly chased to catch Shigeki after he fell down from the tree. Was it because Shigeki's mischievous action ignited Machiko's frustrated sadness her son's death and Machiko agreed to burst it out with him? In my eyes she hadn't been such frustrated or saying more accurately she looked good at hiding her own secret emotion. If I should understand and recognize her action only by watching that poor explanation well that must be something like sympathy without a cause which I hate most.The latter half of the movie is filled with Machiko's sobbing call Shigekisan Shigekisan. It might imply her hidden cry to call her late son or her husband but to me that sounded too selfindulging. The people on this movie might have extremely sad experience which an ordinary man like me can't even guess. Actually the movie has some snobbish impression due to its lack of explanation. Perhaps Machiko had divorced after her son's death and working for her own. OK it must be hard. But how hard? It's too bold if the director wants me to sympathize with her sadness again only by that little information.Remember the former half of most Kurosawa movies are boring as hell. Even for this Japanese man his bw classics are way too aged and often boring. But that boring pile of information gives the roles their lives. They become even more real than real people when the latter half starts. That's where all the story begins. We need that to get along with the director's lies.It's not even the Eastern Zen style this movie wears. I know some Japanese movies have fine essence of that kind eg. Ozu's but this one only lacks what is needed to be there. It's not even poetic. In poets the lines themselves conveys powerful meanings as well as the spaces between the lines. If the director said the motivation to make this movie was her grandmother's senility then she should know not all grandmother is senile or not every son  daughter realizes its possibility clearly. She may want people to realize that but she did little thing to make that happen.Some nice people acclaim for its cinematography. The scenes might be clean or green but you know what I'd say. Instead I'd like to comment on its sound mixing. At first I thought it was at the director's will when I couldn't hear the main casts' voices clearly and the sound of people or the nature surrounding the main casts were too loud. But it wasn't fixed until the end. I was too tired to see the next round the same director's Sharasouju for which I waited more hopefully when the movie was over. Or was it the cinema theater's fault?I've been saying sht on this movie but there is one big suspension. How do women think about this female director's movie? According to the rating breakdown on IMDb obviously women appreciate this movie. I can't help imagining there is some kind of emotional code in this movie of which only women can share without any further explanation. My comment can be nothing short of the same old men's lack of understanding. But still.".

	schema:headline " A decidedly UNcommon film!";
	schema:reviewBody "Granted that this film shows its age and stagebound origins it nevertheless has a lot to recommend it. Some of its message falls under the rubric of standardissue moralizing but it also tells us that the rich and educated have many of the same vices as the poor and uneducated... sometimes even more so. It also offers some unconventional views on topics such as unwed motherhood social justice and women's independence.The lovely Constance Bennett is eminently watchable as Ellen Neal a young woman fighting against the circumstances of her birth gender and economic situation to make something decent of her life. While the chic sophisticated actress is somewhat cast against type she manages to create a character who is strong sympathetic and believable. Bennett makes us willing to overlook at least most of the time the long string of clichs and incredible coincidences that pass as a plot. She delivers a couple of breathtaking speeches about morality and family values that made me want to stand up and cheer.The movie packs an incredible amount of storysome of it quite farfetchedinto less than 90 minutes. It begins with 18yearold Ellen being arrested in a raid on a speakeasy where so far she's managed to keep her virtue intact at least that's what we're told. A sympathetic judge lets her off with the admonition that she's heading down a bad road. Heeding the warning Ellen eventually manages to find less lucrative but more honest work as the maid for a wealthy uppercrust family the Fullertons. It turns out however that the highsociety folk are no better than the speakeasy lowlifes they swill bootleg whiskey indulge in wild parties and all of the men seem to be on the make particularly for Ellen. Among her pursuers is Hugh the Fullertons' collegeage son played by an appropriately boyish Lew Ayres. Learning of her disreputable past Hugh believes Ellen will be an easy conquest but she fights bravely and eloquently for respect. Eventually though the two fall in love.After Hugh returns to school Ellen discovers she is pregnant. Receiving no response to her letters to Hugh she is forced to quit her job and move back with her mother played with touching sweetness by Beryl Mercer. Following the birth of her son Ellen contacts Hugh's family. Suspecting a shakedown Papa Fullerton played by Purnell Pratt asks family friend Judge Filson played by Hale Hamilton to pay off Ellen and avoid a public scandal at all costs. But Ellen is not looking for money what she wants is for the Fullertons to acknowledge precisely what they wish to keep secret her relationship with Hugh and his paternity of her child. She hires a lawyer the seedy but honest Yates played to eccentric perfection by Tully Marshall to press her claim.Earlier in the film we learn that as a young man Judge Filson himself once fathered a child out of wedlock but that his lowerclass lover made no claim on him for fear that she would ruin his social prospects. He does not know what became of his sweetheart and the child he has never seen.When Judge Filson meets with Ellen he discovers she's not the conniving golddigger he'd expected. As a matter of fact he's quite taken with her and believes her when she insists that Hugh Fullerton fathered her child. Filson encourages Hugh not to repeat his own mistake and to claim both Ellen and the baby. But Hugh's father as well as his friend Bud continue to regard Ellen as lowclass trash and refuse to allow Hugh to reconcile with Ellen.Ellen has no choice but to have her lawyer Yates drag the whole issue into court. The trial scene is not to be believed or missed. Besides some amazing revelations that follow pellmell one after another the scene is a hoot from a legalprocedural point of view. I'll not reveal the outcome but suffice it to say the many many loose ends do get tied up in tidy fashion.It's sad that a movie that's so entertaining so fascinating from a sociohistorical perspective and directed by the great Victor Fleming should be unavailable on video and so rarely shown anywhere. If you have a chance to catch it don't miss the opportunity.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Common Clay' is based on an old stage play and it shows. The action is creaky and stagebound and the highly contrived final revelation relies on an extremely heavy coincidence which comes with an even heavier moral.Ellen Neal Constance Bennett the least attractive of the three Bennett sisters is established as a 'bad girl' who is more sinned against than sinning. We first see her working in a speakeasy yet it's clear that she has few options. When the speakeasy is raided and Ellen is hauled off to court the judge advises her to associate with a better class of people. As in 'An Inspector Calls' it turns out here that the 'better' classes are morally no better than the common people and in fact are even worse. This hasn't been my own experience I hasten to add.Ellen gets a job as a maid in the respectable household of the Fullertons. All is well until their handsome son Hugh comes home from college. His eyes meet Ellen's and we know what's going to happen. Soon enough Ellen has a bun in the oven courtesy of the college boy. A year later when Ellen shows up with a baby whom she claims is Hugh's lovechild Hugh's father suspects a shakedown. To protect his family he orders his attorney Filson to ruin Ellen's reputation such as it is. For some reason everyone addresses Filson as 'Judge' even though he's a solicitor. Ellen's lawyer is named Yates played and overacted by veteran character actor Tully Marshall in a Smith Brothers beard which makes him the only actor in this cast who has something to hide behind. For some reason Judge Filson keeps addressing Yates as 'brother Yates' as if they're siblings. Speaking of Filson's family tree...SPOILER COMING RIGHT NOW. Enter the twist ending upstage left dragging its coincidences across the script. Are you ready? Turns out that badgirl Ellen is the daughter of respectable Judge Filson! When he was a young man the same age as Hugh he decided to sow his wild oats with a woman who loved him but whom he didn't choose to marry. After she gave birth to his daughter she decided to commit suicide instead of compelling Filson to marry her ... so as not to stand in the way of Filson's promising career as a lawyer. Hoo boy to this and the hooboy factor gets even worse because Ellen's foster mother is played by Beryl Mercer the single most annoying performer in the entire history of Hollywood. Film historian William K Everson agreed with me on this. Fortunately Mercer's 'contribution' to this particular movie is largely confined to one long courtroom scene. Elsewhere Mercer has polluted dozens of good movies with her whines her snivels her tremblings her whimpered begorrahs.The sure hand of director Victor Fleming guides this material about as ably as it can be done. Not much. I admire Constance Bennett for her work on behalf of the American military she is buried in Arlington National Cemetery but her appeal as an actress has always eluded me. Constance Bennett's sisters Joan and Barbara were much sexier and more talented. Barbara Bennett was the mother of notorious chatshow host Morton Downey Jnr. Here Constance claims to be only 18 oh yes and she speaks her dialogue in a peculiar accent broadening all her A's. When she gets arrested for some reason the police fingerprint only two of her fingers. There's a continuity error involving her mug shots. And it's hugely implausible that the Fullertons would engage a butler with the coarse Cockney accent spoken here by actor Charles McNaughton.'Common Clay' was a stage vehicle for Jane Cowl an important stage actress of the early 20th century who made few films and who is now forgotten. If this film had starred Cowl it might at least have rated some historical significance as a record of her stage performance. Any movie that gives Tully Marshall a chance to shine is welcome but he did much better work for Victor Fleming with much better material in 'Red Dust'. Hale Hamilton is excellent in his role as Bennett's father. Beryl Mercer needs her sinuses cleaned out. Among other things. I'll rate this bathetic sobfest just 2 points out of 10.".

After all she is one of the most beautiful women in the world. I think this movie should not be over analyzed. Just sit back relax and enjoy it. It is mildly suspenseful and romantic and fun.

As one of the very few DelonDeneuve pairings it's nothing much the only surprising thing about their love scene is how early into the film it comes. Delon has played this kind of role a million times before but he does give a convincing performance and easily at least on this occasion outclasses Deneuve. They both go for a rather inexpressive style of acting but you can read a lot more on his face that you can on hers. For those who might care he also has a fullfrontal nude scene in this film BUT it's shot from a long distance and he's behind a glass wall. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Yet another superficial yet mildly entertaining timewaster in the crime genrea crimewaster. Alain Delon and Deneuve must be about the bestlooking pair in cinema even if they were not so young anymore in 1982. But that only carries so much weight. This is another in the long line of stories about a hit man who wants out of the business. In this case it's not so much that he knows too much it's that he's too good at his job and nobody can truly replace him. When Delon informs the crime boss a Monsieur Cox that he wants out Cox tries to tempt him with money but Delon stands his ground. After a violent episode he knows he must flee Paris. His exwife Stphane Audran gets him a turkey factory usine de dindon really a turkey farm as a cover for his disappearance. Once there overrun by frightened fowl he discovers employee Deneuve who lives with her abusive drunken atonaljazzobsessed husband. To the harsh strains of Anthony Braxton the two men face off and reach a stalemate. The husband departs and the two lovely stars pair up. Later when hit men plus one woman turn up in retribution for one of Delon's past jobs some entertaining and overthetop violence ensues as Deneuve manages to help Delon overtake the gang when she thrusts a fireplace poker clear through the woman ouch!!. The violence here and elsewhere is quite graphic. The rest of the film consists of numerous narrow escapes and 'deux ex machina' resolutions. Delon and Deneuve are both much better than this material which was cowritten and codirected by Monsieur Delon. If you don't take it too seriously it's fun to watch the ridiculous violence and the occasionally beautiful locations.".

	schema:headline " Like a thriller and a romance merged into one film";
	schema:reviewBody "Wow...what a castCatherine Deneuve and Alain Delon. With two such wonderful actors I would sure expect a lot from this film. However despite the movie's poster showing both actors and this being from a Catherine Deneuve DVD set she doesn't even appear until well into the movie! The film finds Delon some sort of worldclass assassin. He works for Mr. Cox and the Organizationwhatever that means. I assume it's organized crime but perhaps it's some governmental organization. Anyway Delon is tiring of the jet set like of international assassinations and has decided to quit. However Cox will hear nothing of it and begins sending flunkies and assassins to either convince Delon to unretire or die. But Delon is too cool and too good at his craft and the plans fail.In the meantime Delon collects his money from his safe deposit box and asks a wacky lady who has been managing his money to tell him what she's invested it in. Oddly she sunk all the money into a turkey farm! Once Delon disappears he resurfaces in Normandyat the turkey farm run by Deneuve. At this point it's 30 minutes into the film when they meet. You assume they'll simply fall in love...but this isn't exactly correct as Deneuve's character is already marriedthough the guy is a total jerk and alcoholic who incidentally listens to the most godawful style of jazz you could imagine. It's soon obvious that their marriage is a very unhappy one and before you can say 'idiot husband' Delon and Deneuve are making love like crazed weasels!Some time passes during which you really come to hate the husband. Suddenly when Delon and Deneuve return home to the turkey farm they find four assassins in the homewith guns and a great willingness to use them. They kill the husband how convenient but then Devenuve and Delon take them outand flee the place as more like them are soon to follow. However when Delon goes to check for his hidden stash of money it seems someone has been there firstand it's gone. Eventually Cox catches up to Delon. He offers to not only return the money but give him a bonusprovided he do one more job. In the meantime they hold Deneuve prisoner to guarantee his cooperation. But who is this target and will they really allow him to walk with his money? Tune in and see for yourself.To me this is like two separate movies that are uncomfortably merged. The first is a supercool thriller about a megacool assassin. I loved this part of the film and enjoyed Delon's cold and cool demeanor. the second is a romancewhich to me seemed forced and unnecessary. I really think the film could have been better had they stuck with the assassin film alonekeeping it more focused and consistent with Delon's character. As it was his relationship with Deneuve seemed improbable and out of characteras Delon never showed any signs of being a nice guy up until thenjust tough and very professional. In fact all the parts with Deneuve seemed to slow down the film tremendouslyand I wanted more of the cool assassin. This part of the film sure reminded me of another excellent Delon film Le Samouraiand I wanted to see much more like it. Overall it's worth seeingbut terribly uneven. It could have been great.By the way when the guy is shot in the pool where is the blood?! Watch this scene and see what I mean.".

DeMille production of JM Barrie's play The Admirable Crichton with a few DeMille flourishes.Crichton Thomas Meighan is a very proper butler in a staid British home. Of course he has a distant crush on Lady Mary Gloria Swanson a very pampered and spoiled young lady. Tweeny the household maid Lila Lee has a crush on Crichton.The family headed by a silly old man Theodore Roberts decides to take a sailing trip to the South Seas and gathers up a party of family and friends. Of course they run the yacht into a rock and are washed ashore on a deserted island. The rich are all nitwits and haven't a clue how to do anything for themselves. They assume Meighan and Lee will continue to wait on them. Wrong.Slowly it occurs to everyone that there is a new order on the island. The crafty and selfsufficient Meighan sets out to build a shelter a fire harvest food etc. while the rich sit and watch. Their attempts to copy him are sadly disastrous. Eventually they join the former butler's group with Meighan as a sort of king.Among the items that have washed ashore after the wreck is a book of poems that talks about a Babylonian king. In a typical DeMille moment Swanson daydreams about her life in a Babylonian court. The sequence that follows ranks among the most famous in silent film history as Meighan becomes the Babylonian king who sentences the reluctant maiden Swanson to the lions' den as his jealous courtesan Bebe Daniels gleefully watches. The scene is much shorter than I remembered as the fabulously gowned Swanson walks in among the lions. The famous scene of the barebacked Swanson with the roaring lion atop her was very real no double.And so the merry band of islanders under King Crichton goes on for a few years until just before the marriage of Swanson and Meighan they are rescued and returned to their former lives and stations.Meighan and Swanson are terrific. Roberts is funny as the old man. The supporting cast includes Julia Faye as a maid Robert Cain as Swanson's boring suitor Edmund Burns as the vicar Raymond Hatton as the silly ass Ernie Mildred Reardon as Lady Agatha and Rhy Darby as the pitiful Lady Duncraigie who marries her chauffeur.Logic aside this is a stylish and solid film and features a ravishing 20yearold Gloria Swanson in one of her first big hits for DeMille. Another famous scene is early in the film as Swanson prepares to taker her morning bath a ritual that includes several maids gallons of rose water and another of DeMille's groundbreaking interior designs.A must see for fans of silent films.".

	schema:headline " Babylon has fallen and Bill Crichton must play the game";
	schema:reviewBody "The silent films of Cecil B DeMille scripted by his longtime collaborator and mistress Jeanie MacPherson were often bizarre overwrought and sometimes just plain silly. Once in a while however they hit the nail right on the head. Male and Female heavily adapted from JM Barrie's play The Admirable Crichton is a powerful drama with some strong performances DeMille's direction at its most lyrical and MacPherson's storyline only occasionally veering off the rails.The majority of DeMille films from this part of his career begin with a lengthy title card with some kind of moral or motto. However Male and Female opens with images  the crashing sea a sunset  before getting onto the intertitles. The typical DeMille silent would then follow this up by introducing us to each of the main characters with a title followed by a shot of them. Male and Female is no exception but it works these introductions into the film's world and draws the audience in by making them pointofview shots of a young servant peeping through the keyholes into his masters' and mistresses' bedrooms.The acting style that DeMille had encouraged and developed in his silent pictures since the mid1910s was largely naturalistic but with the occasional broad theatrical gesture to highlight a dramatic moment. It was a style that reduced the need for intertitles without resorting to ridiculous pantomiming. The two leads Gloria Swanson and Thomas Meighan are both perfectly suited to this style. Meighan was probably the finest male actor DeMille had worked with since Sessue Hayakawa in 1915's The Cheat and his performance here is mesmerising. Swanson is also great as usual although I have to say that although it was her run of pictures with DeMille that made her name she didn't do her best work with him. Her talent was put to far better use in later features such as Queen Kelly and Sadie Thompson.Aside from the performances it's the dramatic story and its presentation that makes Male and Female so memorable. Only the basic plot of Barrie's play remains and this is a typical DeMilleMacPherson story of the reversal of fortune and forbidden love  probably the strongest of this kind that they did before the slant in DeMille's films became increasingly moralist and of course religious. Although DeMille loved these tales of class and inequality he was at that point a socialist as well as a Christian it is the impossible love between the two leads that is at the heart of this story. The real tragedy of Male and Female has nothing to do with the selfish pomposity of the aristocrats  it is the fact that the love between the rich woman and the poor man can only exist in this fantasy world of the remote island. This is set up from the beginning with the subplot of Swanson's friend who marries her chauffeur and becomes a social outcast. The final scenes in which the various love triangles are resolved are incredibly moving.The only significant wrong note in Male and Female is a brief and rather pointless flashback to ancient Babylon. These historical inserts had been en vogue since Griffith's Intolerance a more influential film than some would have us believe but this one is rather lacklustre and it's hard to see exactly how it fits the main story. It appears more of an excuse for DeMille to work in some epic grandeur from 1918 to 1922 he only made contemporary dramas and comedies and MacPherson to explore her interest in reincarnation. The story does need a dramatic highpoint at the stage where the flashback comes in but they could have done better than the Babylon sequence. Overall however Male and Female is free of much of the preachiness questionable morality and plot holes that mar many of Jeanie MacPherson's screenplays.Male and Female was Paramount's highest grossing film of 1919 which is no surprise. DeMille's steady flow of captivating images and his emphasis on acting performances are at their best here. In certain aspects it may appear dated but as with many of DeMille's films we have to suspend our dependence on realism and plausibility. Of course the island where the action takes place with its convenient abundance of edible wildlife sailing distance from England yet remote enough to be shipwrecked for two years could never really exist  but it's an unreal place created to serve the story. Taken as the silent melodrama that it is this is a stunning motion picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1952 humorist S.J. Perelman contributed a piece to The New Yorker magazine devoted to Cecil B. DeMille's silent drama Male and Female. He was a teenager when the movie was first released in 1919 and found it so enthralling he sat through it twice. More than thirty years later Perelman by then a middleaged playwright and essayist saw the film again at the Museum of Modern Art and recorded his impressions. It goes without saying for anyone familiar with the man's work that his piece is hilarious but what's surprising is how little he exaggerated. I read his essay long before I saw the movie itself and assumed that when he quoted title cards or described the action he was employing artistic license to get laughs but no he described the film with journalistic accuracy and yet his article is laughoutloud funny. Time has not been kind to Male and Female that is if DeMille honestly intended to say something profound about class and gender relations but viewed in the proper spirit the movie is still quite entertaining. Certainly it offers sumptuous production values and topnotch cinematography and happily survives in beautiful condition while most of the performances are surprisingly nuanced. It's the storytelling technique that lacks subtlety for DeMille was a moralist who could never make his points delicately when there was a sledgehammer handy.The story is based on J. M. Barrie's 1902 stage play The Admirable Crichton a satire on the English class system that has been staged repeatedly and adapted into all sorts of movies over the years and no wonder it presents a deeply satisfying fantasy of virtue recognized and bogus class distinctions overturnedtemporarily anyway. Crichton dignified butler in a household full of pampered lazy snobs proves to be the most useful person present when the whole gang is shipwrecked on a remote island in the South Seas. In the version made in the '30s We're Not Dressing with Bing Crosby and Carole Lombard this premise was turned into a musical comedy while a 1957 English adaptation followed the satirical elements of the play more closely but DeMille had his own distinctive approach to the material. As the title suggests Male and Female plays up the romanticerotic aspects of the role reversal giving audiences of 1919 some of the steamiest situations then permissible.The naughty tone is set early on when an impish serving boy who works in the stately household of Lord Loam peeks through bedroom keyholes giving us our first look at each major character via keyhole shot. The most dramatic intro is reserved for the beautiful haughty Lady Mary Gloria Swanson who rises from her luxurious bed and is promptly accompanied by serving girls into her marbled bathroom for a descent into a sunken tuband celluloid immortality! This bathing sequence was an instant sensation and lives on in the textbooks as the most famous such scene in silent cinema. Today it's a little difficult to imagine what all the fuss was about but I'll bet your eyes won't wander from the screen. Miss Swanson was at the peak of her youthful beauty at this time with a special charisma all her own.Once the plot gets under way the opening sequences set up the thesis question can lovers who cross class boundaries find happiness or is kindtokind the only formula that works? The question is put to the test on a South Sea voyage when the Loam family's rented yacht hits the rocks splinters apart and strands them on an uncharted island along with loyal Crichton and scullery maid Tweeny the adorable Lila Lee who is slavishly devoted to him but well aware of the charged relationship between he and Lady Mary. Crichton soon establishes himself as the only person present who knows how to live on an island he can build a fire hunt and cook a good meal so his authority is grudgingly recognized. Two years pass and here's where the inescapably silly elements of the story kick in. Crichton is now the unquestioned but benevolent ruler of an idyllic jungle paradise. Like the Swiss Family Robinson or Gilligan and his friends our castaways live in elaborate primitive huts that look like rustic vacation cabins where everyone wears designer pelts. Clothes horse Gloria even has a Peter Panstyle hat with a feather! We note the altered relationship between the onetime butler and his former employers Lady Mary who commanded Crichton with such hauteur in the opening scenes now literally fights with Tweeny over the privilege of serving him his dinner. And it's finally explained why Mary and Crichton repeatedly yet unwittingly quote a passage of Victorian poetry concerning antiquity. It seems that in a past life Crichton was a Babylonian King and Lady Mary was a Christian slave a defiant captive the King was unable to subdue thus compelling him to feed her to the sacred lions of Ishtar. This is all enacted in a jawdropping flashback played absolutely straight. The slave's dying curse is that the King will suffer for his deed throughout the ages and so now naturally she is his superior and he waits on heralthough on the island of course their roles have reverted to what they once were back in ancient Babylon.After that bizarre episode there is little left to do but arrange for the timely rescue of the castaways and then conclude with Barrie's ironic finale in which the class system reasserts itself and all our characters revert to type. Crichton earns himself a happy ending however and so does the longsuffering Tweeny. This movie was a smash hit in its day and it remains a kitschy treat for silent film buffs who enjoy exquisitely produced hokum. If you can find a copy of Perelman's essay it may help to have it handy as a sort of Viewer's Guide while you watch Male and Female he captures its grandeur as well as its absurdity with admirable precision.".

	schema:headline " An early silent worth watching  C.B. DeMille  Gloria Swanson";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of several silent movies that are still interesting to watch. Male and Female is an early effort by Cecil B. DeMille and it stars Gloria Swanson who was about 20 when it was made. Her costar is Thomas Meighan who was 20 years her senior and the bigger star in 1919 when Male and Female was made. But adorable Lila Lee steals the show as the scullery maid Tweeny.Silent movies were very different from talkies. The beginning of the movie introduces the viewers to the cast of characters and tells who plays each role. The introduction is unnecessary and very leisurely reminding us that audiences in 1919 were very unsophisticated. The title role is Crichton the family butler to the family of Lord Loam. DeMille has Meighan introduce his character very elegantly making Crichton admirable from our first view of him the movie is based on a play called The Admirable Crichton. All characterization is done in mime of course so the camera lingers on Meighan's face as Crichton's emotions flicker across. Meighan was quite a good actor effortless and devoid of the mugging we often associate with silent films most of our experience is with clips from the Keystone Kops it seems to me. Lila Lee is equally good here playing a maid who is in love with Crichton but who can see his secret crush on Lady Mary Lasenby played by Swanson a love which must never speak its name because it crashes against the boundary of class.The family sails to the South Pacific with Crichton and Tweeny in tow and they apparently run aground on Santa Catalina which substitutes for a tropical paradise. It is here that roles reverse completely as Crichton somehow knows all the skills not only to survive but to live in royal comfort after two years on the island they have a forge and appear to have made their pots and pans so well they can be used as mirrors a potter's wheel a lovely home more food than they can eat and Crichton is treated as the king with Tweeny and Lady Mary having a cat fight to see who gets to serve his dinner to him.The lack of sophistication in early movies is either charming or damning depending on your point of view. They use bows which are barely able to launch the arrows out of the frame of the film parts of the island are clearly a movie set with palm trees and brush but outside views really do look like they were shot on Santa Catalina a mountainous island without trees there's no indication of how these people were able to get iron but we have a large smelting operation with bellows and kiln made of apparently fireproof bricks. We let those objections pass.Since this is a C.B. DeMille movie we have a fantasy scene from Babylon which is more interesting than the movie foreshadowing DeMille's rise as the master of spectacle with a cast of thousands and sets to match. In the fantasy Crichton plays a Babylonian king Tweeny his wouldbe queen and Lady Mary the Christian slave captured but refusing to kneel. Crichton tells her to accept his advances willingly or go to the lions Lady Mary of course chooses death before debauchery. These scenes show DeMille already advanced in setting up tableaux and scenery which are beautifully composed and shot.Our hero and his charges are rescued and returned to England where the roles are unreversed and Crichton returns to being a servant unable to marry Lady Mary who has learned to love him. Instead Crichton accepts Tweeny as his wife they emigrate to America and live happily ever after as farmers. At the end we see Lady Mary accepting the offer of marriage from a suitor who acknowledges that her love will always be with the absent Crichton and the last shot of her fades with Swanson showing an empty sadness. We then dissolve into Crichton and Tweeny on their farm and the movie ends with their embrace both obviously in love. I'm sorry to have missed what I think would have been some excellent character development in seeing how Tweeny made Crichton's love bloom apparently making him forget Lady Mary. To Lee's credit I think she could have pulled it off. And I miss Lady Mary's remorse in choosing not to marry Crichton for love choosing instead to maintain her peerage and her money. This is an interesting movie in spite of its shortcomings. We see Gloria Swanson at the start of her career many of us remember her better for her role in Sunset Boulevard released in 1950 where she played the aging actress with the constant refrain I'm ready for my close up Mr. DeMille. In 1919 Thomas Meighan was at his peak a manly man with a soft streak for beautiful women. And Lila Lee had not yet suffered her several failures of luck work and health. We also see that DeMille was not at his best with naturalistic scripts and that his segue into epic movies was a good career move.Silent movies can be truly beautiful as the directors lighting directors and cinematographers worked together to create shots as compelling as still photograph. The silent camera can linger on an empty shot then have a character enter and pose beautifully lighted in luscious black and white while we admire the tableau. For some reason none of this works in color. Black and white film made better photographers of its directors. DeMille showed his genius for sets and spectacle in the Babylon fantasy while letting the main story fall to mere competence.Sunset Boulevard of course is a remarkable movie in its own right. The cast included not only Gloria Swanson but Cecil B. DeMille himself Eric von Stroheim Buster Keaton Hedda Hopper and other wellknown actors.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is one of several silent movies that are still interesting to watch. Male and Female is an early effort by Cecil B. DeMille and it stars Gloria Swanson who was about 20 when it was made. Her costar is Thomas Meighan who was 20 years her senior and the bigger star in 1919 when Male and Female was made. But adorable Lila Lee steals the show as the scullery maid Tweeny.Silent movies were very different from talkies. The beginning of the movie introduces the viewers to the cast of characters and tells who plays each role. The introduction is unnecessary and very leisurely reminding us that audiences in 1919 were very unsophisticated. The title role is Crichton the family butler to the family of Lord Loam. DeMille has Meighan introduce his character very elegantly making Crichton admirable from our first view of him the movie is based on a play called The Admirable Crichton. All characterization is done in mime of course so the camera lingers on Meighan's face as Crichton's emotions flicker across. Meighan was quite a good actor effortless and devoid of the mugging we often associate with silent films most of our experience is with clips from the Keystone Kops it seems to me. Lila Lee is equally good here playing a maid who is in love with Crichton but who can see his secret crush on Lady Mary Lasenby played by Swanson a love which must never speak its name because it crashes against the boundary of class.The family sails to the South Pacific with Crichton and Tweeny in tow and they apparently run aground on Santa Catalina which substitutes for a tropical paradise.

	schema:headline " James Matthew Barrie's Admirable Crichton Comes Alive On Screen";
	schema:reviewBody "Delightful silent film about a shipwrecked British family and their servants with a great cast story based on James Matthew Barrie's classic play The Admirable Crichton. The class structure in Britain at the time is gently ridiculed throughout and therein lies the fun. Special mention goes to Thomas Meighan's incredible performance as the butler Crichton who falls in love with the aristocratic daughter of Lord Loam Lady Mary. Thomas was so manly tall muscular and handsome completely fascinating to watch in this role and every other role I have ever seen him in. No wonder he was so popular as a leading man in silents. As far as I am concerned he stole the show. You couldn't take your eyes off him.Gloria Swanson brings a vulnerability to her role which in the beginning is pretty unsympathetic. During their time on the island she grows the most emotionally and one cannot help but feel sad for her at the end. Her character gets the fuzzy end of the lollipop a philandering future hubbie and the scullery maid Tweeny pixie Lila Lee gets the Grand Prize and moves to America to start a new life with Crichton. One strange thing about this version there was a crew of men on board the boat but after the shipwreck they are not seen or heard from again. What happened to them? Only Lord Loam and his children and two servants survive as far as we can determine. Yet we see this crew rowing away from the site of the wreck two years go by and they are never accounted for. Odd.The musical score is pretty here but sounded a bit synthetic at times. I would have preferred a straight piano score her piano moments were lovely. I really enjoyed this silent film. But then I have read almost everything James Barrie has written so it's not surprising I would love Male and Female based on his play. I just wish at least one of the silent versions of his The Little Minister would have survived especially the one with Betty Compson.".

	schema:reviewBody "A fairly ridiculous upstairs downstairs silent film romancecastaway adventure.There are two parts to this film  the first two hours and the last 20 seconds. Those final 20 second color all which come before it in a most surprising manner.But first the initial two hours. We begin in Victorian England. Virtuous intelligent hard working servants must wait on inept frivolous and decadent aristocracy. Lady Mary Lasenby Gloria Swanson's character is the most conceited of them all  haughtily lounging extravagantly bathing in rose scented water and obnoxiously ridiculing Crichton the intelligent and industrious butler about her morning toast.After establishing this social dynamic De Mille turns everything on its head by having the group's ship wreck on a deserted island while out on a pleasure cruise a la Gilligan. Castaway on the island the 'law of nature' prevails over Victorian hierarchy and Crichton is soon established as the group's leader because of his bravery industriousness and intelligence. Crichton is the leopardskin wearing king building a little village on the island equipped with numerous contraptions even The Professor would marvel at. Further previously vain and bratty Lady Lasenby falls in love with Crichton. They are to marry but mid I do a ship arrives to save them. Instantly before the first English sailor has disembarked to rescue them the Victorian hierarchy demands all of them return to their previous roles. After years as the leopardskin king Crichton is instantly the butler again. Victorian social rules supercede Crichton's natural skills and he must return a servant Victorian social rule supercede Lady Lasenby's love and she knows they can never marry. To drive home the point of how disastrous their marriage would be despite their love Lady Lasenby's friend who stooped to marry her chauffeur arrives to see Lady Lasenby penny less and shunned the proof of society's condemnation of those who break the rules.And here is where the first movie ends  a tragic love story about the constraints of Victorian society  not unlike Age of Innocence or many other comedies of manners.But then you have the final scene in the last 20 seconds. Previously we learned Crichton is leaving for America and says marring Tweeny the maid to escape the unbearable condition he has returned to in England. Cut to the final scene. There is a startling change of scenery  a little wood house out on the American prairie. Crichton is just coming home from plowing the fields of their farm and Tweeny is out to meet him. They embrace and kiss the film ends and the poignancy of De Mille's final statement reworks everything in the previous two hours. De Mille's statement is about the promise of America and its effect is more powerful than just about any political speech I can recall. Crichton is happy and will be happy because here in America we reward based on natural ability and hard work. We have seen what Crichton is capable of and De Mille wants us to imagine his accomplishments in a land that will allow him to flourishes. It is American democratic propaganda second only to It's a Wonderful Life in effectiveness. An astounding political accomplishment considering America is not even a thought in this film until the final scene. The single stationary shot of Crichton walking from his field to his wife is a stirring persuasive tribute to the American dream.Regardless of whether you buy the propaganda or not it is worth a viewing to see how effectively De Mille presents it.This film is also noteworthy because it is the first time De Mille directed Swanson a collaboration made famous by Sunset Blvd.Should you see it? If only to compare it with It's a Wonderful Life as an endorsement of the American dream.".

	schema:headline " There's No Place like Loam!";
	schema:reviewBody "Male and Female is another of ProducerDirector Cecil B. De Mille's comedydramas. This one is about role reversal and makes one think of Gilligan's Island the farcical TV series that was popular in the 60s.The Loam family is a group of spoiled upper crust British nobles which include Lord Loam Theodore Roberts his daughters Lady Jane Lasenby Gloria Swanson and Agatha Lasenby Mildred Reardon along with Agatha's husband or suitor I'm not sure which The Honorable Ernest Wolley Raymond Hatton. They are served by the butler Crichton Thomas Meighan and maid Tweeney lila Lee. Crichton is secretly in love with Lady Jane but despises her spoiled antics The toast is too soft Crichton. Tweeney is in love with Crichton and so it goes.Lady Jane becomes engaged to marry the stuffy Lord Brockelhurst Robert Cain much to the dismay of Crichton. The family plans a south seas cruise and brings along Crichton Tweeney and a young minister named Treherne Edmund Burns. The party is ship wrecked on a remote island. Being of the spoiled upper class the family is unable to cope with living in the wilderness. Crichton steps up and gradually takes command of the situation.The family at first rejects the idea of taking orders from their servant but soon hunger and the need for shelter prevail. The family members gradually pitch in and learn to live off the land. Crichton seems to enjoy the role reversal where Lady Jane and Agatha are now forced to serve him. Two years pass.After Crichton rescues Lady Jane from a leopard we are transported in Crichton and Lady Jane's imagination to ancient Babylon where Crichton is the King and Lady Jane a Christian. The King has a favorite Bebe Daniels who languishes at his feet in a web like head dress. When the Christian refuses to be a slave to the king she walks into the lion's den and is eaten.Cut back to the present where Crichton and Lady Jane plan to be marries by Treherne. Just as the ceremony is being performed Tweeney spots a passing ship and the party is rescued. They return to England where..............................................................Its hard to imagine that no hanky panky went on during the party's two year odyssey but that's what we're supposed to believe. The flashback sequence though lavishly staged is really unnecessary.The performances are generally good. Gloria Swanson was born to play the spoiled rich girl and looks lovely doing so. Lila Lee is equally beautiful as the love lorn Tweeney. Theodore Roberts and Raymond Hatton are mere cartoon characters. But it is Thomas Meighan who stands out. Being head and shoulders taller than the diminutive Ms. Swanson he exudes leadership authority and male virility as Crichton.It's not a bad movie but I challenge you not to think of Gilligan's Island when watching it.".

This one is about role reversal and makes one think of Gilligan's Island the farcical TV series that was popular in the 60s.The Loam family is a group of spoiled upper crust British nobles which include Lord Loam Theodore Roberts his daughters Lady Jane Lasenby Gloria Swanson and Agatha Lasenby Mildred Reardon along with Agatha's husband or suitor I'm not sure which The Honorable Ernest Wolley Raymond Hatton. They are served by the butler Crichton Thomas Meighan and maid Tweeney lila Lee. Crichton is secretly in love with Lady Jane but despises her spoiled antics The toast is too soft Crichton. Tweeney is in love with Crichton and so it goes.Lady Jane becomes engaged to marry the stuffy Lord Brockelhurst Robert Cain much to the dismay of Crichton. The family plans a south seas cruise and brings along Crichton Tweeney and a young minister named Treherne Edmund Burns. The party is ship wrecked on a remote island. Being of the spoiled upper class the family is unable to cope with living in the wilderness. Crichton steps up and gradually takes command of the situation.The family at first rejects the idea of taking orders from their servant but soon hunger and the need for shelter prevail. The family members gradually pitch in and learn to live off the land. Crichton seems to enjoy the role reversal where Lady Jane and Agatha are now forced to serve him. Two years pass.After Crichton rescues Lady Jane from a leopard we are transported in Crichton and Lady Jane's imagination to ancient Babylon where Crichton is the King and Lady Jane a Christian. The King has a favorite Bebe Daniels who languishes at his feet in a web like head dress. When the Christian refuses to be a slave to the king she walks into the lion's den and is eaten.Cut back to the present where Crichton and Lady Jane plan to be marries by Treherne. Just as the ceremony is being performed Tweeney spots a passing ship and the party is rescued. They return to England where..............................................................Its hard to imagine that no hanky panky went on during the party's two year odyssey but that's what we're supposed to believe. The flashback sequence though lavishly staged is really unnecessary.The performances are generally good. Gloria Swanson was born to play the spoiled rich girl and looks lovely doing so. Lila Lee is equally beautiful as the love lorn Tweeney. Theodore Roberts and Raymond Hatton are mere cartoon characters. But it is Thomas Meighan who stands out. Being head and shoulders taller than the diminutive Ms. Swanson he exudes leadership authority and male virility as Crichton.It's not a bad movie but I challenge you not to think of Gilligan's Island when watching it.";

	schema:reviewBody "With The Cheat and The Whispering Chorus Cecil B. DeMille demonstrated talent and a willingness to experiment. For me watching Male and Female was like witnessing the death of an artist because with it he never looked back. I don't mean to say he never made a worthwhile picture again but those films for the most part are fundamentally based on the same principles sex sells and so does exotica. He used biblical stories later because it's an obvious way to feature that without it seeming so trashy.Male and Female looks lovely of course but that's as shallow as the rich family in the story. I doubt anyone at this time knew more about how tinting glosses a picture than DeMille and his crew. His earlier picture Carmen 1915 is another exercise in that. He and his thenusual cinematographer Alvin Wyckoff were also masters of lighting. Male and Female contains such beautiful shots as a silhouette of Crichton carrying Lady Mary to shore. Unfortunately there's not much beyond it.This film seems to be social commentary but there's so many holes in it that it seems DeMille barely gave it any thought. Crichton is as superficial as his masters are he loves the helpless spoiled fool Lady Mary rather than the devoted maid who loves him. Gloria Swanson is beautiful after all. The ironic twist is that Crichton has his former masters become his servants. What's the moral here if any? Is it that class distinctions are largely arbitrary? I didn't need a movie to tell me that. The many intertitles try to find a moralrepeatedlyuntil we might think we did learn something.Plot holes are frequent as well. Where are the yachtsmen in sailor outfits after the shipwreck? And the drinking place of the leopards must be a dangerous spotbecause they sit there and he tells her a story! This is merely a silly romance. It isn't making a statement or commenting on reality or showing it the purpose of this film is to get all the sizzle it can out of a relationship between a dominating male and submissive female of course one that's stubborn at first to have an exotic Babylonian fantasy sequence and to have a bath scene. It's usually about money but that's all these moves attain.By the time of the Babylonian fantasy all the social commentary is lost. I don't care much for films of social commentary it's the disingenuousness of Male and Female that I find condescending. The film left me wondering whether the characters understand the difference between reality and illusion the real character of a person and the illusion of right to social status. Crichton and Lady Mary imply that they believe the Babylonian fantasy to actually be a past life. What's clear is that DeMille would make a career out of blurring such distinctions in the cheapest of ways.".

The characters are exactly that they add a richness to the story that is well developed here by the likes of the delightful scullery maid Lila Lee and Lady Agatha  who has about as much common sense as a teabag Mildred Reardon as well as Mayme Kelso ensuring due propriety at the end...

The play differed from the film in that in the play Lord Loam considered class division artificial and during tea parties servants were expected to mingle with the guests as equals  only Crichton the butler disapproves feeling everyone should know their place.The Loam family are introduced as upper class twits with more money than sense. The house is run by the servants  in particular Crichton Thomas Meighan the Loam's dignified butler who is always at the ready to show people the right way of doing things especially adoring scullery maid Tweeny Lila Lee and boot boy Buttons Wesley Barry. The family beauty  Lady Mary gorgeous Gloria Swanson is completely spoilt and has servants to cater to her every whim from seeing her bathwater is just the right temperature to making sure her toast is not too soft. There is a wonderful bathroom scene with all the most modern conveniences including luxurious rose water spraying from a fountain.The Loams go on a South Sea cruise but disaster strikes as their boat hits a rock and they have to make their way to an uninhabited island. True characters come to the fore the family are lazy and expect their servants to obey their every whim. Crichton soon shows himself a true leader and everyone in the party turns to him for guidance. Two years pass and everyone is living together as equals and pulling their weight there is no master or servant  all except Crichton who is now the supreme leader. Mary and Tweeny now fight for the opportunity to serve him supper. Being a DeMille production there is a spectacular Biblical scene maybe his first with Meighan as a bored callous King Bebe Daniels as a saucy slave girl and Gloria Swanson as a beggar maid who goes to the lion's den rather than put aside her Christian principles.They are eventually rescued and Crichton and Lord Loam are the first to remember their places in the world. Lady Mary can't forget her love they were just about to be married when the rescue boat is seen. Back in civilization Lord Brockelhurst resumes his courting of Mary  all through the film he has shown himself to be pretty flirtatious with Mary's maid  you know when Mary accepts his proposal  her life will not be a happy one. Crichton hides his true feelings about Mary and when she is visited by an old friend who has defied her family married her chauffeur and lived to regret it  he impulsively asks Tweeny to marry him. They will leave service and sail for America where everyone is equal the last scene is particularly sweet as Crichton walks to a farmhouse after finishing ploughing for the day to find Tweeny waiting for him.I do agree I think the titles are profuse and flowery and excessive  they would do credit to a William S. Hart western!!! I also think Thomas Meighan was born for this role  he was manly and masterful. He was also excellent in Why Change Your Wife?  Cecil B. DeMille obviously liked him a lot as he popped up in quite a few of his movies. Although Barrie had considered ending his play with Crichton and Mary continuing their affair even after Lady Mary is married he decided on a more conventional ending as he thought the stalls wouldn't like it!!!Highly Highly Recommended.".

	schema:headline " Sort of like what you'd have if Sherwood Schwartz and Lina Wertmller had a love child...";
	schema:reviewBody "I am sure my summary got your attention but this really is accurate. This J.M. Barrie play that was brought to the screen by Cecil B. DeMille is an awful lot like Sherwood Schwartz's Gilligan's Island merged with Lina Wertmller's Swept Away...seriously! And it just goes to show you that these more moderns tales aren't as original as you might have thought.Let's back up a bit. Swept Away is a film that satirizes social class. A very demanding and selfish rich snob is knocked overboard from a yacht. A crew member who she'd treated like dirt is also in same predicament. Eventually the two find themselves on a deserted island and she expects the same social class distinctions to continue. However he's sick of her bellyaching and unwillingness to work so eventually the much stronger and more capable man beats the snot out of the womanteaching her that he is now boss. Oddly over time they fall in love and the film becomes quite sexual.Well Male and Female is based on J.M. Barrie's The Admiral Crichton. In this version the story is almost the same except that instead of one snobby lady a group of snobs as well as a very snobby lady are stuck on an island with two servants. The same situation results MINUS all the sex in the Lina Wertmller film. Plus unfortunately DeMille handles Male and Female in a very very heavyhanded mannerinfusing the story with a very very very preachy narration and meaningless Babylonian scenes that were clearly influenced by D.W. Griffith's Intollerance.For a 1919 film you have to cut it some slack when it comes to rating it. Yes it is very preachy and obvious and the intertitle cards are awfully written but the basic story is excellent and it's a whole lot better than most fulllength films you see from the same time period. Well worth seeing.".

	onyx:emotionText "I am sure my summary got your attention but this really is accurate. This J.M. Barrie play that was brought to the screen by Cecil B. DeMille is an awful lot like Sherwood Schwartz's Gilligan's Island merged with Lina Wertmller's Swept Away...seriously! And it just goes to show you that these more moderns tales aren't as original as you might have thought.Let's back up a bit. Swept Away is a film that satirizes social class. A very demanding and selfish rich snob is knocked overboard from a yacht. A crew member who she'd treated like dirt is also in same predicament. Eventually the two find themselves on a deserted island and she expects the same social class distinctions to continue. However he's sick of her bellyaching and unwillingness to work so eventually the much stronger and more capable man beats the snot out of the womanteaching her that he is now boss. Oddly over time they fall in love and the film becomes quite sexual.Well Male and Female is based on J.M. Barrie's The Admiral Crichton. In this version the story is almost the same except that instead of one snobby lady a group of snobs as well as a very snobby lady are stuck on an island with two servants. The same situation results MINUS all the sex in the Lina Wertmller film. Plus unfortunately DeMille handles Male and Female in a very very heavyhanded mannerinfusing the story with a very very very preachy narration and meaningless Babylonian scenes that were clearly influenced by D.W. Griffith's Intollerance.For a 1919 film you have to cut it some slack when it comes to rating it. Yes it is very preachy and obvious and the intertitle cards are awfully written but the basic story is excellent and it's a whole lot better than most fulllength films you see from the same time period. Well worth seeing.";

In the meantime he has big dreams to pursue on Earth such as landing a slot at the final Amateur Night Contest at the famed Apollo Theatre. Lance's has one little problem though  he isn't that funny. Thanks to an overly cautious emissary from heaven Mr. Keyes Eugene Levy he's going to get hit literally with a much bigger problem. Showing that even God has difficulty finding good help these days the inept minion mistakenly plucks Lance from a traffic accident  before it takes place.

In the Beatty version the protagonist was a backup quarterback for the thenLos Angeles Rams. In Rock's hipper version our lead character is a struggling young  and decidedly lowtalent  standup comedian.It's very funny to see the razorsharp Rock playing a bad comedian. It's kind of like seeing Tom Hanks play a bad actor. Lance Barton's dream is to play the legendary Apollo Theater on a nonamateur night. But every time he tries out his material he's booed off the stage lustily  so much so that his nickname becomes Booie. His jokes are lame his delivery painful. In short Lance is everything that the real Chris Rock isn't.Lance is also a bike messenger and he's riding the streets on his way to try out even more material when BAM! He's hit by a truck. Ok so maybe he was taken from his body a tenth of a second early by a slightly incompetent angel Eugene Levy but hey he was going to get hit anyway. No dice it appears Lance isn't due in Heaven until 2044. So what to do? Mr. King Chazz Palminteri the manager of Heaven reluctantly agrees to find a new body for the notquitedead Mr. Barton. Trouble is the body they find is of a greedy old white man. Turns out this fella a Mr. Wellington owns all kinds of things  he's the 15th richest man in the country! What luck! You can imagine how Lance will turn things around. But of course while in the body of the affluent Mr. Wellington Lance falls for a gorgeous hospital worker Regina King. We males know how tough it is to find a female given our own body but try winning one over while you're an dumpy old white guy! And it's even worse when she's not impressed by your money.  This is Rock's first shot at a lead role and in my opinion he performs admirably. There's still a lot of the standup comedian in him  and of course if he ever wants to get diverse roles he might have to stop incorporating standup routines into the script  but this isn't really a bad thing. Rock's personality  his drive his delivery his demeanor and his passion  are what fuel this film. He's clearly having a lot of fun in the role and he seems bent on making sure you have fun watching him.".

He is supposed to be playing a unfunny Black comedian reincarnated back into a white businessman who has just been bumped off by his wife and assistant. Even in a comedy you have to bring some sense of reality to make the humor work. His character doesn't change he continues to act like a black guy and not just any one but himself Lance. Of course that's what you'd doyour given a second chance for no good reason other than heaven making an administrative error and you use that most precious gift to continue acting in the same dumb way you did before. Why does heaven give him a second chance other than the weak plot demands it? Lance doesn't do anything special to deserve it in his previous life he just seems to take it for granted he is entitled to it. He never listens to anyone else or any advice he just talks over everyone in his own self centered pursuit of a woman he glimpsed ten minutes ago.The point of view was all wrong if it was supposed to be funny seeing a middleaged white guy talking like a bad black comedian then that's what we should have seen on screen not Rock except in very brief flashes. The reincarnated Lance shows no sense of having gone through the biggest change anyone can make other than changing sex. There is no awareness of his situation at all. We are supposed to despise the ruthless business man but Rock is an equally irritating replacement character with a different but just as selfish moronic single mindedness in getting the girl. The idea of a young attractive black girl being genuinely in love with a paunchy balding and pretty ancient old man and kissing him passionately on screen would have just been stomach turning and I am at least glad Rock wouldn't let the cameras stray off him for that.Rock just didn't do anything to make it work. He created an unsympathetic selfish character who acted oblivious to his own situation and the reactions of everyone around him. But worse he just wasn't funny which let's face it most of us had gone to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chris Rock deserves better than he gives himself in Down To Earth. As directed by brothers Chris  Paul Weitz of American Pie fame this uninspired remake of Warren Beatty's 1978 fantasy Heaven Can Wait itself a rehash of 1941's Here Comes Mr. Jordan lacks the abrasively profane humor that won Chris Rock an Emmy for his first HBO special. Predictably he spouts swear words from A to Z but he consciously avoids the Fword. Anybody who saw this gifted AfricanAmerican comic in Lethal Weapon 4 Dogma or Nurse Betty knows he can elicit more laughter with the Fword than Martin Lawrence and Eddie Murphy put together. Sadly despite a few witty oneliners Down To Earth hits Rock bottom both as a contrived comedy and an improbable interracial romance.Down to Earth utterly destroys any good will that the Weitz Brothers generated with their landmark grossout face American Pie. This disposable drivel qualifies as a contrived as well as confusing comedy with a thoroughly improbable colorblind interracial romance. Unfortunately a more than competent castamong them The Full Monty's Mark Addy Chazz Palminteri of Analyze This SCTV's Eugene Levy and newcomer Brian Rhodes as Charles Wellington Jr.are wasted in flatfooted sketchy roles. Hardcore Rock fans will undoubtedly accuse their favorite comedian with trying to fix something that was never broken. Abysmally written by Lance Crouther Ali Le Roi Louis CK and Rock Down To Earth casts Chris as a messenger who rides a bike by day in the Big Apple and gets booed off the stage at night in Harlem's celebrated Apollo Theatre. Poor Lance Barton Chris Rock suffers from severe stage fright. Nevertheless his charitable manager Whitney Daniels Frankie Faison of Hannibal sticks with him through thick and thin. After Lance learns the Apollo Theatre will hold one final amateur night extravaganza he implores Whitney to get him in the lineup. Excuse me but if Lance is such a deadbeat standup comic why does the Apollo keep inviting him back? Meanwhile fate has something else in store for Lance. While pedaling home on his bike our protagonist spots a pretty lady Sontee Regina King of Jerry Maguire crossing the street but he doesn't see the bus that collides with him and kills him. Wham! Lance Barton levitates skyward with a halo wreathed around his head. In Heaven which resembles a cruise ship nightclub Lance learns that an overzealous angel Mr. Keyes Eugene Levy of Stay Tuned timed his death 40 years ahead of schedule.Heavenly honcho Mr. King Chazz Palminteri of Analyze This God's righthand guy apologizes and escorts Lance back to earth. The snag is Lance cannot reclaim his corpse so he must inhabit another body. The best that Mr. Keyes can come up with is ruthless white 60year old tycoon Charles Wellington. Wellington's adulterous wife Amber Jennifer Coolidge of American Pie and his unscrupulous personal aide Winston Greg Germann of Sweet November have just tried to poison him. Reluctantly before Wellington's body vanishes Lance accepts it conditionally as a loaner until Keyes can locate a more appropriate body. Meanwhile LanceasWellington encounters Sontee again. She is a nurse activist protesting his decision to privatize a Brooklyn community hospital that serves the poor. While Regina King brings a surfeit of charisma to her role as a crusading health care worker she plays a character who bypasses credible motivation in her affairs with Wellington. Although he is no longer black Lance not only tries to woo Sontee but also win a gig at the Apollo.Down To Earth features Rock in his most unfunny role. The comedian's reason for making this movie seems questionable. Reportedly he ate lunch with Warren Beatty and told Beatty that he loved the original script that scenarist Elaine May had penned for Beatty. Initially Beatty tried the racereversal gimmick himself in his own version by trying to cast Muhammad Ali in the title role of Heaven Can Wait. The deal fell through and Beatty headlined the movie himself. According to Rock his longtime cowriters and he thought that they could 'annihilate' this classic. Moreover he justified his choice of Heaven Can Wait based on his philosophy to Do Something you can only do when you're hot. Earlier Rock rejected a script about a busload of touring rappers because he saw little opportunity to stretch his image in such an outing. As a lifeless comedian in Down to Earth Rock doesn't so much stretch his image as he inverts it for the worst! This halfbaked concert film with an annoying plot does as much to cremate his comic reputation as it does the Weitz Brothers! You know a film about a comedian is in dire straits when a scene at the nightclub is played so you cannot hear the jokes only the laughter. Similarly the casting of Mark Addy as Wellington's butler who speaks the Queen's English but is in reality a commoner from Michigan defies logic too. Addy is an actual Englishman and he doesn't have to fake an accent his accent is genuine. The major overriding quandary with Down to Earth is the onagainoffagain lookalike switcheroo that the characters make so Chris Rock doesn't disappear completely from the sight for more than a few seconds. Although Chris spends half the movie as white guy Wellington audiences see him largely as Lance undercutting the comic irony of watching his stocky baldheaded Caucasian white alterego perform ghetto humor and chant derogatory hiphop lyrics. Incredibly Rock served doubleduty as the film's executive producer and one of its four scribes. The mystery is how such a wealth of talent could grind out such an awkward misguided muddle of a comedy. About the only redeeming feature of Down to Earth is Jamshied Sharifi's superb orchestral film score.".

Remake of Heaven Can Wait Chris Rock plays a struggling comedian who dreams of presenting an act at the Apollo nightclub.

Directors Chris and Paul Weitz previously made the much funnier American Pie but this garbage is a major step down and adds none of intelligence of their sexual high school romp. Their handling of the black man white man image of the hero is poorly portrayed. We are given glimpses of the white guy but he is never well established as a character. Rock is reciting his comedy act right from the standard setup right up to his eventual relationship with King. Her function is to be the love interest and nothing more. Chazz Palminteri and Eugene Levy are wasted in flat roles. Heavenly aspects fail because God doesn't make mistakes. No the mistakes are made by the filmmakers. Score 2  10".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is really awful. I first saw it in a theater when it was originally released during the big Chris Rock craze that was going on at the time. I was a big fan of his comedy and liked him a lot.I was very disappointed by this movie and wanted to walk out several times. It's bad for many reasons but the main one is that it's just not funny. This movie is supposed to be a comedy but there are very few jokes even in the scenes that contain standup. The makers of the movie also missed a lot of opportunities to add funny scenes. Throughout the majority of the film Chris Rock's character is dead and his soul is inside the body of an older white guy. Throughout these scenes we see Chris Rock and not the white guy which is fine but we should see the white guy a lot more especially since that's how everyone else sees him. We only see the way he looks physically a few times and only for a couple seconds each time. There is one scene where the main character is listening to a rap song and starts singing along to it. We see the white guy for a second and it's funny since you wouldn't expect to see someone like that singing along to rap right? But we see him so quickly that the joke isn't even given a chance to exist. The makers of the movie seem way too concerned with having Chris Rock on screen as much as possible.Then there's the ending. I don't want to give away too many details for those who haven't watched the movie but it's one of the weirdest and flatout disturbing endings to a movie that I've ever seen. I think viewers are supposed to be satisfied with it but I don't see how that's possible.I really don't understand how anyone can watch this movie and enjoy it. For anyone who is planning on watching it please don't. Unless you're one of those people who enjoys watching bad movies in order to make fun of them. In which case you'll definitely enjoy this one and you'll have plenty to make of fun of here.".

In Heaven Can Wait he was an American Football player. In Down to Earth he's a comedian. However being a comedian isn't so much what it rides on it's that he's black and this is what permeates the film.Hence a movie that's largely populated by humour that plays on the ohsofunny supposedly differences between white and black people and the culture clash as a black delivery driver takes the body of a rich white man. But for me the humour is very broad. Like a white businessman singing to black rap music  it's simplistic moderately amusing but really nothing special. Take this formula repeat it many times and that's this film.Everything else in the movie is put in but nothing gels. From the murderous lovers who just seem completely irrelevant to the movie to the nonentity that is Eugene Levy's character and we know this guy can do some great stuff with his material if he's given it.Then there was the obligatory romance. There were just so many pointed references as to how she liked his eyes and the person inside  making it quite clear that a hot strong woman couldn't like the old fat man that she was seeing. So the comments kept coming all too cutesey and clever a winkwink to the viewers at home. Her character was literally apologising to us for kissing him at times.The movie was very short too just an hour and fifteen minutes and all in all the movie just felt halfhearted. It had its small moments and for me Wanda Sykes stole the show not that there was a lot of show to steal. But all in all the movie wasn't anything special. I didn't hate it and you could watch worse things out there. But certainly you shouldn't feel the need to go out of your way to see it either.".

But the story takes a big nose dive with this recent remake which is more of a starring vehicle for Chris Rock than any attempt to do a decent remake of a good story. The supportting cast Regina King JERRY MAGUIRE Chaz Palmenteri A BRONX TALE and Eugene Levy AMERICAN PIE do their best to rise above this lameness but they're just reminders of their wasted talents. Another thing that pes me off about this movie is that the filmmakers had some idea that the average moviegoer is so stupid that they had to keep being reminded that Rock's soul is inhabited in the body of a middle aged white man by switching back and forth between the two. The makers of JORDAN and HEAVEN had enough confidence in the intelligence of the audience to not to have to explain that angle to them. Another point is with Rock who along with Pryor Carlin Foxx Cosby and Kennison is probably the best standup comic ever and has had a few good film moments NURSE BETTY NEW JACK CITY and I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA but this film doesn't help his case I know this movie made a lot of money. So what. I just hope his movie career doesn't go the same path as Adam Sandler another once funny person who now makes sucky movies.

Instead you just see Chris Rock being himself and people not understanding him.  There are maybe 2 scenes in the entire movie where they use their gimmick.  This should have been a lot better.";

Don't get me wrong Rock does all that he can with what's given him but it becomes another predictable comedy.  Would I recommend this to a friend?  Only if my friend is a big Chris Rock fan if not don't bother.".
