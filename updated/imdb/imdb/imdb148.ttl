Donny Osmond's character was so funny and I was glad my kids got a chance to see him since I was a big fan of him back in the '70's. The kids are big fans of Lucus Gabriel and Raven and I thought they gave great performances. Raven is such a talented person. I liked how her character in the movie was ambitious and determined to excel academically and still have friends and be pretty. We also enjoyed the scenes in the sorority with the stern Sorority supervisor. Nice to see all those college girls being supervised! And Grandma with her friends were big fun. The pig added a lot to the movie's fun and it was so cute. Although he did a fine job with the material Martin Lawrence was a bit wasted in this movie. The kids didn't notice cause they don't know how incredibly funny he can be. The overall best thing about this movie was the music. The music had us dancing in our theater seats we can't wait to get the sound track of this movie.".

It was actually really lovable and even though it was certainly mediocre most of the time and I felt as if at some parts they tried too hard to please the audience with mediocre jokes it was still very entertaining and contained a pretty good amount of laughable and that's laughable in the humorous way material.It was also nice seeing Raven Symone in this movie because I am always used to seeing her in what she's famous for That's So Raven and it was enlightening to know she played a role because I love her in that show. Also even though Martin Lawrence isn't one of the best actors and definitely isn't one of my favorites he's not a terrible one and if you ask me everyone in this movie could act well for their roles to some extent. There were scenes where I felt as if the antics were outdated and some lines were just not pulled off to the best of the casts' abilities but when it was over I ended up having fun with it and that's what it was meant to be in the first place.It was of course no masterpiece and it could have been handled a lot more professionally than it was but doesn't a ton of movies fall under those categories and yet many people enjoy them. Overall it was a good little movie that isn't as horrible as the rating and negative comments let on to be so if you're any bit interested in seeing this movie go ahead because it wasn't bad or disappointing at all.".

The interplay between Raven's character Melanie and her friends was right on. There is a scene where Melanie's Dad Lawrence and she are in the car and she is on her cell phone forever with their friends it is so true to life and you would only know that if you've experienced this.In terms of appropriateness for kids I can't think of anything in this movie that would offend. There is silly slapstick comedy that had adults and kids alike laughing. Kids who watched Raven on her Disney channel show loved watching her act in this movie. The Donny Osmond character was over the top and according to my 7 year old totally hilarious.Would I select this movie just for me? NO. But folks if you are looking for a movie for the family to see or something I could show a mixed age group this is great. I could pick apart little things about the movie but those parts of the movie I found to be silly or ridiculous were irrelevant to the kids. This movie both has a heart and is sweet in spirit. I wish more people would CONSIDER the AUDIENCE for whom the movie is intended when writing a review.".

Most of them focus on chasing boys. She is the positive role model parents pray for.My girlfriends and I love Martin Lawrence. The faces he pulls never get old. He's got charisma and as soon as he's on screen everyone is smiling. He's the kind of guy that lightens the mood and I know many many people who love seeing him on screen.

He's got charisma and as soon as he's on screen everyone is smiling. He's the kind of guy that lightens the mood and I know many many people who love seeing him on screen. How can you not like a guy that brings giggles with a gesture or funny face?If you have daughters take them to see this movie. It's a great kids movie.";

I love Raven in this she was the perfect pick! I can't imagine anyone else playing her character. Also Martin Lawrence's character isn't exactly how some dads are. But still he did a great job betraying an over protected police dad. And this is his first Grated film! Can you believe it? So anyways I loved this movie. Donny Osmand's character and his daughter are so annoying but that makes it even funnier! I loved it when at the end the daughter of Donny goes to the same college as Raven and they're neighbors! So funny. Loved the movie and the plot line wasn't the best. I know this won't be Golden Globe or Oscar worthy but it'll definitely be nominated the the Teen Choice awards andor at the MTV movies awards. If it doesn't get those nominations I'll be kind of surprised. Anyways if you want some good family fun go see this movie! It's worth it!".

	schema:reviewBody "College Road Trip was a pretty funny movie. It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be but it was funny enough. It was well made. In the beginning I thought it was going to be bad the way the first half started but then it got really good. There were also a ton of great messages in this movie. Im not a big fan of Raven Symone but she actually did a pretty good job for her first big movie hit. I find her very annoying and it seems like she never knows when to shut up. I thought that this was a very different movie for Martin Lawrence. Although it was a different type of movie for him he nailed the part. A bad thing about this movie was that it seemed like it copied of of a couple movies in several scenes. One of the movies were Penelope. The direction in this movie was fairly good. The message was about being able to let your kids grow up and having trust in them. This movie does show that life does go by really fast. That fact is true about life going by way to fast. So in that case you should spend more time with your kids and live life to the fullest. I didn't like Martin Lawrences wife in the movie that much. I thought that she did a good job despite me not liking her. They also found a mother that looked a little bit like Raven Symone which was smart. One of my favorite scenes in the movie was when the father and daughter went sky diving. It goes to show you that a father can get along with his daughter and have deep conversations. The person I saw this movie with teared a little bit at the end. So I guess it was like a little bit of a tear jerker to some people and maybe you to. This is a perfect movie for you to see to if you are going to college soon. It was more of a little kids type of movie but also the whole family can enjoy it to. It really gives you a good outlook of what college is going to be like. The story was also very cute. Overall this movie was pretty good and a very cute family movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have never seen a Martin Lawrence movie before and this movie did make me into a new fan. I have seen his material here and there but his material never has grabbed me. But today I went with my mother and my eightyearold niece to see College Road Trip. I fully expected to be disappointed but it turned out to be okay for me. Not the best and not the worst but entertaining here and there.The story goes that Raven Symone is Melanie who aspires to become a lawyer at Northwestern University in her hometown suburban Chicago but gets a letter of acceptance to Georgetown University in Washington D.C. Her three girlfriends are going and she wants to go to. But her father James Lawrence fears losing his little girl and wants to accompany her on the trip. Tagging along is her little brother Trey and their pet pig Albert who hide in the trunk the first quarter of the journey. That leaves behind Mom Michelle Kym Whitley.On the way they stop at Northwestern University and who do they run into  Donny Osmond as Doug Greenhut and Molly Ephraim as his daughter Wendy. Both have the same exact aspirations  She wants to go to Georgetown and he tags along with her. And when James and Melanie make pitstops Doug and Wendy end up at those same stops. Doug and Wendy's annoyingly overperky behavior and singing and dancing are the highlights of this movie. They are so loud they make James and Melanie cringe but they always pop up at the same stops. And when James' car breaks down they get into Doug and Wendy's truck. But my real favorite part is when they lose Doug and Wendy along the way get on a bus and get all the Asian tourists to sing and dance to Frankie Smith's 1981 hit Double Dutch Bus. As James and Melanie get closer they visit James' mother in Pittsburgh and James gets to come to terms with his long lost mother about letting go of children. Finally they sky dive all the way to Georgetown where who else Wendy becomes Melanie's roommate and then the two would head to Japan.Donny Osmond and the pig do take away from Martin Lawrence's and Raven Symone's performances. The pig is funny especially when Lawrence disguises him as a baby in a quaint hotel where no pets are allowed and then makes a big mess at a wedding taking place at that hotel. Osmond's preppy squeaky clean teen idol image is played to great exaggeration his character's wife and daughter add to the perkiness. But Martin Lawrence and his family are sadly undermined by Donny Osmond and the pig which is the film's major weakness. For 83 minutes it is not super slow it does go fast but there are bumps and curves along and then there is forced sentiment when Melanie finally gets to say goodbye to her parents amid the manic craziness. Martin Lawrence like many comedians of his generation who turn to movies is more of a comedian and less of an actor whose performances often resort to overacted slapstick.".

Martin Lawrence like many comedians of his generation who turn to movies is more of a comedian and less of an actor whose performances often resort to overacted slapstick.";

The leads Martin Lawrence and RavenSymone have a very nice chemistry together as do all of the cast! The movie contains clean humor and doesn't look to sex and violence to rake in money! It is a decent movie which is very much needed in the times of the blockbuster mad just to pull in cash! The major flaw in the movie is that it seemed incomplete and at the same time some scenes were unneeded! Again i urge you to ignore the critics and go see this. Oh and this has a B rating on yahoo! just throwing that in there lol! B7 out of ten".

Now that a lot of those dudes are attempting more serious films Lawrence has recently had two films released in close quarters the passable Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins and this abomination. Basically the film sees Lawrence ferry his daughter around the country in order to help her find the perfect college with several other family members and assorted characters lagging behind. All are suitably crazy in that stupid Hollywood way and Lawrence clearly sees himself as the star of this woeful effort gurning and overacting his way through as many scenes as possible. Bottom line....the man ain't funny!!! A film similar to this was made not that long ago with Cedric The Entertainer called Jonson Family Vacation. It wasn't great but at least it had a few chuckle worthy moments I don't think I was amused successfully once during College Road Trip bar by the sheer poverty of imagination displayed by it's clearly juvenile screenwriters. The director is Roger Kumble who made the excellent Cruel Intentions just short of 10 years ago and since has been gradually heading down hack road he may have made a half credible film with Just Friends but 2002's The Sweetest Thing was simply not acceptable. However this is a new nadir for the man I once thought was at least semitalented here he directs with a bland eye and is clearly not enthusiastic about the product. Basically he wanted a bit of cash and this was the best way to get it. Comically inept and at times completely unwatchable College Road Trip is as weak a comic effort as I expect 2008 theatres will have to show and should pop up quickly on DVD. It's an early but strong candidate for the years bottom 10 and may even be the ever irritating Lawrence's worst production to date. Sadly however one is almost certain it will enter the weekends top 5 and might even grab the coveted no.1 spot. Still when the reviews start flying it will drop fast like the dead weight it is. Avoid.".

	schema:reviewBody "Melanie Porter RavenSymone has finally come to lock horns with her father Martin Lawrence after growing up as Daddy's Little Girl. She wants to go to Georgetown University but he is way too overprotective and demands that she Northwestern University which is less than 30minutes from the family home.She plans a college road trip with two friends Brenda Song and Margo Harshman but good old daddy has plans for him to take her on the trip himself.Everything goes wrong for Melanie on the trip which includes her father recruiting fellow police officers to stage an outrageous scene to get her to go to Northwestern to her brainiac brother Eshaya Draper stowing away with the family pig in their father's police vehicle.Now the foursome have to get to Georgetown before Melanie's dreams come crashing to the ground.I have to say this is one of the most predictable movies I've seen in some time. You knew during the opening credits that there was going to be comedic bumps in the proverbial road with the two main characters fighting all the way until they bond again at the end of the film.I wasn't too impressed with the humor. Again due to the predictability of the movie. I probably laughed six times the entire movie. Most of the jokes you've seen in other movies and are done better in those movies. The gags were not set up well if you ask me and you knew the punchline was coming just as the comedic scenes were starting.I also did not like the performances of Donny Osmond and his onscreen daughter played by Molly Ephraim. There is such a thing as being too overthetop and they were. Personally I don't think either were happy with their roles as to me they seemed to have forced their performances a bit too much.On the other hand Martin and RavenSymone were pretty good together and did a fairly good job at being a comedy team  with her being the straight man to Martin as the comic. I've flipped passed RavenSymone's TV series when they are in the middle of a comedic moment. In the show she seems to be forcing herself at the comedy. Here she was more comfortable.The supporting cast was completely under used. It seemed to me that characters showed up when needed in the script. There was very little character development in these characters beyond of being told who they were and how they related to the main characters. Mostly the supporting cast were either used in comedic scenes or to set up plot twists.As for the soundtrack it's mostly wellknown tunes heard for decades sometimes in other movies and television shows. There isn't any of the major names from Disney like the Jonas Brothers or Miley Cyrus on the soundtrack. It's the original artists you hear like the Jackson 5. You also only get one original song in the movie sung onscreen by RavenSymone in a funny moment on a tour bus filled with karaokesinging Japanese tourists. The song itself was upbeat and is easy to dance to but you won't be singing it for weeks after.I couldn't really get into this movie thanks to it being so predictable. However there are a few good laughs and pretty good performances from RavenSymone and Martin which barely carry the movie. I would have to say save this one for a rainy day when there is nothing else on.".

The writing is abysmal of note are the endless babbling speeches by Lawrence preschool intelligence level gags stereotypical characterizations that went out with the dinosaurs and horribly executed slapstick scenes. The direction is zero it just poses Lawrence in your face like he's doing a standup routine while other nameless characters do a lousy job of trying to pretend they think he's funny. The amateurish cast's irritating overacting makes this cinematic flop even more torturous. The audience like the daughter character in the film will want to escape from Lawrence's manic ramblings as quickly as possible.

I saw a bunch of father's in the theater sitting with their daughters and really relating to Martin Lawrence's grief onscreen. You could tell they really empathized with the instinct to protect their children and the idea of them growing up too fast. The little boy and pig were really cute and a great addition to the story.

	schema:headline " Loud and annoying";
	schema:reviewBody "When his daughter is offered an interview at a college in Washington D.C overprotective father James Porter Martin Lawrence offers to drive his daughter from their hometown in Chicago to Washington D.C. Despite his goodintentions James' interference and overprotective nature turns this road trip into something of a nightmare.There have been many road trip films over the years all of varying quality but none that I've seen so far have managed to be quite as annoying as College Road Trip...The underlying base of the story isn't actually too bad an overprotective father struggling to let his child fly the nest and being unable to bear her being too far away from him. Deep deep down there is quite a sweet story here but unfortunately it's suffocated by a bunch of loud and annoying characters Donny Osmond and his daughter were the worst examples and are two of the most irritating characters that I've ever witnessed on film. It's almost as though the filmmakers genuinely believe that by putting a bunch of unbearably happy people on the screen that this will somehow make its audience happy but the truth is that a lot of these characters had the opposite effect on me none of them felt believable and the relentless cheeriness and stupid dialogue that many of the characters were given never felt believable and a lot of the time it made me feel as though I was watching caricatures rather than real people. The film does seem to have all the clichs in the book overprotective father weird kid rebellious teen who has awkward relationship with dad but whom inevitably bonds with dad et al. The problem with this film isn't necessarily its clichd approach but more to do with the fact that the filmmakers don't make any of the characters or the dialogue funny. Character development is also a bit hitandmiss for example the weird kid is just weird and given no real development and isn't funny.The performances if you can call them that aren't up to much I'm afraid  but that's mainly because many of the actors are either shouting or screaming at one another. When watching this film it often felt like it was trying too hard to be funny and the more it tried the worse it got.There are one or two nice moments between Lawrence and Symone which prevent it from getting the minimum score but other than that this is an unbearable unfunny loud and annoying film that would have greatly benefited from a less is more approach being employed.".

	onyx:emotionText "When his daughter is offered an interview at a college in Washington D.C overprotective father James Porter Martin Lawrence offers to drive his daughter from their hometown in Chicago to Washington D.C. Despite his goodintentions James' interference and overprotective nature turns this road trip into something of a nightmare.There have been many road trip films over the years all of varying quality but none that I've seen so far have managed to be quite as annoying as College Road Trip...The underlying base of the story isn't actually too bad an overprotective father struggling to let his child fly the nest and being unable to bear her being too far away from him. Deep deep down there is quite a sweet story here but unfortunately it's suffocated by a bunch of loud and annoying characters Donny Osmond and his daughter were the worst examples and are two of the most irritating characters that I've ever witnessed on film. It's almost as though the filmmakers genuinely believe that by putting a bunch of unbearably happy people on the screen that this will somehow make its audience happy but the truth is that a lot of these characters had the opposite effect on me none of them felt believable and the relentless cheeriness and stupid dialogue that many of the characters were given never felt believable and a lot of the time it made me feel as though I was watching caricatures rather than real people. The film does seem to have all the clichs in the book overprotective father weird kid rebellious teen who has awkward relationship with dad but whom inevitably bonds with dad et al.

But my boyfriend wanted to see College Road Trip so badly so it was his pick. We saw it tonite I have to say that actually with several exceptions this wasn't such a bad family film. As for me and my boyfriend alone to see it? No uh uh but I'm judging this as what it is meant to be a family film. I know that these Disney family films get a little old the story is played over a million times but I realized something the story is safe so naturally they'll play on it. So honestly it's not that big of a deal as for some of the jokes? Some were not that bad some were cute but some were just oh god Donny Osmond.Melanie is what you would call the perfect daughter perfect grades good morals great friends and has just got an interview with Georgetown University for acceptance. The problem? Her over protective and controlling father James doesn't want to let go of her so he tells her that they'll go on a college road trip and in the mean time he'll try to convince her to go to a school closer to home. But along the way he learns that maybe it's time to think of what she wants and to trust her.College Road Trip isn't a horrific film I wouldn't put this into the bottom 100 on IMDb believe me you could do so much worse when it comes to a Disney family film. I know a lot of people are giving this film a bad rep but honestly it's worth it for the kids. It's cute enough for the family has a good message and isn't all so bad. Honestly if it were not for Donny Osmond coming into the film and scaring 10 years off my life I would give it a higher rating but I think my rating is generous enough. For the family I recommend for an adult you might wanna avoid. I'll be having nightmares for a few days of Donny and his daughter singing.410".

What a mistake..Tere Naam was certainly one of the most enjoyable movies of recent times.. and I have gone from a Salman hater to Salman tolerator..SPOILERS.....What an unexpectedly amazing performance. Salman's portrayal of an emotionally tormented lover was without a doubt his best work thus far. There are certain scenes where his desperation pain and helplessness is almost palpable. He certainly seems to have tapped into some hitherto unseen reserves of acting talent to come up with his performance. Or maybe he just channeled the demons from his personal life. And the hair ah the hair.. I actually liked it  after I got over the initial annoyance. I think it is gutsy of Salman to actually look THAT different from his usual chocolate boy looks. It fit in with his rebellious good for nothing character.Bhoomika was a perfect foil for Salman. I could totally buy why Salman's character would fall for her.Her innocence and freshness is very appealing.The lead players had GREAT on screen chemistry.I think the friendship shown between Salman's group of friends was very real too.. nothing saccharine about it.I loved the story screenplay and direction. Definitely different.Add in the awesome soundtrack all in all 3 hours well spent.".

The film introduces Bhoomika Chawla who gives a solid performance in this movie  so solid that one would be surprised that she didn't achieve more after this film.

Salman Khan gives an excellent performance portraying the character Radhe Mohan who in the beginning is a rough menace and makes a transition into a caring loving person after he falls in love with the priests' daughter Nirjara. The only problem is that Nirjara fears Radhe because of his old habits. Being the priests' daughter she does not approve of his violent nature. With these twists and turns you are captivated into the story of two different worlds brought together by love. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes the mixture of music wonderful acting and of course love.".

As much as I hate Salman for all the crazy things he has done I must say he acted well in this movie.  I liked the different role of a complex character with an enormous ego falling in love with the submissive traditional girl.  However this unique and perhaps even disturbing relationship was never developed.  The story has a different ending keeping the tagline in mind.

	schema:reviewBody "Tere Naam is a remake of Tamil Movie 'Sethu'. This movie stars Salman Khan Radhe Bhumika Chawla Nirjara Sarfaraz Khan Aslam. I saw this movie when it was aired on TV. The first few minutes of the movie is just boring with over the top action a so called item song and typical Indian Drama horrible cinematography I expected this flick to be a Below Average Masala Movie. But soon this movie starts getting better. Overall the first half of the movie is decent or we can say Good. The second half brings an unexpected storm for the viewers or after such a decent first half I didn't expect such a brilliant second half. The story has pain which is enough to make you cry for all the people heartbroken by love this movie will play with the strings of your heart and leave you in tears. Performances  Salman Khan breathes fire in his role. Radhe's character has layers of Obsession Rowdiness Pain and Insanity and Salman nails all the layers. Salman was considered to be a below average actor with well toned muscles attractive attitude and amazing screen presence but Salman proves the haters wrong with this one. He is just amazing and now I consider him as an amazing actor. Bhumika Chawla is decent in Nirjara's role. Nothing extraordinary but nothing bad too Sarfaraz Khan plays his role well The Rest of the cast is goodMusic  Music of this movie is fabulous. Himesh Reshammiya does a fantastic job with the music. Udit Narayan is a legend and his voice is the heart of this Music Album. Sukhwinder Singh sings the very tough song 'Lagan Lagi' amazingly. Alka Yagnik is fab! Summary  This Movie is not for the weak hearted people. The First Few Minutes of the movie is boring and overall the first half is decent but it's worth the wait for the extraordinary second half. Salman delivers a spectacular performance. I loved this movie. I will give this 8 out of 10!Should you watch this? Yes! To witness some spectacular performance and an emotionally draining story! Don't forget to carry tissues and thank me later!".

Girls be forewarned if you dress provocatively you'll suffer the consequences especially if imprisoned mutants get loose. Hats off to Ulmer for efficiency  he filmed this enjoyable effort in a matter of weeks and he saved money on sets by using an exhibit of futuristic artanddesign at the 1959 Texas State Fair in Dallas.  The interior architecture is appealing despite being relatively simple.  The doors walls and pillars are all based on triangles and pyramids.    Don't' expect any elaborate special effects but the film does manage to invoke a pleasant Buck Rogers feeling. Unfortunately I've never seen this movie shown on local or cable TV and it  doesn't seem to be avail on VHS or DVD.  Dedicated scifi fans will have to work to get a peek at this lost gem.  But it's worth the effort if you're a 1950s scifi fan.".

	schema:headline " A Good 'Time Was Had";
	schema:reviewBody "Beyond the Time Barrier is an oldfashioned science fiction film made in 1960 that has the look and feel of a science fiction serial.  It has some obvious flaws most of which spring from its low budget.  The special effects are woefully unspecial.  The sets are cheaplooking as are the costumes and any makeup used.  Acting is mediocre at best with a few actors doing reasonable work.  Darlene Tompkins is a lovely actress and does a pretty good job in her role as a deaf princess.  Robert Clarke should be nicknamed Robert Stonewall Clarke for his stonelike performance.  His performance isn't wooden it's petrified.  Nonetheless he is fun to watch.

I found the story quite interesting despite not really believing the scientific aspects behind it.  Sure the film is talky but that was okay with me as I liked the story.  The film was directed by Edgar Ulmer and it has some wonderful Ulmer moments.  I particularly liked the way the mutants were locked up...a wellshot scene.  Also the climatic fight scenes were very good too. Ulmer uses a triangle of another scene interspersing into the already existing shot quite often as well for a neat little effect.  An interesting science fiction film with a message.".

	onyx:emotionText "Beyond the Time Barrier is an oldfashioned science fiction film made in 1960 that has the look and feel of a science fiction serial.  It has some obvious flaws most of which spring from its low budget.  The special effects are woefully unspecial.  The sets are cheaplooking as are the costumes and any makeup used.  Acting is mediocre at best with a few actors doing reasonable work.  Darlene Tompkins is a lovely actress and does a pretty good job in her role as a deaf princess.  Robert Clarke should be nicknamed Robert Stonewall Clarke for his stonelike performance.  His performance isn't wooden it's petrified.  Nonetheless he is fun to watch.

Clark is a Major in the Air Force and is flying a suborbital high altitude experimental flight. However something odd happens and he's somehow transported 64 years into the future! And unfortunately the future completely sucks! It seems some plague killed most of the folks on Earth and left most of the rest as either mutants or total jerks! So Clark has to somehow get back to his time to alert the folks on Earth. Can he do it? And is there any way they'll believe him? And will the complete and total jerks of the future even let him attempt this...after all they ARE jerks! Overall despite the crappy sets I could recommend this to lovers of cheesy scifi. That's because the basic story isn't bad at all and it ended very well. On the other hand be forewarnedit is cheapREALLY cheap. The worst are the 'mutants' kept in prison. The ones near the top of the steps and those down inside the pit are OBVIOUSLY from different moviesand look NOTHING like each other!! The stairs ones are guys no ladies? wearing the absolute worst skinhead wigs I've ever seen! They are hilariously dumb. But the folks living down in the pit look almost like extras from Island of Lost Soulsall covered in hair and looking a bit primordial!! Duh!

But I was somewhat surprised. While I would not call this a GREAT movie it is not without merit. For starters it runs at an acceptable length without one scene that is pointless. Though the movie could have spent more time at the start developing the character of the hero  we learn next to nothing about him before his travelling in time. While the movie is low budget the limited funds are generally spent well with some eyecatching sets and some wellchosen locations. The script has some interesting ideas here and there and it interestingly ends the movie on a note that's not completely happy  quite unlike most other scifi films of this period. Fans of 1950s low budget sci fi films will probably enjoy this the most. Others will probably find it a fairly painless way to pass 75 minutes.".

Yet while these people don't quite suffer from the full ravages of the plague the disease has rendered all of them deaf mute and completely sterile.

Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a decent science fiction film for the most part. Admittedly being produced in 1960 it lacks the special effects of movies made during the present time and the film lacked depth and substance to a certain degree as well.

The scene in which Robert Clarke observes the exterior of the futuristic city along with the pulsating solar energy tower is fascinating. I first saw this when I was ten years old and never forgot it. Also the scenes of Darlene Tomkins are also a delight for the eyes especially the swimming pool scene  I never forgot this either. I also liked the triangular designs.

For this the art designer for the movie Ernst Fegte should take a bow. However the overall plot is somewhat disappointing after Robert Clarke is captured. The idea that the human race can bring the earth to such a state in which it is perilous to walk the actual surface of the earth due to excessive radiation because the protective atmospheric screens had been decimated the ozone layer in the stratosphere for example seems very dreary indeed The scientist played by Istvan Bekassy mentions the ionosphere being contaminated by nuclear particles.

As the story progresses the plot becomes even more pessimistic with the sterility of the population the evil scientists the barbarity of the mutants the almost complete resignation to the eventual extinction of the human race as voiced by the Supreme Vladimir Sokoloff and the murder in the final reel of Trirene his daughter played by Darlene Tomkins. In general the writers could have done a lot better in terms of plot theme and characters.Not the best not the worst.Worth watching for the art design and certain aspects of the story which make a person think.610Dan Basinger".

The B actors all did a fine job but the real star is the script and storyline which I would classify as an A effort. A test pilot goes into the future by accident and arrives in the year 2024 not too far from now lol but in 1960 people were far more optimistic about space travel. They thought we would have colonies on the moon and Mars. Nope. We have chosen to wisely spend our money on national defense instead. I really liked the twist ending which I will not reveal. Well worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beyond the Time Barrier 1960 out of 4Scifi has a military test pilot Robert Clarke goes into flight during 1960 and moments later he lands his spaceship in a strange land. After walking around for a bit he's finally taken captive by a group of people who don't make much sense to him but before long he realizes that his little trip actually sent him through a time barrier and he landed sixtyfour years after taking off. The world has been destroyed due to a plague so he tries to get back in time to prevent it. This is an ultra lowbudget movie that has a few ideas going for it but unfortunately there's not too much that can be done in regards to the science fiction because the budget didn't allow for it. The future city looks just like any abandoned city of 1960 and there special effects just aren't all that convincing. Fans of Edgar G. Ulmer will probably say that his keen eye manages to take the low budget and do more with it than most would. I'll buy that to a certain level but there's still no question that the majority of the film is dialogue scenes that really just talk about stuff instead of us ever actually getting to see it. I thought Clarke was good in his leading role as the pilot turned hero. Clarke is always fun to see in these lowbudget movies and he does a nice job with the part. Darlene Tompkins plays the love interest a princess in the future and she too is good. Vladimir Sokoloff plays The Supreme and isn't too bad. Universal horror fans will be happy to see Jack Pearce's name pop up in the credits for the special effects. There's talk of mutants in the film but sadly those hoping to see the makeup legends work on them will be disappointed because they're just normal people in bald caps. Pearce does get to do a little makeup at the end but I won't reveal with what as it will give away a major plot twist. This twist is actually pretty good and I think the final fiveminutes are actually quite effective.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beyond the Time Barrier is the type of late 50searly 60s SciFi film of which you know after approximately five minutes already that it could have been a fantastic contemporary genre highlight if only the cast and crew didn't have to work with such a minimalist budget! Most of the conceptual ideas are really great and well elaborated but the cheap looking set pieces and the pitiable special effects have an immensely restraining impact on the overall plausibility and entertainment value. In case you serve an ambitious plot that is dealing with timetraveling and largely takes place in a futuristic dystopia you can't afford to use paper made spaceships or drawings of the metropolis and you most certainly cannot speak of horribly deformed mutants the entire time without properly showing their faces! So in an attempt to cover up for the budgetary weakness Edgar G. Ulmer does what every experienced veteran director would do replace the action sequences with endless intellectual speeches and complicated time warp theories as much as you can! In 1960 Major William Ellison has the honor and privilege to testfly a brand new and hitech type of army fighter plane. The speed of the aircraft is even a little too successful as Ellison breaks through the time barrier and ends up in the year 2024. It takes quite a while before our Major properly realizes that he fast forwarded 64 years into the future and the technical details are explained to him by three other scientists that went through the same experience. By the way I didn't understand one iota about those timetraveling theories but I also figure that incomprehensible speeches are a mandatory aspect of 50s SciFi Ellison immediately gets confronted with the terrible state of our planet and civilization in the year 2024. Apparently an all devastating kind of cosmic plague made the entire world population sterile the last child was born more 20 years ago and gradually transforms the remaining survivors into mutants. There's also good news however as the last fertile woman on earth is a beautiful princess and she has chosen him to repopulate the planet! She  Trirene  is a deafmute with telekinetic powers and she can read Ellison's thoughts which results in at least one unintentionally? hilarious sequence I know you can read my mind. Although right now I probably wished you couldn't and then he gets slapped in the face! Admittedly Beyond the Time Barrier principally got made to cash in on the tremendous success of H.G. Wells' The Time Machine and also borrows many elements from Fritz Lang's Metropolis but it's an engaging and occasionally suspenseful tale. I even like to think that some nifty ideas from this film were copied years later in massive Hollywood productions for example the sterility in Children of Men although I'm probably mistaken.".

	schema:reviewBody "Time travel is a subject which has been addressed occasionally in films with varying degrees of success.  For the most part these adventures usually entail journeying into Earth's imminent future and can provide an interesting basis for speculation of what might be in store for humanity. Probably the best cinematic examples of this brand of storytelling are George Pal's THE TIME MACHINE 1960 and Franklin J. Schaffner's PLANET OF THE APES 1968.With such an engaging title as BEYOND THE TIME BARRIER and the promising premise of an intrepid jet pilot traversing through the stratosphere with his supersonic aircraft into the farflung future 2024 one would expect to be in store for quite an experience.  However this film offers very little that is new from previous efforts like Edward Bernds's WORLD WITHOUT END 1956 and fails to be particularly memorable or provide any genuine excitement.This film's main weakness is its thin story line the pilot soars into the future is briefly taken prisoner by the existing society there and eventually escapes back to the present circa 1960 coupled with some ideas which have potential that is never successfully realized.  Considering how dialogue heavy this movie is it has a strange inarticulate quality.  Vague characters are introduced a trio of captive scientists designated as escapes from Earth colonies on neighbouring planets who also accidentally travelled through time and miraculously ended up in the precise same era as the jet pilot but the amount of exposition required to explain exactly who they are where they came from and their role in this society of tomorrow renders them virtually incoherent to the viewer.When the jet pilot resolves to return to the present to warn the authorities about the cosmic radiation plague which will ravage the Earth of 1971 due to a depletion of the planet's protective atmospheric layers eroded by constant atomic weaponry testing in traversing the time warp a second time he physically accelerates into an aged infirm yet he is still able to safely land his craft and recount his experience.  While the sight of our now withered and wrinkled hero has some shock value it really serves no purpose since the pilot's mind remains unimpaired and he is able to alert his superiors at the air base hospital of the impending calamity that awaits mankind.  Had he been unable to do so it would have effectively given some tragic irony to the story.The film's one bright moment occurs when the pilot after penetrating the barrier of time touches down his craft at the site of his former air base and explores the now bleak and desolate landscape only to find everything in ruins and in a state of total disuse.  Some effort is made to show the exterior of the futuristic city complex encountered by the pilot in a series of interesting drawings coupled with a superimposed animated glow effect and the surrealistic styling of the city complex's geometrically designed interiors have the proper outofthisworld look to them.  The sequences of the jet aircraft time travelling through the starfilled heavens are passable and Darrell Calker's competent orchestrations easily transcend this movie's shaky dramatics and ponderous events the music was designed to underscore.If seen as a curio of 1950's scifi cinema BEYOND THE TIME BARRIER might hold some interest for the inquisitive or have some special appeal for hard core devotees of director Edgar G. Ulmer's work but this misfire effort will doubtlessly leave the more objective and discerning viewer with complete indifference and boredom.  Had the script been more capably handled the result might have been some minor masterpiece and a more fitting epitaph to an underrated and much neglected talent.".

The sequences of the jet aircraft time travelling through the starfilled heavens are passable and Darrell Calker's competent orchestrations easily transcend this movie's shaky dramatics and ponderous events the music was designed to underscore.If seen as a curio of 1950's scifi cinema BEYOND THE TIME BARRIER might hold some interest for the inquisitive or have some special appeal for hard core devotees of director Edgar G. Ulmer's work but this misfire effort will doubtlessly leave the more objective and discerning viewer with complete indifference and boredom.  Had the script been more capably handled the result might have been some minor masterpiece and a more fitting epitaph to an underrated and much neglected talent.";

	schema:reviewBody "After the release of 'Forbidden Planet' in 1956 and before the release of 'Planet of the Apes' in 1968 the overwhelming number of science fiction films were ultralow budget affairs generally produced to fill out doublebills at drivein theaters. I would posit that this period should be called the Golden Era of Schlock.Schlock Scifi was not all bad...in fact some of it was actually good and a lot of it is interesting and sometimes fascinating. There is a certain rough and ready charm to the earnestness and creativity of the actors writers and directors with some Schlock films being like the experience of watching community theater.This film contains creative usage of a derelict airfield filmed and edited to give the impression of a future of ruin and decay. The director also made good use of some strange architecture at the Texas State Fairgrounds allowing the audience to make believe they are in fact seeing the underground dwellings of the future.Stock footage of the F102 'Delta Dagger' fighter plane is used to represent an experimental rocket...and in an unusual move the director actually had a miniature created that matched the stock footage...the FX are extremely primitive even by 1960 standards but I have to give them credit for finding a model of an F102 because usually these films just show stock footage of say an A4 rocket and then a model of a B52 or something completely unrelated. BTW the F102 is what former president George Bush flew when he was in the 'Champagne Unit' of the Texas Air National Guard avoiding Viet Nam. There are some mildly scary screaming mutants here who for some reason the civilized people of the future keep in a huge dungeon inside their fortress as opposed to a safer location outside the city. The mutants are bald and wear coveralls in close ups and medium shots...but when the camera looks down the stairs into the dungeon the mutants have long hair and wear caveman clothes. Obviously director Ulmer obtained some stock footage of the cavemen types and edited in to save money and time. The mutants yell a lot.Robert Clarke is pretty decent as Our Hero the square jawed USAF pilot and Darlene Tompkins is strangely charming as Tirene the cute mute in the short skirt. In the city of the future everyone is sterile except for Tirene...until the arrival or Our Hero. The Supreme Leader of the City of the Future as well as Tirene want Our Hero to impregnate Tirene so as to perpetuate the human race.Apocalyptic Futures were in vogue during this era but this film is unusual in that rather than forecasting an atomic war it instead predicts Future Earth as a place where the atmosphere is gradually degraded from unrelenting atomic testing and the human race is decimated by a series of plagues.The idea of a time traveler visiting a postapocalyptic future was fairly new at this point. The George Pal adaptation of The Time Machine also released in 1960 touched on the subject but only in passing and was more concerned with evolutionary changes rather than nuclear holocaust. This film certainly beat the el cheapo 'Time Travelers' 1964 as well as the bigbudget 'Planet of the Apes' 1968 to the punch. Like those two films this one also has a shock ending. This film somehow manages to convey a mood of melancholy and anxiety appropriate for the story of a man who learns that his world is going to hell. The subplot regarding his role as a spermdonor admittedly an adolescent male fantasy is handled as plausibly as possible under the circumstances. Perhaps Gene Roddenberry was influenced by this film since his 1964 unsold Star Trek pilot is also a story of a sciencefiction sperm donor.Many reviewers like to discuss ne'erdowell director Edgar Ulmer's style in this film. Certainly there are some elements of 1920's German expressionism that help this film be a little more creepy and moody than it would otherwise.In summary this is a fun and interesting excursion into the land of Schlock and it is better and more interesting than most Schlock...yet it was created as Schlock and Schlock it will always be. View it in this context and you will be happy.".

	schema:headline " It's the Music which Makes this Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "It doesn't really matter when pondering the origins of artistic creative genius when you have the privilege of actually hearing it and it doesn't come much better than listening to Richard Rodney Bennet's musical score to this film. I watched the VHS version which unfortunately is still the only one available last winter and was struck by the film's musical message and subject content. It also doesn't really matter if historical accuracy is somewhat shrouded by other matters considered more important such as the core or center of the soul which was the essence of Caroline Lamb's relationship with Byron and which caused her life to break down into hopeless violence and chaos it'll end badly according to her husband's accurate prediction. This is what Bolt wanted to portray and did so successfully much like his portrayal of Thomas More in 'A Man For All Seasons.' Of course the film isn't without flaws  very few are. Sarah Miles was probably more successfully cast in films such as 'Those Magnificent men in Their Flying Machines' or 'Ryan's Daughter.' But a historical Lady Caroline is probably difficult to act. Margaret Leighton did a much better job portraying a shrewish hardnosed Lady Melbourne. You couldn't in those days go beyond being a little shady right to her ignorant inexpressive and unmoved response to Caroline's bizarre 'wild' death from a broken heart My god... wouldn't she! All she ever cared about was her son's political status and ambition no less than her own reputation. It's perhaps ironic that these two actresses played opposite each other in a contemporary version of 'Great Expectations' when Leighton as Miss Havisham regrets rearing a heart of stone Estella. The death scene is almost reminiscent of dark and stormy parallel film genre situations such as Susannah York's wandering around the Yorkshire Moors in an adaptation of Jane Eyre and Anna Calder Marshall's performance as the ghost of a dead Catherine Earnshaw in a 70's adaptation of Wuthering Heights. Byron and Heathcliff are rocks on which their heroines dash themselves against. There are other examples of 19th Century tragic women caught in wind or rain such as Hardy's 'Far From the Madding Crowd' and for which Bennet also wrote the film score. But to top it all it's the music that shines forth right from the striking opening hearing the symbol percussion instrument when the film's title appears on the screen like switching on a light and is much better in the original widescreen format to the solo violin elegy and closing credits. Miles galloping across the moors is incurably and slaveringly romantic like the romance of the times enhancing the passion wildness eagerness an unquenchable flame in this music. Being rich ravishing unquenchable insatiable I listen to it again and again and again. It's dramatic and overwhelming even haunting cold hollow. Enough said.".

In 1972 Bolt not only wrote but also directed Lady Caroline Lamb. It wasn't really a success and as may be expected is a very literateminded costumer but also as may be expected is highly intelligent and very nicely played.It is of course an account for the most part of the title character's scandalous and disastrous affair with the mad bad and dangerous to know Lord Byron seen here as some kind of 19th century rock star. As Lady Caroline Sarah Miles is quite splendid she was of course Mrs Bolt I've always felt Miles was a much better actress than she was ever given credit for though her tremulous style wasn't to everyone's taste. As Byron a somewhat surprising Richard Chamberlain acquits himself somewhat surprisingly well while Jon Finch is more than adequate as Lady Caroline's husband. The supporting cast are made up mostly of the great and the good of the British acting establishment a superb Margaret Leighton John Mills Laurence Olivier as Wellington Ralph Richardson in an excellent cameo as King George IV Michael Wilding and the production overall is extremely handsome to look at. It's obvious on the whole no expense was spared. Indeed as historical dramas go this one is a cut above the rest with Bolt displaying a keen sense of the cinematic in several scenes.

	schema:reviewBody "On a day in 1812 following the publication of his poem 'Childe Harold's Pilgrimage' a certain George Gordon Byron awoke to find himself famous. This celebrity proved to be a poisoned chalice. A disastrous marriage together with accusations of incest and sodomy caused him to quit these shores four years later never to return.His brief but destructive affair with the already married Caroline Lamb is the centre piece of this film written and directed by Robert Bolt. The critical drubbing the film received deterred him from directing again which is a pity as he exhibits a sense of the visual and an eye for detail which is hardly surprising as he could not fail to have learned from the masters Lean and Zinnemann. Apparently Lean was offered the chance to direct but showed little interest.Bolt is wellserved here by the cinematography of Oswald Morris production design by Carmen Dillon and an excellent score by Richard Rodney Bennett.Unsatisfactory screen portrayals of Byron underline the near impossibility of capturing the complex contradictory and mercurial nature of one of our greatest poets but given the limited opportunities here American actor Richard Chamberlain does extremely well although one has to question Bolt's decision to dispense with Byron's club foot.I may be in the minority but I feel that the generally negative response to the performance of Bolt's wife Sarah Miles in the title role is unwarranted as she has captured well the character's obsessiveness and emotional instability. This instability was not exactly helped by an addiction to Laudanum which Bolt again has chosen to ignore. Byron wrote that Maidens like moths are ever caught by glare but one senses that her feelings for him ran far deeper than mere infatuation with fame.Not for the first time it is the actors of the 'Old School' that provide real substance including Laurence Olivier as Wellington Ralph Richardson as George 1V John Mills as Canning and especially Margaret Leighton who is gifted the best lines as Lady Melbourne. One of our classiest actresses whose performance is one of infinite subtlety and grace.This is a coproduction with Italy which explains the presence of Silvia Monti as Byron's future wife Annabella Milbanke. She looks ravishing but is totally miscast and needless to say is 'dubbed'.There are inaccuracies omissions and 'compromises' in this to be sure but that is the nature of biopics take them or leave them.".

Apparently Lean was offered the chance to direct but showed little interest.Bolt is wellserved here by the cinematography of Oswald Morris production design by Carmen Dillon and an excellent score by Richard Rodney Bennett.Unsatisfactory screen portrayals of Byron underline the near impossibility of capturing the complex contradictory and mercurial nature of one of our greatest poets but given the limited opportunities here American actor Richard Chamberlain does extremely well although one has to question Bolt's decision to dispense with Byron's club foot.I may be in the minority but I feel that the generally negative response to the performance of Bolt's wife Sarah Miles in the title role is unwarranted as she has captured well the character's obsessiveness and emotional instability. This instability was not exactly helped by an addiction to Laudanum which Bolt again has chosen to ignore. Byron wrote that Maidens like moths are ever caught by glare but one senses that her feelings for him ran far deeper than mere infatuation with fame.Not for the first time it is the actors of the 'Old School' that provide real substance including Laurence Olivier as Wellington Ralph Richardson as George 1V John Mills as Canning and especially Margaret Leighton who is gifted the best lines as Lady Melbourne. One of our classiest actresses whose performance is one of infinite subtlety and grace.This is a coproduction with Italy which explains the presence of Silvia Monti as Byron's future wife Annabella Milbanke. She looks ravishing but is totally miscast and needless to say is 'dubbed'.There are inaccuracies omissions and 'compromises' in this to be sure but that is the nature of biopics take them or leave them.";

Anyway two of these including the one under review had been very hard to come by though both were quite recently shown on Italian TV  and in fact came across my copy of LADY CAROLINE LAMB off You Tube which I looked for on a whim on the occasion of costar Richard Chamberlain's birthday! For the record the other titles I am referring to are THE GREAT WALTZ which still eludes me MAN OF LA MANCHA and POPE JOAN which has only been made available in a trimmed version and which I will be getting to presently in my Easter Epic marathonI have always enjoyed pictures dealing with historical figures but around the time this came out these had acquired a Revisionist outlook which often exposed the lessthanpleasant details of their private lives. Perhaps the first to do this had been Ken Russell via a number of irreverent madeforTV musical biopics throughout the 1960s but by the end of the decade his movie career had taken off in earnest  with THE MUSIC LOVERS starring the aforementioned Chamberlain as Tchaikovsky hitting the screens in 1971. Here then he is libertine poet Lord George Byron  first seen challenging a black man to a boxing match  who became the lover of the titular figure played by Sarah Miles while she was married to politician Sir William Lamb Jon Finch. While we are told that such affairs were common practice sometimes involving even royalty they were mostly kept discreet  a term which certainly cannot be applied to the one depicted in the film. Indeed the movie's low estimation in some critics' minds has much to do with its definite camp value Miles sporting shortcropped hair is tomboyish  never more so than when uninvited to a dinner honouring the Duke of Wellington Laurence Olivier due to her scandalous behaviour with Byron opting to escort another lady she adopts the garments of the torchcarrying lads ostentatiously accompanying his carriage around at night! worst of all however she attends a costume ball halfnaked and in blackface purporting to be Byron's negro slave!  it is here that the cracks in their relationship start to show as she is ignored by her partner and laughed at by her peers! Having mentioned Wellington it is also unbecoming to watch either the famed general or the celebrated thespian indulge in a onenight stand with Miles incidentally things would come to a head between Caroline often referred to merely as Caro! and Byron at the Duke's party where she attempts suicide!Finch an able orator in Parliament a protg of George Canning played by John Mills even if he stands on the opposite side in the House of Representatives obviously suffers on account of his wife's indiscretions indeed he is asked to choose between her and his career by none other than King George IV Ralph Richardson  who had once been his own mother's Margaret Leighton lover! The elder woman had always resented Miles and in fact her coldness results in Caroline going mad at the end. Notable bit players here include Peter Bull Pamela Brown and Michael Wilding the production values were certainly the best that money could buy the late cinematographer Oswald Morris art director Carmen Dillon and composer Richard Rodney Bennett who supplies the expected lush score.Incidentally this was awardwinning playwrightscriptwriter Bolt's sole directorial foray  which he created and personally nurtured so to speak as a vehicle for his reallife wife Miles. A coproduction between the U.K. and Italy it incorporated an irrelevant and fairly embarrassing scene set in the latter country as Miles and Finch go on a trip and decide to take a nightly stroll in a former gladiatorial arena  which is soon infested with wretched souls clamouring for money and grub what makes it so bad however is the fact that the extras were not locals since they speak in broken Italian even rendering impiccati  meaning hanged  as impiegati  workers! As I said then the print I watched  interrupted every once in a while by the wording PLAY and related video information  was not in the best of shapebut the film was nowhere near as unwatchable as I was led to believe if anything back in the day it had managed to score BAFTA nominations for Richardson Bennett and Dillon!".

William Lamb did not become Lord Melbourne till his Father's death in 1828 after Caroline had died Melbourne did not become Prime Minister till 1834again years after Lady Caroline died.The movie is available on YouTube and is worth spending the two hours it takes like I say I'm glad I didn't spend the 2 to see it in 1973.

The problem was that screenwriter Bolt was done wrong by director Bolt. Especially let down was Bolt's then wife Sarah Miles.Miles who when directed by David Lean in Ryan's Daughter turned in such a spirited performance was not given the same inspiration for Lady Caroline Lamb. Whatever else Caroline Lamb was she was not dull to be around. Miles does all right but the rest of the cast just seems to walk through the parts even the two guys playing the men in her life Richard Chamberlain as Lord Byron and Jon Finch as William Lamb the future Lord Melbourne and Prime Minister of Great Britain.I think these guys and the rest of the cast knew this was a vehicle for Miles the minute they walked on set and performed accordingly. Even Sir Laurence Olivier as the Duke of Wellington is strangely lifeless. Of course after seeing Christopher Plummer as the perfect Wellington in Waterloo I'm kind of spoiled.In real life Melbourne was hardly an injured party. He had a couple of other scandals attached to his name that had nothing to do with Lady Caroline. He never let the grass grow under his feet. Byron was notorious all over Europe for bedding everything in skirts within reach. It's likely he did want to call it a day with Caro but probably because she was crazier than him. Still the escapades of George and Caro titillated all of Georgian Great Britain but they don't move the audience a bit here.".

Miles does all right but the rest of the cast just seems to walk through the parts even the two guys playing the men in her life Richard Chamberlain as Lord Byron and Jon Finch as William Lamb the future Lord Melbourne and Prime Minister of Great Britain.I think these guys and the rest of the cast knew this was a vehicle for Miles the minute they walked on set and performed accordingly. Even Sir Laurence Olivier as the Duke of Wellington is strangely lifeless. Of course after seeing Christopher Plummer as the perfect Wellington in Waterloo I'm kind of spoiled.In real life Melbourne was hardly an injured party. He had a couple of other scandals attached to his name that had nothing to do with Lady Caroline. He never let the grass grow under his feet. Byron was notorious all over Europe for bedding everything in skirts within reach. It's likely he did want to call it a day with Caro but probably because she was crazier than him. Still the escapades of George and Caro titillated all of Georgian Great Britain but they don't move the audience a bit here.";

However until I saw Lady Caroline Lamb I had never thought her a truly terrible actress. I do now. In an unbecoming blonde wig and with weird drag queen makeup pencil thin eyebrows and pale pastel blue eyeshadow Miles is strangely reminiscent of a faded Danny La Rue. In fact Mr. La Rue might well have given a more nuanced and almost certainly more entertaining performance. The most astonishing thing about this film is that it was written specifically for Miles by her then husband Robert Bolt as a showcase for her talents. And to ensure success she was backed up by a supporting cast including the likes of Laurence Olivier John Mills and Ralph Richardson. Playing a smallish role is Margaret Leighton and she effortlessly steals the film. Leighton is sublime  a magnificent actress who commands attention and brings depth and meaning to her every line. Her genuine talent further exposes Miles as an amateur who is simply out of her depth. And as a delicious irony Robert Bolt has Leighton say of Miles to her screen husband Your wife is a mass of nothing. She has no centre nothing at all. Talk about art imitating life!".

	schema:reviewBody "Acres of widescreen that only seem to distance and diminish the drama with an overblown music score by Richard Rodney Bennett this film shows no real interest in the talented brilliant and finally halfmad Lady of the title either. She is portrayed as a ridiculous impulsive grotesque a childwoman although the Lady herself was a talented tragic misfit whose uncompromising individuality offended the hypocritically decadent high society into which she was born.It was only after Byron caddishly jilted her that she began to go to pieces. Unfortunately Bolt  as both writer and director  makes the fatal dramatic error of portraying her from the very outset as a mentally disturbed child she is shown in an early scene being medicated with opium by her mother which is made to appear a necessary medication to control her congenitally erratic and undisciplined behaviour. And Bolt the writer's portrait goes unchallenged by his wife Sarah Miles as Lady Caroline or by director Robert Bolt as the indulgent husband who makes a fool of her by mistaking scenerychewing overacting as a careerdefining performance 'both' these Robert Bolts conspire to create a ludicrous caricature of an immature idiot who would have repulsed the real Byron  bad and dangerous but not mad  from their first acquaintance. She comes across as just unhinged. There is no real character there to develop and no dramatic interest whatsoever in such a superficial and sensational presentation.There is no sign of the intelligent and cultured woman she actually was whose conversation and writing were informed by the literary movements of the time. There is no sign in her relationship with Richard Chamberlain's poseur poet of anything beyond a sort of schoolgirlish infatuation no different from any others in the mobs of squealing female fans that crowd around him. Yet she had already been the confident paramour of many eminent men. She did have 'anger management' problems but these arose from a strong character regularly beaten by her sadistic husband and disappointed and shamed by his own extramarital affairs. There are also more examples of this equally empty portrayal of husband Melbourne to be noted later. But in such a staggeringly stupid fantasy her rages appear merely the tantrums of a childish immature girl and do not seem to arise from any real sense of mature selfworth and injured pride. There is no great passion here only a mean and paltry puppet put on show  the unfortunate actress Sarah Miles manipulated by an ambitious husband who was unwisely wedded to the sort of grandiose pretensions that only his erstwhile filmmaking partner David Lean could get away with.The silly character as portrayed in the film is only besotted with the deplorably vulgar prettyboy Byron we are given here and is never allowed to confront and engage with the seductive challenge of his alter ego Childe Harold indeed when Byron is reading in public to an audience entirely composed of unaccompanied young women  surely an impossible scenario at that date?  the lush orchestral score intrudes actually substituting for the reading and making an irrelevance of Byron and his great work turning the poet into no more than a sex symbol for Caro to gaze at coweyed just the same as all the other dim 'groupies.' It is absurd seeing the great Byron declaiming his verses in this way with their enthralling words supposedly capturing Caro's devotion when the poet is reduced to only a pretty pouting pose and a mouth opening and shutting inarticulately like a fish in a bowl  all to the soaring strings of the orchestra! Bathos can go no further the film is an epic of bathos.Her longsuffering husband William Lamb is also ridiculously portrayed as a failed politician while in fact he twice became Prime Minister of Great Britain later in his career. He was also welleducated and would have well appreciated that Byron's work had a satiric vein that was modelled on the work of Alexander Pope yet is shown in one scene lecturing his wife on how radically opposed Byron's 'decadent' Romantic style was to Pope's Augustan wit and restraint in actuality he would have known that Byron's style was pithy and Classical in contrast to that of the actual 'Romantic' poets like Keats and Shelley. The real politician's fine Parliamentary speeches as spoken in one scene are not only irrelevant to the drama but impossible to imagine coming from the mind of the dullard Melbourne given us by Bolt. The real Melbourne's unsavoury side  as above mentioned  is also left out ensuring that this character is altogether bland trivial stupid and poorly realised. Melbourne was a far more intelligent and complex character than Bolt bothers to portray despite including too many irrelevant scenes showing his life in politics. An attempt to establish Caroline's own life in the literary circles of the time would have been far more apropos.And when at the beginning of the big romance between Caro and the idol she is shown kissing expressly because he hunts her down in the corridor scene during the ball when she leaves because she is fighting her instincts afraid of 'falling' in the eyes of her husband and society and because he is dangerous and transgressive and dominating this very much diminishes a character who in reality unashamedly 'stalked' Byron  in our terms  fully conscious and completely unconflicted in her motives. She is indeed shown pursuing him earlier disguised as a rather sexless boy but even these scenes are drained of the sort of necessary transgressive power seen in Visconti's Death in Venice. And all passion has already been exhausted by the aforementioned orchestral mooning at Byron posing Byronically while miming unheard poetry. Bolt's reversal of the powerplay between the two lovers fatally damages the strong and charismatic character which alone makes Lady Caroline an interesting person. It eviscerates the protofeminist and turns her into a ridiculous brittle period doll.There is no intense intimacy in this film  no spark of life. Everything is showy and overthetop and unreal. The script and direction is generally unfocused and splashy missing every target on the Panavision wall. There are overelaborated and irrelevant walkon cameos for bigname actors Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson. What a pity the roles of Melbourne and Byron were not built up instead and in such a way as to support the development of the titular heroine's role instead of competing for our attention. But all we get is more violins and tears and screaming and distracting extras milling around aimlessly in a widescreen wasteland.Lady Caroline's sudden death of a 'broken heart'  and out in a raging storm under the moon even!  is vulgar jejeune ridiculous tosh. Even when the 'pathetic fallacy' was an accepted metaphorical stroke it was never proposed that the protagonist could die of it! But here Bolt makes his inflated symbol the actual agency of his character's demise the whole creaking picture is a mechanical artifice cranked out by a talented scripwriter completely out of his depth in the director's chair and distracted from the extensive rewriting he would have had to do on one of David Lean's polished epics.The ugly reality of a bottle of sherry a day to drown the despair and disappointment of her life was an infinitely sadder and dramatic ending than this bathos. The unfairly and too often maligned Ken Russell's biopics actually never sink to such superficial disregard for their subjects. Nor for all their muchcriticised alleged excesses are Russell's films ever this lumpen and misshapen. Bolt's screenplay and direction are all over the place failing to focus sufficiently on the titular heroine except insofar as his poor wife's increasingly clownish makeup obtrudes upon our attention distracting us from taking the character seriously as any possible resemblance to a believable human being. Sarah Miles drops in the final death scene like a puppet. Bolt just lets go of the strings giving up at last on any semblance of a living person.He threw in the towel for good as a director as well leaving that arena more bruised and battered by the experience than his Byron was after his early bareknuckle fight against a professional bruiser. The poet is shown desperately ducking and diving to avoid being overwhelmed. Perhaps Bolt realised instinctively that he was himself way out of his depth Unluckily for him he didn't come out of the engagement with any more glory or profit than Byron. And worse he lost the girl  he and his leading lady divorced barely two years after the wheels came off this misfiring vehicle for her career.Even a child with a toy theatre of cutouts could have done no worse.Utter tosh.".

I could not help to compare this film to Martin Scorsese's Bringing out the dead. This film also describes the hard fastpaced life of two paramedics and their confrontations with pain suffering and death. To my own surprise I found this film better than Bringing out the dead because it was more human more realistic and more authentic. BOTD had this Hollywoodlike glitter and glamour to it that made it incredible over the top and to cool to be authentic. While this film is certainly not a masterpiece or some kind of mustsee it is a decent wellmade and gripping piece of cinema that is worth the watch in every sense.

	schema:reviewBody "Kammerflimmern or Ventricular Fibrilation the German title sounds nicer is a German movie from 2004 that runs for 100 minutes roughly and was written and directed by Hendrik Hlzemann. Actually with the exception of a short film later on and an upcoming project this is Hlzemann's only effort as director but he cowrote several other film also like the recent Martina Gedeck film Gleiendes Glck. But yeah like I said he has a film upcoming that he directed so maybe he is up for behindthecamera work again. Anyway back to this one here. It features two of Germany's most famous actors namely Matthias Schweighfer and Jessica Schwarz playing the main character Schweighfer probably even more main than Schwarz here. Other known names include Beglau Zech Spengler Noethen etc. And Florian Lukas is in it too and this film is right after his big success with Goodbye Lenin and again he plays a supporting character who is a friend to the protagonist and with the exception of small screen crime movies this is the niche he is still in today. Sadly in this one here he really plays a pretty poor man's version from his character on GBL only and I have serious doubts about his range.Back to Schweighfer I am not a fan of him at all and I think he is unbearably bad at times in his more recent works. So I was a bit surprised that he is doing a solid job in here especially early on. But the longer the film goes the weaker he becomes too. As for Jessica Schwarz I like her quite a bit usually but sadly the material she has here offers nothing between crying screaming and bleeding. Her character feels to me as if she has zero depth. Certainly a waste of a good actress. The film itself fits Schweighfer's description. It starts of pretty nicely with the scene at the Turkish family's home but the longer it goes the messier it becomes especially in the romance relationship aspect. There were many quotes in here where I felt that they weren't authentic at all. They were nothing the characters would say in that particular situation or in any other situation. One sex scene was an extremely blatant example of that. And storywise things aren't looking any brighter. The crash with the ambulance car at the very end was just the negative icing on the cake. Certainly not a tasty cake. More like a cake where there first 2 or 3 bites are still delicious but it does not stay that way and quickly changes for the worse. From a dramatic perspective the film cannot be taken seriously. For that it is just lacking too much in the realism department. That's also why my final verdict is a negative one here. the script sinks the movie. Don't watch.".

	schema:headline " View of an America Long Gone";
	schema:reviewBody "This wonderful film contains a warm nostalgic look back at the life of an ailing school teacher. As time and her illness progresses Miss Dove best known to the small town as a rigid and stiff disciplinarian realizes the positive effects she has had on the people around her and their love for her. Never married childless Miss Dove finds purpose and contentment in her duty  to repay her father's debt and thereby avoid a scandal by working as a teacher instead of marrying the man she loved.The film has especially fine direction performances and an intelligent multilayered script. While Miss Dove appears a onedimensional humorless snob at the beginning of the film the many layers of her story and personality are revealed throughout the course of the film. By the end you realize why everyone is so fond of her.Thinking back over this film I was struck by the image in my mind of an America that seems to no longer exist. Healthy proud and affluent small towns the belief in following one's duty in life instead of whims and the sense of personal responsibility among these characters are so unusual to see in a modern film  or modern life. There was a scene in which Miss Dove helped a bank avoid closing a selfless altruistic act that seemed so different than anything that could have occurred in the recent banking crisis.Growing up in the 1980s I think I was seeing the last of this generation fade away. Perhaps I still am. I remember writing a fan letter to Jennifer Jones years ago. I loved her then as I still do. I never considered it odd that she did not reply. She was a symbol of the grace and dignity of a long gone era. Noticing that she just passed away I can't help but feel she passed away with the unfortunate changing of our culture to the violent seedy and irresponsible. But what an enduring magical film legacy she left behind.".

	schema:headline " More psychology than sentimentalism to depict a wonderful woman";
	schema:reviewBody "Good morning Miss Dove was a major and pleasant surprise to me. I expected an over sentimental although wellmade movie. On the contrary I discovered that there is a subtext of sense of humor and the many psychological subtleties and finesses are even more relevant than sentimentalism. Of course I do not deny that I was deeply touched by this extraordinary wonderful woman Miss Dove. Miss Dove is the essence of the movie and even the sense of humor is based on her. Her pride her aloofness her deep conviction to be always right her refined elegant and slightly ironic way of talking that never weavers not even in dire straits make Miss Dove a comic character in some sense. And we see that she looks at her own overthetop strictness with a dose of selfirony.Miss Dove's mission as a teacher is based on a steel principle all her pupils are equal. Any partiality is just inconceivable. Actually she cannot help to have a particular love for some of them especially for Bill. When after his service in the Marine Corps the grownup Bill says to Miss Dove that he wants to use his saved money to complete his studies she plainly hides her inner joy. Why? Clear to show joy even much time after the schoolyears would mean to be partial toward her William a delightful even poetic subtlety is that Miss Dove never calls the kids by nickname. However at the hospital she finally affords herself to show a preference. She asks all her flowers to be distributed to the other patients and she just takes in her room the flowers sent by her beloved favorite son Bill. Miss Dove is a genius of psychology. The equalforall discipline is the canvas where she paints with masterly touches. She never preaches her own behavior shows the right way. When she sees that the little Jewish Maurice is illused by the other kids she doesn't utter a probably useless sermon on xenophobia. She just asks Maurice to accompany her helping to bring her books thus showing to everybody how much she cares for the little stranger. Then it's up to the kids to understand the lesson. This episode is related to a beautiful finesse of the movie. We see Mr. Levine Maurice's father terribly upset and worried at Miss Dove's illness. Thus we get that less fortunate than his son Mr. Levine has long experimented the horrors of antiSemitism in Europe. So he is fully aware of and grateful for Miss Dove's precious job even more than his son. Another great psychological job is the way Miss Dove talking with Bill praises Billie Jean's skills and humanity as a nurse. That's enough for Bill to learn the lesson that is to overcome his prejudices which coincide with her own prejudices so after all even Miss Dove has something to learn. Particularly poignant is the shy humble admiration and love paid by Billie Jean to her former teacher. That is mirrored by the nurse's naive attempts to imitate Miss Dove's elegant talk and perfect poise which give rise both to fun and to emotion.Some characters are conventional others are not fully convincing like that of the gangster Makepeace. However this guy is instrumental in showing that Miss Dove never condemns the human being. The film is permeated with positive messages patriotism dignity respect honor love for learning sense of community gratitude. I will be the very last to be displeased by that. Sometimes the sentimentalism is farfetched. I consider it a minor fault of the movie.Jennifer Jones as Miss Dove is just sensational. The remainder of the cast works very well especially Peggy Knudsen as Billie Jean in my opinion.Let me conclude remarking a great poetic image. The little girl from the top of the tree she has climbed a wonderful symbol of innocence and freedom stares with a stunned look at Miss Dove carried away by the priest and the doctor. What's up? The indestructible teacher has something wrong? Impossible...Like the people of Liberty Hill we all love Miss Dove this wonderful woman this mother of one thousand children. To enjoy this extraordinary character I strongly recommend Good morning Miss Dove.".

They were strict but memorable as is the case with 1955's Good Morning Miss Dove.A smalltown teacher who devoted her life to the education of children Jennifer Jones turned in an absolutely brilliant performance in the title role.Of course the town is unaware of Miss Dove's secret. As president of the bank her father embezzled funds. To avoid a scandal when the father dies suddenly Dove becomes a teacher to pay off the debt. Not only does she educate children in a stern way her relationship with the town is memorable. Her saving of the town bank during a run on it and her never ending criticism of people annoys many but it is realized that she has done such good.When she falls ill with a tumor at the base of the spine the town is in crisis. A former student played by Robert Stack operates.The effective use of flashback is well used in this picture. It shows the life of the teacher and the effects she had on this town. The cop who adores her her nurse who idolizes her a Broadway playwright who she guided when he was fresh out of Polandand a former student Freddie Makepiece a jailbird brings comic relief as well.Miss Dove deserved to be honored as teacher of the year in my book. The film deserves an accolade as well. The film is so good because it depicts what schools are supposed to be. To provide religious understanding and tolerance our heroine brings her class to a Friday eve Jewish Sabbath meal. s This fine film is a testament to inculcating our value system. Jennifer Jones was absolutely superb here in her treatment of the beloved strict but understanding Dove. In 1955 the same year this great film was made Jennifer Jones was Oscar nominated for Love is A Many Splendored Thing she should have been nominated for 'Dove' instead. The picture must also be valued for the cohesiveness among the people of the town. What fine support Jones received. Robert Stack is wonderful as the doctor her former student who operates on her as well as Peggy Knudsen a fine practical nurse who adores her and at the same time harbors a secret Chuck Connors as the police officer who Dove helped mold despite his poor background only to reject Knudsen when he discovers her secret. Kipp Hamilton costars as the future wife of Stack upset by a horrible experience she had openly pours out her heart to Dove in a verywell acted scene. Under the fine direction of Henry Koster Miss Dove succeeds because it's a slice out of Americana.".

To keep his good name she gives up the life she expected like George Bailey and in the process becomes the moral center of her small town.Her road was much harder than Jimmy Stewart's because Miss Dove never married she instead devoted her life to teaching history and geography and never getting to see the faraway places with strange sounding names that she only read about. That song could have been written for her. George Bailey did have Mary Bailey and the kids that was denied to Miss Dove.That's just one of the flashbacks in a film that has many.

Under a stern and crusty exterior Miss Dove reflects on the course of her life as a teacher when she is rushed to the hospital. Students come from everywhere to celebrate her and out of concern for her. It is the happy ending like that in Mr. Holland's Opus and the mixture of humor and gentle drama of Goodbye Mr. Chips revisited and done well. I hope that it will eventually be available on DVD.

	schema:reviewBody "A wellknown schoolteacher in a little American town is taken ill and this causes her to reflect on her life.  This unabashed 'weepie' from 20th Century Fox will catch you out unless you have a crisplylaundered hankie pinned to your lapel!Nine years after her sexkitten role in Lust In The Dust Jennifer Jones pulls off a tour de force as the prim Miss Dove. Henry Koster's direction plays it straight down the middle in this simple yarn of small town life.Liberty Hill we hear is a typical American town.  There are a hundred like it in which a sense of life's continuity hangs in the air.  It is not clear whether the narrator is describing Liberty Hill as 'snug' or 'smug' but it doesn't matter  both adjectives apply.  In Cedar Grove School a graduation ceremony is attended by parents who were themselves pupils here.  This is the deep complacent sleep of Eisenhower's America a world in which everybody has a preordained place and the doctor the policeman and the pastor are all expupils of Miss Dove.It is seemingly a day like any other.  Miss Dove is enforcing classroom discipline when she starts to fall ill.  Typically she instructs a child I am indisposed.  Mention this to noone.The stricken teacher looks back on her life in a series of reveries starting with her happy youth in the 1920's.  We see her as a beautiful vivacious young woman who shares her father's passion for geography.  The two plan an overseas vacation together ensconced in their improbably lavish parlour which is only slightly smaller than the Houston Astrodome.  It seems odd that Miss Dove's father should command such opulence and after his death certain banking irregularities come to light.  To prevent a slur on her father's memory Miss Dove undertakes to work to pay back the 'debt'.Miss Dove places duty before personal happiness declining Wolf Pendleton's offers of marriage and an expedition to the Himalayas because she must teach here in Liberty Hill.  The stiff correct character of Miss Dove is illustrated by the way she remains formal until Wolf has left then collapses in grief and coming out of her daydream composes herself as Doctor Tom Baker arrives.  Public displays of weakness just won't do.  It is not my custom to wobble.Tom Baker Robert Stack is of course an alumnus of Miss Dove.  The classroom undergoes minor changes over the years but the American kids keep being churned out like little Ford Thunderbirds.  China was coloured orange on the wall map ten years ago now it's purple the communist bloodbath? and Eisenhower's portrait has replaced Truman's.  But Miss Dove never alters.  She enumerates her symptoms to Doc Baker like a talking medical textbook and as she is carried to hospital she assures him You have defined my responsibility.  I shall keep my spine rigid.  Noone doubts that.We meet various expupils who have thrived under Miss Dove's tutelary genius.  Bill Holloway Chuck Connors was an impoverished kid whose true worth was recognised by Miss Dove   a child in whom the ethical instinct was as innate as breathing.  He adores his former teacher.  He is now a police officer.  Virginia was a pretty but confused youngster until a year ago when under Miss Dove's guidance she met and fell for Doc Baker.  She has found her vocation in motherhood.Maurice Levine and Fred Makepeace turn up.  Fred is now a gangster but he's an OK kind of guy.  He breaks out of prison to be with his teacher in her hour of need.  Thanks to Miss Dove his American morality is pristine When I hear some commie jerk belittling this country ...  Maurice first comes to Cedar Grove in the 1930's the wall portrait is Roosevelt.  He is a jewish child freshly escaped from Hitler's Germany and speaking no English.  Miss Dove protects him from Liberty Hill's ingrained xenophobia and nurtures his literary talent.  Singlehandedly she cures her class of antisemitism and Maurice goes on to become a Broadway playwright.This lady's influence reaches beyond the school gates.  Mr. Porter was the incoming Bank President who handled Miss Dove's father's indiscretion so unsympathetically.  Now he visits her in hospital an older humbler man. She's always been a stiffnecked termagant he says but confesses that he owes everything to her.  In the Depression she acted with courage and authority and averted a run on the Liberty Hill Bank.As for the film's weaknesses the script is cast in a quaint literary style which grates.  Nurse Green shows the cop into the room announcing Police Officer Holloway begs to intrude.  The sentimentality is laid on too thickly.  Doc Baker recounts how he survived shipwreck and thirst thanks to a shining vision of Miss Dove  She was right there with me all the time!  The hushed crowds on the hospital steps are 'over the top'.The establishing shot of the colonial church's spire repeated as the hours pass reinforces the film's themes of parochialism and continuity. Expupils donate blood symbolising their ties to Miss Dove and the reciprocity of the relationship.The sick woman contemplates death and concludes that whatever people may think her life has been happy.  The dreams of world travel were never realised but she knows the world through study.  Learning has compensated her for lost opportunities.  This is a metaphor for her having sacrificed love and a family.  Yet in the last 30 years every child in Liberty Hill has been 'hers'.  She has touched every young life. Kids? says Officer Holloway She has a thousand of 'em!".

This movie reminds me of Goodbye Mr. Chips which was good but I thought they could have done more in that movie to stress the point of all the good Mr. Chips the teacher did. Here they do just that via flashbacks which are highly entertaining and give good background to the storytelling. In a Twilight Zone episode titled The Changing of the Guard they also capture the theme of this movie quite well so if you like either example I gave you will love this movie as it takes its place among them. A couple of those flashbacks had me in tears as you realize that those people are you or someone you know who cannot only use a helping hand but also allow us all to contribute to a better world one person at a time. Who hasn't gotten to where they are today without help of some kind? Imagine if you turned that principal up a few notches. That's what is going on here only someone donates their life literally to the theme. Good investment by my tally. Good supporting cast too with familiar faces that became famous in their own time. The virtues acted out and displayed in this move are numerous. Humility sacrifice service hope charity unconditional love honesty and commitment all come on the screen throughout this movie and make their points. We are also reminded not to base everything we do solely on money outcomes but instead to invest in the bigger picture of life that build character and joins the everlasting properties into eternity. I am also reminded of the many who we don't hear about who stay in the shadows doing their share of good happy to do so and going unnoticed for it but perfectly content and satisfied. Why? The simplest answer is found in a well known scripture that keeps teaching us this principal When you did it to the least of them you did it to me. I know you. Come forward faithful steward. That's all that counts in the end is that you are recognized by the one who sent you here just for that purpose. Good movie to snack with plus a tasty drink Kleenex on standby and bring an open heart so your soul can be cleansed too. Enjoy! I did!".

	schema:reviewBody "Good Morning Miss Dove is a very episodic movie in which Jennifer Jones plays the title character a robot teacher. She clearly IS a robot as she talks with zero inflection and sounds about as human as Gort.When the film begins the 60something Miss Dove is teaching her students in a manner that is rigid and joyless. Soon she begins experiencing medical symptoms and she has one of her students fetch a doctor. Then throughout the film Miss Dove experiences a lot of flashbacksnot because of an illness or the ingestion of hallucinogens but because it's all supposed to be inspiring. The one I particularly liked was the first as it explained why Miss Dove went into teaching...though I would have preferred a flashback in which you saw her creator assembling her from vacuum tubes and bits of metal. If it sounds like I wasn't thrilled about the film you are right! There have been a lot of better films about dedicated teachers and Jones' performance was a HUGE deficit of the movie. She seemed almost inhuman and softening her character a bit so that she'd be less zombielike would have improved the picture considerably. It's a shame as some of the flashbacks are quite enjoyable and the film in not without merit. I liked the various supporting characters and their stories. My overall score is 5. If they had done something to humanize Miss Dove more and make her the least bit realistic they film could have earned a much higher score.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some reviewers characterize Jennifer Jones' Miss Dove as an aloof robot devoid of any humanity and unrealistic. It's certainly easy to agree with this point of view at the superficial level. Clearly one of her goals in life is to seem omnipotent in knowledge and graces and to instill this attitude in her students by example. But she is not quite unique in this respect. I had a high school teacher who closely resembled Jennifer's characterizations. She was universally respected by her students but also feared and hated by those not willing nor able to live up to her high standards. To those she was an unfeeling witch. I suspect that there were those students of Miss Dove who also fell into that category. Like Miss Dove this teacher was a spinster who had given up the possibility of an adventurous life with a suitor and the likelihood of children for a role she considered more important a chance to indoctrinate a lifetime of children with her knowledge love of knowledge and graces. At least outwardly she refused to have 'pet' students who took her goals seriously. Some came back many years later for advice.I wonder whether the name Dove is intended to have symbolic meaning? Doves in particular or sometimes other birds are often symbolic of certain attributes. Among the traditional possibilities are innocence gentleness peace freedom to fly wherevermostly via books in her case a link between heaven and earthas the Holy Spirit for example love and fidelity. Perhaps you can see several of these attributes applying to Miss Dove. One feature of the film you may find confusing is the frequent switching back and forth between the present and past. I counted 10 such incidents. Keeps you awake keeping up with the changes.The film climax occurs at the end when her former student Dr. Baker rushes in to her hospital room to tell that his wifealso a former student had just given birth to twins 2 more prospective students of Miss Dove. And oh yes her biopsy had just been reported as negative. Church bells through out the town clanged and a crowd had gathered under her window to wish her well the 'terrible' Miss Dove.".

Jones is seen in flashbacks going from 19 to 58 and it's surprising how she manages to go nearly 40 years keeping in character and stay true to who Miss Dove is.More a character study than a film with a serious linear plot this is Ms. Jones' film all the way and as aggravating as her character is with her business like attitude you can't help but identify with her. She sticks by her value of propriety and never slips from that. Yes she's a cold lady most of the time but underneath you know she only wants the best for each of these children and is always open to visits from old students who seem to confide in her their most intimate secrets. One of them is Robert Stack a hero returning from war her obvious pride and joy and now her doctor. Mary Wickes and Richard Deacon are a funny pair as fellow teachers enamored of each other. But this is all about Miss Dove and the little bits here and there about other characters often seems less than secondary.".

Of course you must not think too much. No psychiatrist would visit their patients at home and there is more that doesn't add up but never the less I was surprised with the end. People are getting killed and the killer is out there really close to the main character. You really don't know who did it all though you have your hunches. And that makes a thriller worth while I think. And about eroticism this film has stuff for him and her. Bruce really looks great in jeans and you get to see him naked here! And Jane March is stunning also naked. Beautiful sexscenes and nicely edited. The film has a nice chase too a Mercedes SL against a Camaro or Trans Am.Advice see this film and judge for yourself! and write it down here!

And that single if' makes all the difference in the world with regards to what finally winds up on the screen.When his treatment of a patient fails and ends tragically leaving him with some pronounced psychological damage of his own New York psychologist Dr. Bill Capa Bruce Willis quits his practice and goes to Los Angeles seeking the solace and perhaps the help of an old friend and colleague Dr. Bob Moore Scott Bakula.  Capa quickly discovers however that Moore is having problems of his own apparently stemming from a weekly group therapy session he has been conducting for some time.  Moore it seems has recently received some death threats which he believes are coming from one of the patients of this particular group though he hasn't a clue which one nor any proof of his suspicions.  Moore invites Capa to sit in on the next group session hoping for a fresh perspective and possibly some insights into the matter.  At the moment Capa feels incapable of actively engaging in the practice of his chosen field of endeavor but in light of the fact that he's Bob's house guest he acquiesces and agrees to observe the group.  But it proves to be an inauspicious proposition for all concerned and subsequent circumstances quickly put Capa at the center of just the kind of situation he left New York to avoid.  Once the hand is dealt however he has no choice but to play it out to the end.Rush began his career as a director with low budget exploitation films like Too Soon to Love' in 1960 and ten films later achieved legitimate status with the highly successful black comedy The Stunt Man' in 1980 for which he received an Oscar nomination along with his leading man Peter O'Toole. He did not direct again until this film some fourteen years later and during that hiatus Rush apparently lost whatever expertise he had accrued by 1980 and his roots' are clearly showing in this one.  The violence of the film is inherent in the story but Rush makes it unnecessarily graphic and while this could have been an incisive and insightful character study and intrinsically more interesting he takes the low road fleshing it out instead with scenes of gratuitous sex and nudity as well as superfluous action he works in no less than two ridiculous car chases one culminating in a vehicle being pushed from the top of a high rise parking garage. Furthermore he ignores motivations and character development almost entirely the two areas that required the most attention if this film was going to work at all.  Rush especially lets his actors down inasmuch as most of these characters presented real challenges that could have been met much more successfully with the help and guidance of the director.  Rush would have served his actors as well as himself better had he taken the time to explore these people being portrayed with some depth.  He apparently did not however and with one exception the performances by one and all suffer for it.      In 1994 Bruce Willis simply was not the accomplished actor he is today and he especially could have used some help in finding his character.  it was help he obviously did not get and his Capa ends up being too much John McClane and not enough Malcom Crowe.  Willis flounders between the two personalities creating a kind of schizophrenic characterization that seriously affects the credibility of his portrayal.  And it's the same fate suffered by Scott Bakula here.  Even in the scenes which places them in their professional' setting as psychoanalysts they are simply not convincing.Making the case of poor directing even stronger are the performances of Lesley Ann Warren Sondra Brad Dourif Clark Ruben Blades Lt. Martinez and Kevin J. O'Connor Casey.  Like Willis all of them seem to have trouble defining their individual characters vacillating between any number of personalities and unable to achieve that necessary final focus.  It's the kind of indecisiveness that is usually resolved during rehearsals but inexplicably made it to the screen here.  The single exception is the performance turned in by Lance Henriksen as Buck who unlike his costars somehow managed to find his character and make him convincing.The odd'woman'out of the entire bunch is Jane March who as Rose has perhaps the most challenging role of all and when given the opportunity actually displays some talent.  Unfortunately Rush for the most part uses her in a way that is demeaning and without merit and she becomes the object of a sleightofhand that is nothing more than a cheap trick Rush pulls out of his hat.  And by failing to use her in a more productive way by not concentrating on developing her character which is so vital to the story Rush commits his most critical error of all.   The supporting cast includes Eriq La Salle Detective Anderson Jeff Corey Ashland Kathleen Wilhoite Michelle Shirley Knight Edith Niedelmeyer John Bower Medical Examiner and Andrew Lowrey Dale Dexter.  The high note of this entire project was played before it ever even got off the ground that being the story itself but screenwriters Matthew Chapman and Billy Ray proceeded to methodically remove any and all credibility it may have initially contained and Rush took it from there taking Color of Night' straight into that black hole reserved for movies that fail to deliver on their promise.  It is not surprising that Rush has not directed a feature film since this one once the magic is lost it's hard to retrieve. 210.".

	schema:reviewBody "As I sit and recall all the idiocies of this film one of the most amusing that I remember is the idea put forth that a person with DID will disguise themselves to look like a different person when one of their alternates come out. In nearly eleven years of knowingly watching these patients switch from personality to personality I have yet to see this happen. This is before we even get into the fact that Jane March's behaviour during this film more closely resembles that of a person suffering mania  hypersexuality paranoia irrational fear and so forth.Bruce Willis must also be wondering why he signed up for this stinker. I'm sure the shooting script must have looked wonderful but a combination of extremely clumsy editing the sex scenes in the middle of the film are a wonderful example and poor character development turned this into another Plan 9 From Outer Space. To all of you who gave this turkey positive comments I ask you to ask yourselves what psychiatrist in their right mind would see patients in buildings where it is that easy for patients to off themselves? Especially in such a lawsuithappy society as America? What psychiatrist in their right mind stays back late in their office without carrying a firearm when they know someone is stalking them? Finally when was the last time you heard of a psychiatrist taking over a group of patients for a friend in the profession when one of them might have murdered him? Oh and a special note on Ruben Blades' role even beat police are not that ignorant about psychiatry an especially important element of their job considering how often they may be confronted by psych patients waving weapons in the middle of an episodic crisis.As a veteran of numerous therapy groups I could not stop laughing at this film. If it had been approached with the intention of making a comedy then it would have succeeded beyond all expectations. However the advertising campaign and the babbling tone of the dialogue left me with the general feeling that this film was taking itself WAY too seriously. If you do take yourself that seriously get a better script. If you have such a ridiculous script that will get laughed at by the 20 that will experience some form of psychiatric problem in their lifetime that's just a statistical fact based on reported cases... the real incidence may actually be higher don't take yourself so seriously. It's that simple.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film isn't nearly as bad as IMDb users made me think it was. Yes there were a couple of fairly ludicrous things late in the movie such as climbing the tower for no apparent reason but remember that character was a loon and especially the red Firebird on the top of the parking garage. I have an idea why these things were forced into the movie. Probably just because someone Rush? thought it would be cool to photograph. It's sort of like porn where the most common positions aren't done to reflect real life or because they are particularly erotic or even comfortable but because they provide the best camera angle. Aside from the last twenty minutes or so the film was pretty good. Jane March being naked a lot helped of course. It is odd that Willis' character didn't recognize her in her Bonnie persona while walking past her she didn't look that different. However I wouldn't have caught on that she was Richie also. NOTE This is NOT a spoiler because March is listed as all those characters in the cast list on IMDb which I saw before viewing the movie. The film has elements of many different genres and could be thought of as a psychological thriller an action movie a dreamy love story and a regular murder mystery. Bruce Willis turned in a good performance. As much as I try to dislike his smarmy perpetual smirk he has a certain charisma as an actor that I cannot deny. In spite of its flaws this film is worth a look. Grade B".

Richard Rush could have done better but the psychological film we see adds nothing to what has already been shown before.From the beginning we realize who the killer is as well as the person with the multiple personality problem. It's too obvious! The film relies heavily on the sexual attraction between Bill Capa and Rose. Much has been speculated in this forum about whether we are actually seeing Willis' willis or not. Since most male stars wouldn't be caught dead showing their genitals for obvious reasons what is seen for a second in the pool scene is that of a body double. On the other hand we see Jane March showing it all which is a welcome attraction.Only the final sequence has any impact. There are many things in the plot that don't add up and the viewer is ahead of the story at all times.Bruce Willis with a hairpiece looks good. Jane March has a better chance with the character she plays. Also Brad Dourif Lance Henriksen have their moments. The one that doesn't come across well is Ruben Blades an otherwise excellent actor trying to do a Columbo routine in this film.".

Support actors Pakula Warren Dourif and Blades murder lines from a script that should have never been considered for production. The plot roams swerves and bucks without making any sense at any point in the movie. None of the characters convince or connect and none of the dialogue moves or sparkles though Dourif does try. The Raspberries go to Willis and March though. Willis gets his for the worst scriptpicking of his career. And March for the mistake of thinking she's in a Playboy feature  though the camera work supports this misconception. These two are supposed to be young lovers but there is no recognizable chemistry whatsoever. Even the sex scenes are lame and unconvincing. Yes we get to see Willis's willy. And yes there isn't much of ms. March we don't get to see. But I've never seen two actors who looked less like they enjoyed making out and I've seen Attack of the Clones twice. If you're reading this trying to decide if you want to rent this movie just send me your five bucks. If you're deciding if you want to watch it on TV go to your bathroom and watch mould develop instead. You'll have a better time.".

In fact all of the characters as kooky as they may be are likable here leaving an impression after seeing this.There are very clever split screen shots using mirrors so that we can see both characters during conversations. The film is overdone though. It becomes a bit too heavyhanded near the end and then we are left with an overdub from one of the characters that seems silly. Also when we find out who the killer is the actor seems a little uncomfortable with his dialog.Not perfect by any means but very unique and very well shot. Almost feels like a Brian Depalma film.

In short my feeling was that all the characters were played well were believable and easy to connect with.Special kudos go to Jane March who is not only very beautiful and graceful in this role but pulls of a multiple personality role quite well in my opinion and is overall a pleasure to watch and this has nothing to do with the nude scenes which are just an added bonus for some of the audience...Finally I suspect this movie is so poorly rated in part because of the aforementioned nudity as I noticed a trend in this regard with all the puritans racing to give a rating of 110 to any movie containing nudity.".

	schema:reviewBody "I came across the Director's Cut version and popped it in expecting the cinematic quality based on the title starring actors and synopsis to be cheesy at best.For an early nineties mystery starring Bruce I thought this was a friggin excellent flick... and entirely watchable. The previous night I had popped in the more recent thriller Signs which stars another massive freshfaced cracker Mel Gibson a.k.a The Messiah and was so bored I passed out. I feel that this was due in large part to Signs' attempt at registering as respectable cinema... basically Shyamalan emulating his breakout hit The Sixth Sense another decent movie starring mr. willis...I thought that most of the characters in Color of Night were wellfleshedout no pun intended and likable. The patients' neuroses were a bit contrived but entertaining nonetheless... esp. Sondra's nymphomania and Clark's OCD.The important thing to realize here is that with a flick like Color of Night the primary reward is ENTERTAINMENT... nothing about it is really very thoughtprovoking which should be obvious from the getgo. I might not be blessed with a tuning fork for mysteries but I was in the dark as to who the killer was for a while and I found some of the plot twists surprising.The big sale comes of course with the tension between hot costars Big Bruce and the bucktoothed but beautiful Jane March... and the myriad sexual encounters which ensue. The kicker is of course the sexinthepool scene where we are first introduced to March's creamy goodness and gumdrop nipples and a few short glimpses of Bruce's engorged willis.The film is downright titillating... with basically every character boning the luscious Rose who it seemed to me was the obvious choice for killer extraordinaire. I think the ending will surprise all but the most vigilant viewers... plus the cars are cool Rose drives a tealandpink Geo Tracker for chrissakes the setting is so.cal. the breasts are bare tan lines on full display and lots of creative violence including but not limited to a rattlesnake in the mailbox... oh yeah and there's a cameo appearance by that one dude from Quantum Leap.Pop some popcorn and don't expect any Academy Awardcaliber acting!!".

New York Psychiatrist Willis he has acted better who drove a patient the great Kathleen Wilhotte to jump out a window has to get his mind back where guilt has surged through him. He takes a vacation flying to dunny L.A to stay at an old colleague's underused actor Bakula place. He's also a psychiatrist a more successful one thanks to a non fictional book he sold. He's pad is great. He also a short future as someone does him where Willis hit with a double whammy you could say takes over the group while being a prime suspect. I loved Ruben Blades in this as the cop one of the better if probably the best performances that alongside Henricksen who plays one of the patients who's carrying a lot of baggage. Now lets talk about the cooky larger than life patients. No lets not. Their just entertaining to watch. This movie really makes the patient group scenes fun one of the best things I like about this movie. Willis also strikes up a hot relationship with the so judged misjudged actress March. You'll see why in it's shock revelation at the end after all the nail gun shooting Owlll I felt that and before the end credits come running too fast up the screen. Off the beaten track like in other movies with the credits running some fast I don't know why they even bother. Back to the movie. Color Of Night is a fun treat yourself psychological thriller you'll never guess the killer unless your IQ is bloody high which I never at anytime got bored with. It's entertaining all the way through my favourite BW film. The sex scenes are great amidst some car chases one I absolutely loved the over the top violence highly approving plus the great co actors who give their patient's characters spark no more than great character actor Brad Douriff. These are the real actors but for god sake don't look overlook March in both her acting and her beauty.".

Yes I know the technology is out of date but other than 2001 A Space Odyssey what scifi film is not? The film is very intelligent. It allows the audience to discover things rather than hit them over the head. Its scares come from thinking about what is being presented not cheap shocks. That is not to say there are not shocking moments. When the scientists are executed the shock and revulsion the other characters feel is palpable. The character of Colossus is very well drawn. It thinks like a computer not a movie villain. Requiring that the bodies of its victims be left on display for example shows the kind of cold calculated thinking a machine would do. The film shows great subtlety in moments like the simple statement There is another system. It also does not resort to the obvious such as a romance between Forbin and his assistant. The people are too busy for such nonsense. The last moments of the film where the voice of World Control is intercut with the detonations of the warheads is gripping and powerful. The performance of Eric Braedon especially when he realizes the computer has been two steps ahead of him the whole time is outstanding. You can clearly see though the film does not put it into words that he feels the weight of every death his failures have caused. This is a powerful and frightening film. It is a must see for anyone interested in technology and its monstrous risks. On my baseball scale of movie ranking I call this a threerun homer.".

	schema:headline " Excellent SF drama";
	schema:reviewBody "SpoilersStill one of the few films to make computer science exciting The Forbin Project is an underrated and little seen science fiction treasure from the 1970s  very much a creation of its time but with a lot to say.The underrated Eric Braeden plays Dr Charles Forbin the cold creator of a giant computer which at the start is just assuming sole responsibility for the military defence of the USA. Colossus as this mega device is called is sealed within the Rocky Mountains. Once booted up it cannot be tampered with or overridden and offers such a deterrent that it puts the Pentagon in mothballs. To those familiar with the genre of course such arrangements invite disaster. As Forbin steps out of Colossus and into a meeting with the President a Kennedylike Gordon Pinsent his misplaced confidence in super technology invites a fall. Sure enough it is quickly revealed that the Soviets have their own version also just coming online called Guardian. Soon the two mighty brains are chums conversing in their own impenetrable language blackmailing their creators and revealing their dastardly plans for mankind...Joseph Sargent directed this as well as another notable film The Taking Of Pelham 123 1974 before disappearing off into television. By all accounts The Forbin Project intended in some way to capitalise on the recent success of 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968 was not a success at the box office  due perhaps to the bleak ending as well as the plot's relatively cerebral nature. Like Kubrick's masterpiece Sargant's film also features a deadly computer and is ultimately concerned with what makes men men. However unlike HAL Colossus is not malfunctioning it is programmed to end war and to make its own exponential judgements to further that aim being selfsufficient self protecting selfgenerating a mechanical genius which no human can touch. What Colossus offers mankind has none of HAL's selfcentredness more a ruthless determination to make us do what is better for all whether we like it or not. And where Kubrick's film suggests the reformation of a species though mindblowing optics and some enigmatic symbolism Forbin's project is one where ultimately it is one man who is 'reworked' not all  though the fate of millions remains in the balance.As Forbin emerges from the tomblike Colossus processing installation within the Rockies scenes vaguely reminiscent of the final sealing of the pyramid in Hawk's Land Of The Pharaohs 1955 we feel that he has leaving a part of himself behind. And as we learn more about our central character it is clear that in fact he lacks a good deal  most specifically any sign of real emotion. Forbin world expert on computer systems is as cold and as calm as the machines he idolises a characteristic emphasised by the excellent performance of Braeden. This aloofness is emphasised by the actor's slight German accent helped incidentally by the fact that he was obliged to redub his part after shooting had finished. By the end of the film he will be transformed by events he has initiated and Forbin's impending change gives the film added interest.Colossus' startling announcement that There is another system is what precipitates the main crisis a bald statement open to a number of intriguing interpretations. First and foremost the participants take it literally as the discovery of Guardian Colossus' Soviet equivalent. This film was made at the height of the Cold War which makes the relatively liberal treatment of the Russians struggling with their own dilemma as well as the cordial nature between the two heads of state slightly surprising. Apart from the abrupt elimination of their chief scientist and this ordered by Guardian the Russians emerge just as perplexed honest and concerned as the Americans. This reminds us that the 'other system' can also be taken as political rather than mechanical. It's the abrupt reminder of another social order announced aptly in midst of a smug Presidential reference to Roosevelt. Finally and most intriguing is what the Colossus' announcement slyly suggests in personal terms. As previously observed Forbin's own emotional 'system' is essentially passionless his surname even suggests that of Fortran a genuine computer language. By the end of the film the two super computers will have united using their own newly developed machine language to communicate. Moreover the world will be presumably united too by the dire threat facing it. And dominated by his creation Forbin will have rejoined humanity a process indicated through his increasing displays of belated emotion.Once Colossus and Guardian have joined forces they soon start making demands of the world enforcing orders by punitive missile launches. Mankind is forced to comply. Forbin as creator of Colossus is granted a unique status by the machine liaising between it and the world. But Colossus fears he may conspire so in scenes that recall those in Demon Seed 1977 the doctor is placed under 247 surveillance leading to the most interesting part of the film. For Forbin decides to convince the machine that he needs all human comforts to function properly  including time alone with a newly invented mistress fellow scientist Doctor Cleo Markham Susan Clarke. The plan is then to utilise their time together to plot. Forbin's sheepish admittal to the machine that he needs sex four times a week as well as his inevitable romance with his 'mistress' are the first real sign of his humanity. More amusingly the following dialogue ensues as the two are tucked up in bed together Dr Markham making her initial report the air filled with sexual static The hardware problem is negative... we are still studying a way to get into the thing. In a film singularly bereft of real humour this double entendre is particularly striking  and is in stark contrast to Forbin's previous concern to get his language exactly accurate for communicating with his machine properly. Meanwhile Colossus has become the first electronic peeping tom seemingly just as concerned with the love life of its creator as in world domination. Until Forbin's final shocking outburst of You Bastard! so is the viewer. This is when after bedding Dr Markham for real he throws a stool at a computer screen in a rage at Colossus' repressive agenda. It's confirmed then that he's finally rejoined the doomed? human race with a vengeance and has acquired traits of stubbornness and yes perhaps heroism along the way.The Forbin Project benefits greatly from a suitably cool style and restrained performances  entirely apt given the subject matter. It also has a standout score one that frequently mimics the clatter of electronic activity adding greatly to the atmosphere. As one would expect the computer hardware on show is dated no doubt most of Colossus' vaunted brain would fit in a hatbox these days but modern viewers used to the concepts of 'crossplatforming' the Internet and so on will find interesting echoes of these developments here. Add in an unfashionably downbeat ending as well as the working out of Forbin's folly and it emerges as considerably more than the SF curio one might expect.".

As Forbin steps out of Colossus and into a meeting with the President a Kennedylike Gordon Pinsent his misplaced confidence in super technology invites a fall. Sure enough it is quickly revealed that the Soviets have their own version also just coming online called Guardian. Soon the two mighty brains are chums conversing in their own impenetrable language blackmailing their creators and revealing their dastardly plans for mankind...Joseph Sargent directed this as well as another notable film The Taking Of Pelham 123 1974 before disappearing off into television. By all accounts The Forbin Project intended in some way to capitalise on the recent success of 2001 A Space Odyssey 1968 was not a success at the box office  due perhaps to the bleak ending as well as the plot's relatively cerebral nature. Like Kubrick's masterpiece Sargant's film also features a deadly computer and is ultimately concerned with what makes men men. However unlike HAL Colossus is not malfunctioning it is programmed to end war and to make its own exponential judgements to further that aim being selfsufficient self protecting selfgenerating a mechanical genius which no human can touch. What Colossus offers mankind has none of HAL's selfcentredness more a ruthless determination to make us do what is better for all whether we like it or not. And where Kubrick's film suggests the reformation of a species though mindblowing optics and some enigmatic symbolism Forbin's project is one where ultimately it is one man who is 'reworked' not all  though the fate of millions remains in the balance.As Forbin emerges from the tomblike Colossus processing installation within the Rockies scenes vaguely reminiscent of the final sealing of the pyramid in Hawk's Land Of The Pharaohs 1955 we feel that he has leaving a part of himself behind. And as we learn more about our central character it is clear that in fact he lacks a good deal  most specifically any sign of real emotion. Forbin world expert on computer systems is as cold and as calm as the machines he idolises a characteristic emphasised by the excellent performance of Braeden. This aloofness is emphasised by the actor's slight German accent helped incidentally by the fact that he was obliged to redub his part after shooting had finished. By the end of the film he will be transformed by events he has initiated and Forbin's impending change gives the film added interest.Colossus' startling announcement that There is another system is what precipitates the main crisis a bald statement open to a number of intriguing interpretations. First and foremost the participants take it literally as the discovery of Guardian Colossus' Soviet equivalent. This film was made at the height of the Cold War which makes the relatively liberal treatment of the Russians struggling with their own dilemma as well as the cordial nature between the two heads of state slightly surprising. Apart from the abrupt elimination of their chief scientist and this ordered by Guardian the Russians emerge just as perplexed honest and concerned as the Americans. This reminds us that the 'other system' can also be taken as political rather than mechanical. It's the abrupt reminder of another social order announced aptly in midst of a smug Presidential reference to Roosevelt. Finally and most intriguing is what the Colossus' announcement slyly suggests in personal terms. As previously observed Forbin's own emotional 'system' is essentially passionless his surname even suggests that of Fortran a genuine computer language. By the end of the film the two super computers will have united using their own newly developed machine language to communicate. Moreover the world will be presumably united too by the dire threat facing it. And dominated by his creation Forbin will have rejoined humanity a process indicated through his increasing displays of belated emotion.Once Colossus and Guardian have joined forces they soon start making demands of the world enforcing orders by punitive missile launches. Mankind is forced to comply. Forbin as creator of Colossus is granted a unique status by the machine liaising between it and the world. But Colossus fears he may conspire so in scenes that recall those in Demon Seed 1977 the doctor is placed under 247 surveillance leading to the most interesting part of the film. For Forbin decides to convince the machine that he needs all human comforts to function properly  including time alone with a newly invented mistress fellow scientist Doctor Cleo Markham Susan Clarke. The plan is then to utilise their time together to plot. Forbin's sheepish admittal to the machine that he needs sex four times a week as well as his inevitable romance with his 'mistress' are the first real sign of his humanity. More amusingly the following dialogue ensues as the two are tucked up in bed together Dr Markham making her initial report the air filled with sexual static The hardware problem is negative... we are still studying a way to get into the thing. In a film singularly bereft of real humour this double entendre is particularly striking  and is in stark contrast to Forbin's previous concern to get his language exactly accurate for communicating with his machine properly. Meanwhile Colossus has become the first electronic peeping tom seemingly just as concerned with the love life of its creator as in world domination. Until Forbin's final shocking outburst of You Bastard! so is the viewer. This is when after bedding Dr Markham for real he throws a stool at a computer screen in a rage at Colossus' repressive agenda. It's confirmed then that he's finally rejoined the doomed? human race with a vengeance and has acquired traits of stubbornness and yes perhaps heroism along the way.The Forbin Project benefits greatly from a suitably cool style and restrained performances  entirely apt given the subject matter. It also has a standout score one that frequently mimics the clatter of electronic activity adding greatly to the atmosphere. As one would expect the computer hardware on show is dated no doubt most of Colossus' vaunted brain would fit in a hatbox these days but modern viewers used to the concepts of 'crossplatforming' the Internet and so on will find interesting echoes of these developments here. Add in an unfashionably downbeat ending as well as the working out of Forbin's folly and it emerges as considerably more than the SF curio one might expect.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's interesting reading the comments of those who dislike this movie they either call it dated and so disregard it or ludicrous in that it could never happen that way they don't have to take the concept seriously and so aren't threatened by it. Well History is dated. That's why it's history. And we learn history supposedly so that we won't repeat the mistakes of the past I wonder if that's ever worked?. Science Fiction if done well is like watching future history. Star Wars begins with Long Long Ago... and yet the world it presented was thousands of years ahead of ours. Science Fiction's best use is often in producing cautionary tales so that We Don't Go There or at least make us think before we do. Yes the idea of a computer taking over the world through control of nuclear technology is ludicrous very ludicrous. Until it happens. Then it is already too late. That's the point of science fiction and other cautionary tales.So Collosus is about a dated computer that becomes sentient and starts asserting ruthless control for what it sees as the betterment of mankind. What does it matter if the technology is dated? Our technology will seem hopelessly dated 100 years from now. This movie is very much like Terry Gilliam's dark movie Brazil in a strange way. Gilliam has said his movie was a cautionary tale that the only escape from the world is in your imagination. Both movies make the same point that if a certain process government or technological is allowed to continue without safeguards we will reach a point where there is no escape. The time of quaint tales of Robin Hood and other rebels has passed No rebel band is going to stop it no revolution is going to succeed because the stranglehold granted by modern weapons is so pervasive we can't fight it without dying. So instead of relying on comicbook fantasies of fighting the Power we should make sure we never get to the point of no return. In this movie's case the fatal error was trusting in technology to run itself without understanding it or taking precautions to install safeguards of overriding its commands and shutting it down if necessary. In our country if our government suddenly decided to become a dictatorship there would be no revolution or rebellion. Our little handguns and rifles aren't going to match cluster bombs missiles and chemical weapons. We're at the mercy of our leaders and the chance for rebellion by force in countries around the world such as Zimbabwe has past. The cautionary tale that Collosus tells is very old and considered dated and clichd by many. And because of that its lesson is lost on those too clever to learn from it. Let's hope these people too clever to learn from dated clichs don't come into positions governing things like Collosus.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film is based on the 1966 novel Colossus The Forbin Project by British author Dennis Feltham Jones and was released in 1970 with a screenplay by James Bridges The Hitchcock Hour The China Syndrome White Hunter Black Heart among others.It starred Eric Braeden as Dr. Charles Forbin Susan Clark as Dr. Cleo Markham and Gordon Pinsent as The President.REVIEWAlthough the film begins slowly and isn't your typical allaction movie that people expect today it still a suspenseful and unnerving film which builds in intensity until one of the greatest climaxes in cinema history. The casting of the unknown Eric Braeden in his first leading actor role adds much to the power of the story. The acting is solid and the dialogue is concise so that there is nothing said that didn't need saying. Eric Braeden is convincing as Dr. Forbin and it his story that we follow and it is his character that has the most depth. His struggle to believe that his creation has become more than he imagined and his even bigger battle to try to defeat it are what really makes the film that much more believable. Susan Clark gives subtleness to the character of Dr. Cleo Markham. A woman who is as intelligent as any of her male colleagues if not smarter but who also has the emotional aptitude to help Dr. Forbin as his World begins to collapse around him. Gordon Pinsent portrayal of The President is very well executed. At the beginning of the film he is the supremely confident and affable CommanderinChief but as the story unfolds he becomes far less controlled as his power to control anything is gradually taken from him. It is the relationship between these three that keeps the suspense building to one of the greatest climaxes in movie history.The 'voice' of Colossus is provided by Paul Frees and it is this voice that although chilling also has a certain intelligence and possibly emotion. There are many supporting characters such as Dr. Kuprin the creator of Guardian played by Alex Rodine who is ultimately betrayed by his own creation. C.I.A. Director Grauber is wonderfully played by William Schallert who gives a performance that has now become synonymous with inept C.I.A. Directors.When the film was released in 1970 Universal found that they had a surprise hit on their hands as everyone clamoured to see it.Many of the Artificial Intelligence  supercomputer films that have been released in the last thirty years have borrowed if not downright stolen their ideas from what Colossus set out. Gene Roddenberry used the idea in the 1968 Star Trek episode 'The Ultimate Computer' while James Cameron cites Colossus as his inspiration for Skynet in his 1984 movie 'The Terminator'.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the things I really love about the scifi genre is that they can make very effective cautionaryhorror tales because despite presenting great possibilities they also show that there can be a flip side of the coin to them. To every decision there can also be dire consequences. This is an under the radar gem which I really like.I really like the plot line it was a film that was no doubt ahead of it's time though watching the film now is sort of like seeing a relic from a time capsule.In part of the 60's and 70's you have to realize computer technology and some of the concepts were starting to steadily rise the fact that these things could pass and access info let alone get certain things done quicker was amazing for it's time despite the fact none to few of us had access to this tech at the time. A.I. was a foreign concept as well and seemed like something that seemed almost millions of miles away. But of course when the 80's and so on hit and we began to have access to Computers and Internet and all kinds of technology like Cell Phones Survelence and Drones and has established A.I. the concept in this film is actually frighteningly placeable.I do like the suspense this film is sort of an espionage thriller only here instead of a foreign power it is against the power of a machine. And unfortunately unlike enemy agents or organizations whom can make mistakes this enemy doesn't make mistakes because it was built not do. Which in a way makes the conflict against Colosus extremely hard because it's literally almost like a war against God as this cyber entity has access to all kinds of surveillance so it knows most to all of your moves and due to it's unlimited intelligence it's capable of anything to everything. Eric Brayden is solid as Charles Forbin to me this is probably the best role from the actor and sadly only really big role as he never really got to be on the silver screen again which is sad because I really felt he had a lot of potential. His character is slightly sympathetic despite the fact that he created or helped create the A.I. he did it for good intentions to help create peace. But as an old saying goes the road to Hell is paved with good intentions and both he and all of mankind have just taken one big step. I do like seeing some emotion on his face despite keeping or trying to keep good composure he feels guilt knowing that instead of a great scientific achievement he made the greatest mistake of his life. So he tries to correct his mistake by trying to covertly sabotage his own creation.Colosus is a very interesting villain and is to me one of my favorite fictional villains and was no doubt a partial inspiration to Skynet from The Terminator. But unlike Skynet and many more A.I. villains this A.I. system operates on a gray area Colosus I don't feel is totally evil but it's not entirely good either this cyber entity is based on cold logic it carries out the necessary actions to produce the solutions to complex problems no matter the corrupt nature of those actions they are necessary evils to get results. It's goal isn't to eradicate mankind but to unify it in a way create a Utopia but like with all Utopian concepts there is a price to pay.I really love the voice that we hear near the end Colosus sounds like one of the Cylons from the 70's TV show Battlestar Galatica and this film was 8 to 9 years before that show. But the voice fits perfectly as it has that cold caluating menacing tone to it. Most of the things Colsus says about mankind really give a cold chill and are a bit disheartening because it's sadly the truth.I like the back and forth between both Forbin and Colosus to me that's what really drives the film. It's sort of a verbal chess game but unfortunately despite Forbin's great intelligence playing chess with Colossus is impossible as Colossus is millions of moves ahead. But also in a way you could say it's also the age old motifs of father and son mentor or student conflict as we see both old wisdom conflict against advanced intelligence.Thought this film isn't perfect it has a couple of bugs in it's system that hold it back for me. The pacing is kinda slow which is one of the reasons it takes a while for things to get going. Also it's not really that exciting it just feels like the anty needed to be upped a little more or a sticky situation or two needed to occur to keep things moving. But those are things I can get around.The ending is to me one of the darkest one's I've seen which will haunt you I won't say what it is but I leave it with these words to one side came great triumph but to another came great tragedy. The message of the film is simply don't let technology rule your lives. Technological advance and the use of it is OK as long as it's used wisely and it's sole purpose is as a tool and not the single solution to everything. But also about the danger of progress just because we can do a thing doesn't necessarily mean that we should.I personally wouldn't mind a remake a good one mind you and from an film that old enough and if they do may'be they can do it based on the whole trilogy of books that would be an interesting scifi saga.The numbers the machines computed may'be our last days.Rating 3 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "In the unstable world of governments there is nothing more frightening than the Doomday war. Generals and scientists alike predict that will be World War Three. To that end COLOSSUS THE FORBIN PROJECT was created. The film encapsulates the drama which unfolds immediately upon the completion of an atomic powered computer. In essence the greatest scientific minds of the world headed by none other than Dr. Charles Forbin Eric Braeden have combined their considerable talents to create the worlds' most advance machine which has but one purpose To insure the Peaceful CoExistence of the world's population. The film contains an extremely memorable line spoken by Dr. Forbin which comes to haunt him. Frankenstein should be required reading of all scientists. With the considerable talents of Gordon Pinsent as The President of the United States Leonid Rostoff as the Russian Premiere Susan Clark as Dr. Cleo Markham and William Schallert as CIA Director Grauber the dream of war weary officials to finally create the ultimate defense machine comes true. What everyone forgot was the fact a machine created to prevent war could morph into an atomic tyrant. Given the power to destroy the planet and the peoples it was meant to safeguard now threatens all with a maxim I was created to prevent war.

To that end COLOSSUS THE FORBIN PROJECT was created. The film encapsulates the drama which unfolds immediately upon the completion of an atomic powered computer. In essence the greatest scientific minds of the world headed by none other than Dr. Charles Forbin Eric Braeden have combined their considerable talents to create the worlds' most advance machine which has but one purpose To insure the Peaceful CoExistence of the world's population. The film contains an extremely memorable line spoken by Dr. Forbin which comes to haunt him. Frankenstein should be required reading of all scientists. With the considerable talents of Gordon Pinsent as The President of the United States Leonid Rostoff as the Russian Premiere Susan Clark as Dr. Cleo Markham and William Schallert as CIA Director Grauber the dream of war weary officials to finally create the ultimate defense machine comes true. What everyone forgot was the fact a machine created to prevent war could morph into an atomic tyrant. Given the power to destroy the planet and the peoples it was meant to safeguard now threatens all with a maxim I was created to prevent war. I will not permit war even if I have to destroy mankind to do it. A terrifying prospect. The race begins between the monster and the creators to see which can out think the other to regain what was so recklessly given away. A Classic film in every sense of the word. ";

I can't remember the last time I was actually frightened by a film in the same way that I was frightened by this one. Typically my fear response only kicks in when I see a potent image thrust at me quickly or when a movie uses unusual eerie sounds to induce anxiety. Most films tend to frighten people by this primitive jackinthebox method.But the fear Colossus the Forbin Project gave me is the same fear I experienced after reading Orwell's 1984. It's the fear of being taken over. Of losing personal freedom. As the Colossus computer's demands and actions grow and become allencompassing the audience's reactions seem to mirror the Forbin character's reactions. To watch him slowly crumble in the face of what he has created is frightening because he seems so implacable for most of the movie. We put our faith in him because he reacts to each twist in the plot with a knowing smile.This is a film that gets under the skin in a big way. You have to think after watching it is this the way it happens? someone with good intentions doesn't realize the full extent of what he's created whatever it may be and it simply blossoms out of his control.A disturbing and important film.".

Everything is going swimmingly until one day Tom is arrested and charged with murder and war crimes dating back to his military service and raid in El Salvatore years earlier.  It seems Tom's entire identity is a lie and his name is really Ron Chapman a former Special Forces commando.Claire who is conveniently a prominent defense lawyer takes up his case determined to prove he is innocent choosing to believe his denials despite the fact that everything she knows about him is a fabrication.  She hires Charlie Grimes Morgan Freeman to assist her because until he became a broken down alcoholic he was once one of the top lawyers in the military.The film is paced well and balanced between courtroom drama and other related storylines like constant death threats a dirty general and a mystery man.  It is fairly standard fare but the presentation is engaging.Morgan Freeman is such a terrific actor that even a trite script can't keep him down.  He is wily and insolent as the washed up lawyer with a few tricks left up his sleeve.  Freeman projects an unassuming power in his work full of dynamism yet highly amiable.  His interaction with Judd is wonderful treating her with avuncular kindness and intellectual respect.Ashley Judd is a fine dramatic actor who returns to serious drama after an ill advised detour into romantic comedy Someone Like You'.  Judd is razor sharp in this film coming across as bright energetic and passionate.  She is tough as nails and doesn't back down to pompous military officers or thugs trying to intimidate her.Jim Caviezel rounds out the cast with a strong performance as the accused. This is a tough character because he is so mysterious and duplicitous. Caviezel delivered a strong portrayal of an enigmatic character in Angel Eyes' so he had some experience with this type of role.  He handles the part well appearing utterly sincere whether his character is telling the truth or not.Amanda Peet gives her standard performance as Claire's hair brained and sex obsessed sister.  Peet is no serious dramatic talent but she has this character down and comes across as believably ditzy and concerned about her sister despite their obvious sibling rivalry.This film doesn't fool anyone with its surprise ending but it does deliver good suspense a tried and true formula and some excellent performances.  I rated it a 710.  It's worth a look for viewers who like mysteries.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had little expectations for this film but I was pleasantly surprised when I was sitting in the middle of it. The film is yes perhaps predictable and we've seen it all before but something about it is full of high energy and scares and thrills and it's the perfect night at the movies. Ashley Judd plays a high profile attorney who's life is turned upside down when her carpenter husband is arrested for murder years earlier while in the army. The twist is she didn't know he was ever in the army and everything from her husbands name to where he was during the murder is all new to her. Still she manages to trust him as best she can and offers to help the young naive army attorney who has been assigned to her husbands case. To help them both with this heavy case that could bring the death penalty to her beloved husband they hire former Army Lawyer Charlie Grimes played by Morgan Freeman.Freeman is...well he's Morgan Freeman he doesn't really have to BE anything...but as usual he churns out a wonderful performance as the alcoholic lawyer who was discharged for dishonourable conduct. The case unfolds like a perfect mystery as the team of three along with Judd's sister played by Amanda Peet who turns out can actually act...who knew tries to find the truth behind the military cover up that ended up with the deaths of nine innocent civilians. All the pieces fit together and you're following the film on the edge of your seat and rooting for Judd's character. Everyone in this film plays a part and they play it just wonderfully. This movie is a real nail biter with plenty of cheap scares and drama. Morgan Freeman who during the course of the movie goes from recovered Alcoholic to renewed Alcoholic is interesting enough to hold the whole movie but he doesn't have to.Unfortunately as with some good things...there is always a downside. The ending is a cheap ridiculous thrill that is more of a let down than anything. After collecting all these facts that add up perfectly in everyone's mind including the audience every single one of those facts are forgotten and tossed aside in order for a ridiculous supposed surprise ending which is not a shock or surprise or even a oh my ending. Such an enormous let down for such a fantastic film. Why they thought they had to end it like this is ridiculous. However...in saying that don't let that stop you from checking out this movie because it's well worth your ten bucks at the theatre you won't be disappointed. I give this film a strong 8.510 but easily...without the ending could be taken as a 1010 movie.".

Still she manages to trust him as best she can and offers to help the young naive army attorney who has been assigned to her husbands case. To help them both with this heavy case that could bring the death penalty to her beloved husband they hire former Army Lawyer Charlie Grimes played by Morgan Freeman.Freeman is...well he's Morgan Freeman he doesn't really have to BE anything...but as usual he churns out a wonderful performance as the alcoholic lawyer who was discharged for dishonourable conduct. The case unfolds like a perfect mystery as the team of three along with Judd's sister played by Amanda Peet who turns out can actually act...who knew tries to find the truth behind the military cover up that ended up with the deaths of nine innocent civilians. All the pieces fit together and you're following the film on the edge of your seat and rooting for Judd's character. Everyone in this film plays a part and they play it just wonderfully. This movie is a real nail biter with plenty of cheap scares and drama. Morgan Freeman who during the course of the movie goes from recovered Alcoholic to renewed Alcoholic is interesting enough to hold the whole movie but he doesn't have to.Unfortunately as with some good things...there is always a downside. The ending is a cheap ridiculous thrill that is more of a let down than anything. After collecting all these facts that add up perfectly in everyone's mind including the audience every single one of those facts are forgotten and tossed aside in order for a ridiculous supposed surprise ending which is not a shock or surprise or even a oh my ending. Such an enormous let down for such a fantastic film. Why they thought they had to end it like this is ridiculous. However...in saying that don't let that stop you from checking out this movie because it's well worth your ten bucks at the theatre you won't be disappointed. I give this film a strong 8.510 but easily...without the ending could be taken as a 1010 movie.";

They are both a little different but still go along the same lines.This film is for people who appreciate good oldfashioned suspense thrillers.

She's a lawyer and decides to defend him herself but knowing nothing of Courts Martial she hired exdrunk Morgan Freeman to help her. Some shady stuff follows the charges are withdrawn and hubby turns out to be guilty after all and tries to off her. That's about all I understood.I used to teach classes to Marines at New River Air Station and every other class or so one of them would show up with a black eye. I finally mentioned this one night and a student asked What does that tell you about the Marine Corps? The students told me a lot more about the Marine Corps than this movie does. According to the movie the Corps is made up of beefy ugly bruits with haircuts you wouldn't believe blustering and pompous but they melt away like Wusses before Ashley Judd's fierce determination.I really like Ashley Judd by the way. She has a trim figure and a plump pretty asymmetrical and highly expressive face. Her left eyebrow is always cocked in disbelief. She has dark greenish irises that have a tendency to roll heavenward when she's exasperated. And she's a competent actress too when given the chance to act. I like Morgan Freeman too. His face is made of lumps in profile his nose seems lopped off at the end and in this film his hair is long and wooly and combed crazily backward as befits a recovering alcoholic. And he's the soul of reliability. If I wanted a doctor or a lawyer I'd look him up in one big jiffy. He can even be a credible drunk. Amanda Peet is properly sluttish but not really necessary. Paul Caveziel as the husband looks the part of the tough Marine but doesn't carry his weight or maybe it's partly that the role doesn't give him a chance.But  well then there's the plot. Forget about any sociopolitical comments on Special Ops in Central America. It's a murder mystery. All along we're led to believe along with Judd that the military is made up of a bunch of conniving morons and heavies. Dark cars and pickups follow Judd around. A gang of unidentified thugs jump out of nowhere and try to beat Freeman's brains out. Between the two of them Judd and Freeman spend half the movie with braces black eyes and bandages. In the end or so it seems the bad guys aren't the bad guys after all but the good guy is a bad guy or else maybe the bad guys and the good guy were both bad guys or  well you get the picture even if I didn't. The climax is just another womanwhodiscovershertrustedpartnerisamurdereandisnowgoingtomurderher scene. He trusses her up and is about to kill her although his expectations are unclear. What I mean is hubby has just had charges of mass murder withdrawn. He hasn't been acquitted so he's still chargeable and under suspicion. And Morgan Freeman has just uncovered evidence that hubby is guilty. Freeman calls Judd and gives her the dope. Now hubby is about to shoot his wife in their own home because she knows he's a murderer right? But meanwhile Freeman knows too. And there will be blood all over the place if he shoots his wife. What does he have to gain by killing her? Absolutely nothing. It's as if at this point the writers had thrown away the rest of the script and said Let's stick in a womaninjeopardy climax. The audience is too stupid to notice that it doesn't belong.Judd and Freeman aside this movie really doesn't have much to recommend it.It's doubly disappointing because the director was also responsible for the far superior One False Move. Well maybe some other time.".

I didn't understand why he had that outburst at the end but that's a minor detail. Judd is equally good as Claire except she seemed to be too slow at some parts. So did the pacing. It seemed to drag on a little and the genre seemed to be more like a courtroom drama instead of a crime thriller.Morgan Freeman is OK as the lawyer Claire hires. His acting seemed a little forced at times though. The plot though nothing new was one of those that were predictable but I was enjoying it too much to care. It's very entertaining if you just sit back and watch it instead of scrutinizing every little detail of it.But at the end after the final court scene it seems to continue on for a little long after spending an hour and a half leading up to that part. The running time was a little long. And the everlovable Amanda Peet plays a role where she could have gotten more time and shown off her acting ability. If you sit back for two hours and leave your mind on hold it's a very entertaining yarn.My rating 710Rated PG13 violence and some language.".

	schema:reviewBody "High Crimes is a thriller film starring Ashley JuddMorgan Freeman and James Caviezel. It costars Amanda Peet and Adam Scott.The screenplay by the husband and wife screen writing team of Yuri Zeltser and Cary Bickley is based on a novel by Joseph Finder.It was directed by Carl Franklin. Defense attorney Claire Kubik seems to have the perfect life. She has a high profile job at a big firm a beautiful home outside San Francisco and a husband Tom who loves her. Claire's biggest problem appears to be that she wants to have a baby and she's having trouble getting pregnant. But when the police investigate a routine breakin at her home they uncover the truth about her husband's identity and her life is thrown into turmoil. Claire finds out that her husband's name is actually Ron Chapman and that he's an exmarine accused of murdering seven innocent civilians in El Salvador during a raid in the late '80s.

It was refreshing to see a relic like HIGH CRIMES and catch some of the pleasure one used to feel when sitting down to watch a well crafted movie with a good cast. Since the movie revolves around a military court martial one of my favorite genres and some dirty coverups in EL SALVADOR right there is a story to work with. So many twists and turns including the climax leaves no slow sections that bog the viewer down. Also on the dvd is some nice bonus features about the books author and military code and directors comments. Ashley Judd  Morgan Freeman really shine along with every minor character.

	schema:reviewBody "Carl Franklin's High Crimes based upon Joseph Finder's novel of the same name could just possibly be interesting if it didn't try so hard to do so. Instead of building a complex web of a storyline the story instead reverts to reaching at the most impossible and improbable to further the intrigue and thus lessens it instead. The film draws many parallels with Robert Zemeckis's What Lies Beneath but lacks both the subtle art and spirited nature of that movie.Claire Kubik Ashley Judd is a highprofile lawyer who lives as part of an idyllic marriage. One day her husband Tom Kubik James Cavizel is arrested by the FBI for a war crime and a secret pastlife of his begins to unravel. Suddenly Claire finds herself defending her husband in a military tribunal that she is not familiar with along with the help of maverick Marine lawyer Charles Grimes Morgan Freeman. As expected everything that could ever possibly go wrong does go wrong which gives the film an strange pacing in which every time one thinks that the movie is over it isn't. The story goes to extremes to show how lopsided the odds are by bringing in conspiracies that reach up to Generals by having the prosecutor be the Marines' top lawyer by having the defense lawyer be an inexperienced loser and yada yada.The characters are all flat stereotypes and ultimately we don't really care about any of them from the uglyasadog mad Marine Major Hernandez Juan Carlos Hernandez to the seemingly prepubescent young Marine lawyer Lt. Terrence Embry Adam Scott assigned to defend Tom to Claire herself a caricature of the coolheaded modern female lawyer who because of her innerwarmth desperately wants to have a baby. Near the end the crudely typical vengeful South American character stands valiantly at a doorway reversing his role from throughout the film and you almost expect him to say que pasa?'Dialogue in the movie is unoriginal and contrived but is not poor enough that it stands out and overall is utterly unremarkable Ashley Judd exhibits an excellent performance in playing a confused loving strong woman and in her skill highlights the lack of acting ability in James Cavizel who is illmatched with her. Morgan Freeman plays the same lovable outcast character we've often seen from him and he does it well.Theo van de Sande's photography while neither innovative nor artistic is wonderfully polished and alternately expresses claustrophobic terror through close shots or dizzying confusion through a twirling dancing lens at the appropriate times. As is seen often in today's films Sande uses the color blue very heavily and also employs a shallow depth of focus.The original score by Graeme Revell is professional enough but is very generic and boring. In the movie particularly in the beginning and end the music awkwardly bounces back and forth between dramatic world music and RB.When the movie closes the viewer has gained nothing but has also lost nothing to this glossy but formulaic movie. Despite its faults it is an entertaining ride and the surprise ending so necessary to complete the movie that it is halfpredictable will act as redemption in the eyes of those who would otherwise leave with a bad taste in their mouths.High Crimes' is rated PG13. It contains blurry footage of corpses conspirator's intimidating violence humorous prostitutes and adorable grandfatherly drunkenness.".

Unbeknownst to Claire Tom served in the Marine Corps and deserted pending murder charges for having shot up a Latin American village. With faith in her husband's innocence Claire firmly committed to defend her husband turns down a deal for six years. Together with an immature inexperienced Marine legal officer and a washedout civilian attorney Claire sets out to ferret out the truth. Just what is the truth and does Claire really want to know? The answer is elementary even to dear Watson. Yet the movie does have some fine points about courtmartials in spite of its error in using the civilian term Murder first degree. Conflict of Interest In Defence of One's Relations The American Code of Professional Responsibility says that a lawyer shall exercise independent professional judgement. Obvious this means that the lawyer must stand above outside pressure to zealously represent the client. Less obviously the lawyer must stand apart from the client as well. Lets see this in action. Claire's decision to represent her husband is a bad but understandable. Close relatives should never undertake representation of family members. Yet the trial bar daily violates this apothegm. Egos the size of Texas fuel trial attorneys. None could possibly imagine anyone better. Yet a lawyer must make tough decisions give advice clients don't want to hear and divorced from the client's emotions. How can our heroine do that when she has been busy trying to make babies with Tom? This conflict in roles between spouse and lawyer looms to great significance in the rejection of a plea to a lesser offense. The decision to turn down the deal for six years is reprehensible but once again understandable. Despite clear guilt of desertion it might not appear such to a loving spouse. A spouse might accept as given Tom's declaration that he deserted out of fear a courtmartial would not. Tom's desertion has two aggravating factors pending charges and in armed conflict. In the military the desertion charge might be considered more serious by many military judges and panel member jurors than murdering a foreigner particularly when the foreigner is killed in reprisal. Punishment parties are regarded as a necessary part of military muscle even if editors of the Times think it ought not be so. The very admission of such a fear in a military court would cook him and push the sentence to the max. The Times to the country Clemenceau's adage military justice is to justice as military music is to music still pertains. As stirring as military music might be even the Air Force after legendary General Harmon chose not to keep up with the pop chart. Military Legal Officers JAGs on trial The standard charge given by dear old Judge Dennison in my time in the service read Military counsel are lawyers duly qualified by the bars of their home state and are certified by the Judge Advocate General to try and defend courtmartials. What exactly does that mean? The nerdy military defense counsel is characteristic not merely a microaberration. Most military lawyers are new to law young and inexperienced. To a polished lawyer they might appear to be utterly incapable. Was I ever that bad? Claire might have enquired. You were even if your Texassized ego can't admit. The appeal of the military in recruiting is precisely that the young lawyer will get many early opportunities to defend major cases. Everyone learns somewhere a thought which perhaps would not seem comforting to Tom but is the very point of JAG recruiting officers. What responds to this call is a wide variety of talent. Do you suppose it could be any different? In this movie the young lieutenant if focused at allconcentrates his energies not on the case but on Claire's rather loose sister who has become the defence team's camp follower. Military society is a close one. Thus the prosecutors and defense counsel do more than drink together enemies in court friends without. Does this work in the defendant's favor? I doubt it. A very sharp prosecutor might have abandoned the war crimes charge which could draw empathy for the accused from a military panel jury in order to concentrate on the desertion charge which will earn the accused no favor. Yet although not discussed in this movie the military ties the hands of the prosecutor as much or at least as effectively by limiting the prosecutor's tactical discretion as it mutes the defense by overloading it with youth and inexperience. Effete Liberal Society The movie does not limit itself to a probing critique of the JAG Corps it strikes out at effete liberal society and its askewed values. Theoretically as part of a commitment to an independent legal profession civilian society lives by the rule that lawyers must rush to the defence of unpopular causes and unpopular people. Indeed Claire is celebrated for having taken on the defence of slimy characters who have committed evil deeds. But liberal society sanctions defence for some evils and not others. The fanfare and flush of victory in a miscreant's cause are just tapering off when without much ceremony Claire is tossed from the exalted corner office for undertaking the defence of an accused war criminal. According to its own standard of political correctness liberal society picks and chooses which nastiness is nice enough to be defended.".

	schema:reviewBody "I always say that I will watch anything once.  Unfortunately because of that attitude I have been exposed to some absolutely horrible movies.  'Save The Last Dance' was horrible 'What Women Want' was horrible.  This movie as well though not as much as the other two I mentioned was horrible.  Its true that it is formulaic.  Its true then that it's predictable.  But thats no excuse for poor direction and laugh out loud dialogue. First of all I must discuss my disgust with Amanda Peet for being in this movie.  These are the kind of movies along with 'Whipped' that killed careers.  Whoever her manager is should be fired instantly.  Her character is unimportant in many ways and every line she utters is like someone sticking a tack in your head and then twisting it for a little while. Meanwhile Ashley Judd doesn't fair a whole lot better.  This is a typical Ashley Judd role though.  She gets beaten then she cries some.  You go girl.  And then I wonder whats up with Morgan Freeman.  How do you go from 'The Shawshank Redemption' to this piece of well its a piece of something. Of course we couldn't get through drivel like this without the usual array of plot twists to keep us on the edge of our seats.  Well in my case it would be shaking my head in disgust and my neck hurts after all of the disgust I had to endure during this movie.  Of course some of it was sooooo bad that it did make me laugh.  By that time it was just out of frustration of course.  SPOILER LINES I must comment on the last plot twist which I'm sure most of you could guess.  Its not the twist that was the problem but there is a fight scene in the last moments in the movie and it was the worst lit fight scene I have ever seen.  It was at night and the action is so poorly followed and edited that you actually can't tell who is hitting who and who is getting hit.  Until the closeup of the man on the floor you're never sure who got beaten up.  That was just absolutely horrible and it disgusts me thinking about it now thinking that somehow a studio executive said that this movie was suitable for viewing. END OF SPOILERIn conclusion I am going to say this.  Ashley Judd if you ever happen to read this I challenge you to pick one movie just one that isn't this insipidly bad.  I challenge you to pick a movie where the story doesn't seem as if it was told by a five year old and has a constant narrative flow. Find a director that can pace the action so it is tolerable and who knows how to piece a movie together.  Please save your career now while you still have a chance.  Don't make another 'Where The Heart Is' but do something good for a change.  I know that there's talent in your family and obviously you have to have some.  Find someone that will exploit it properly for once.  I don't want to see you in another 'Double Jeopardy'.  Step up to the big leagues please.  Unfortunately I can't give this movie high marks at all.  2 out of 10.".

It starts predictably with the happy married couple trying to have a baby so I see where some may tune out at this point but it gets better. There are some nice shots of San Francisco and Oakland where Claire practices law.Early into the film her husband is arrested by the FBI in an overblown scene and charged with 8 murders in Mexico. Military law is not her expertise so her lawyer at the firm recommends attorney Grimes Freeman.He is a recovering alcoholic and formerly a stellar attorney. He knows all the loopholes and teaches Claire a few in court. There are flashbacks to scenes in Monte Azul where in 1988 several murders took place in South America and there was a military coverup. A few officers with actors like Michael Shannon and others have bit parts. Amanda Peet is Claire's sister Jackie and gives the story some comic relief. Breuce Davison is also good as the nefarious General who knows the true facts.Normally the film would be an 8 but Morgan Freeman elevates the performances here and is believable as a man who has hit zero too many times and now must make a comeback. Claire learns a few disturbing truths as well her life is changed for the better though she endures a miscarriage and murder attempts as she is defending her husband during the murder trial.Overall a definite must see for anyone who likes a decent story and Morgan Freeman. 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "I quite liked the film. I would watch Amy Adams stare at grass and Emily Blunt is always top notch. One thing that stuck out for me about the film was that it offers a look at real workingclass people doing real work and does so in a respectful manner. Rose tries to put a positive spin on her postmortem cleanup work to gathered yuppies in an awkward social setting and is clearly defensive. But you can see her coming to value the work for the good it does. There is nothing wrong with adventure thrillers about high crimes and misdemeanors about the fartoowelltodo and about easy lives but it is heartening to see hardscrabble work valued not just as a barrier to be overcome but as a thing that has intrinsic value and that does real good. Rose and Nora take on work that the yuppie ladies would never dream of tackling and do real good for real people. This is a film that does not dazzle us with fireworks or glitter but it has heart. We like that.".

	schema:reviewBody "A struggling single mom named Rose Amy Adams in her comedydrama wheelhouse gets tired of working for a maid service and boldly decides to branch out into crime scene cleanup with her layabout sister Norah Emily Blunt ironically named in Christine Jeffs' observant and easygoing Sunshine Cleaning.Although it has been marketed as one of those quirky dramedies the studios love to shove down our throats every year Jeffs' film from a solid screenplay from Megan Holley is more in tune with somber yet hopeful indie character studies. The film deals with some dark subject matter and poignantly explores grief and family dysfunction but maintains a positive outlook and contains some solid situational laughs. The combination of an interesting setup smart writing likable characters and winning performances make the film even when it teetertotters from dark to sappy go down smooth. None of the characters seem forced upon us unlike the overtly quirky family from Little Miss Sunshine or the stylized dialog spewing teens from Juno. These characters talk and interact like real people and there's a naturalism in the way their relationships develop.It makes for engaged viewing when a film like this doesn't feel the need to explain every detail or tie up every loose end so nicely. Some subplots involving Norah taking a personal interest in one of the cleanup jobs that leads to an awkward friendship with a bloodbank worker Mary Lynn Rajskub of 24 fame or a onearmed supply store guy Clifton Collins Jr. who takes a shine to Rose aren't resolved in a typical fashion and some things are never made known or left openended. It makes the film feel truer to life. Even when Rose's precocious kid Jason Spevack tries to talk to heaven on a CB radio in what would normally be considered a contrived and cutesy moment you feel like you've grown to know the character and it's just something he would do. Likewise Alan Arkin as the sisters' scheming entrepreneurial father behaves and acts like a real guy who's had to struggle raising two girls alone and is just trying to help them catch a break.Amy Adams of course is an absolute delight. Something about her girlnextdoor good looks combined with her innate talents as a comedienne and her theatrical background that produces some of the best facial expressions and cryingoncue you'll ever see make her the perfect choice for this type of role. While it's easy to sing the praises of Adams and she's never been more endearing or relatable than here Emily Blunt proves to be an excellent foil. It's Blunt's sharp portrayal and her character's story arc that provide the film its emotional weight. Both actresses deserve to be remembered come awards season and Sunshine Cleaning is that rare springtime bird a film worthy of buzz.".

Perhaps this is a testament to Adams acting skills but I was impressed nevertheless.Sunshine Cleaning keeps you involved based on characters alone. There is certainly humour tragedy and emotion to drive the story but all is born from the relationship between this broken family. I wish fresh faced director Christine Jeffs had forgone all the trends of the recent independent film movement but there is still more then enough to admire about Sunshine Cleaning and even more to love.".

Meg Holly's screenplay set in Albuquerque New Mexico follows the unlikely story of Rose and Norah as they pursue their business in the biohazard removal crime scene cleaning service. Now that is novel. But Sunshine Cleaning is really about touchingly completing Rose and Norah's relationship with their dead mother. Adams balances vulnerability and brave resilience.

Jeffs and Holly demonstrate a natural compassion and power throughout Sunshine Cleaning.Rose is the dedicated single mom raising Oscar natural Jason Spevack. Oscar is having problems in school displaying antisocial behavior such as licking his teacher's leg. Oscar requires special schooling something Rose can't afford with her current cleaning service job. This is a far cry from her glorious cheerleader days. Oh yes she is having an affair with the former quarterback Mac jerky good Steve Zahn who has no intentions of leaving his wife. Rose's life is broken. At one point she breaks down telling Winston Clifton Collins Jr. I was good at getting guys to want me But she can't get them to love her.Younger sister Norah is the smart ass brazen slacker who can't hold a job. Norah lives with their Dad Joe wonderful Alan Arkin. Widower Joe instead of having a real job always has some sort of business scheme brewing whether it is selling candy pop corn or moving shrimp in bulk.

Of course she enrolls Norah into the business as well after all what else is Norah going to do. Rose forms a close bond with Cleaning Supply Owner Winston compassionate Clifton Collins but she is too blind to see that he is a decent man unlike Mac.The captivating narrative thread involves Norah's obsession to watch their mother's TV movie appearance where she plays a waitress. Both Rose and Norah deal with the tragedy of their mother differently. And it is not coincidence that their job deals with death and cleaning up all aspects of the aftermath the physical and the human. It's hysterical as Norah falls into a bloodied mattress. It is touchingly solemn as Rose sits with the elder widow whose husband killed himself. Jeffs reminds us of our humanity throughout. There is a mesmerizing scene as both Rose and Norah watch TV.Sunshine Cleaning is wonderfully quirky at times morbid with a twisted sense of humor. Sunshine Cleaning also reminds us that sometimes the people we least expect will step up and be great. Adams and Blunt are awesome. Take a chance on Sunshine Cleaning.".

	schema:headline " Illuminating as sunshine this film is a sharp sweet look at the working class";
	schema:reviewBody "Rose Lorkowski Amy Adams was once a popular cheerleader and a person of envy back in those high school years. However she has made some questionable choices since then and now works as a home cleaner to support herself and her young son Oscar. She does a have a backup system in her wheelerdealer father Joe Alan Arkin and in her frequently outofwork younger sister Norah Emily Blunt if she needs babysitters. She calls upon the eccentric Norah often especially so that she Rose can have a latenight tryst with a married policeman Mac Steve Zahn. Ouch she is still going in the wrong direction it seems. However Mac does give her a work tip. If she could get into the crime scene cleaning business she would be pulling in large bucks as removing blood stains is big stuff. Receiving some leads Rose does begin to get some assignments like cleaning up after suicide victims and folks that die in their slovenly homes. Reluctantly Norah agrees to help and Sunshine Cleaners is born. But with Oscar still having trouble in school and with Mac continuing to string her along in the love department will Rose really rise above her present circumstances? This is a fine film about people who work hard and get nowhere. First the cast is great with Adams Blunt and Arkin delivering terrific performances ones worthy of honors. Blunt especially is a treasure as the unconventional woman haunted by past circumstances and having trouble fitting into modern existence. The lesser actors are also nice but Zahn is unfortunately given no chances to show off his comedic touch. The setting in New Mexico is also lovely while the costumes and look of the film are likewise wonderful. That said special mention should also go to the very fine sharply worded script and the secure direction. This is a heartgrabbing story with unusual elements and unsettling realities. If you love films that are not of the typical churnemout variety this one is definitely a worthy choice. It is as illuminating as sunshine and as touching as they come.".

	onyx:emotionText "Rose Lorkowski Amy Adams was once a popular cheerleader and a person of envy back in those high school years. However she has made some questionable choices since then and now works as a home cleaner to support herself and her young son Oscar. She does a have a backup system in her wheelerdealer father Joe Alan Arkin and in her frequently outofwork younger sister Norah Emily Blunt if she needs babysitters. She calls upon the eccentric Norah often especially so that she Rose can have a latenight tryst with a married policeman Mac Steve Zahn. Ouch she is still going in the wrong direction it seems. However Mac does give her a work tip. If she could get into the crime scene cleaning business she would be pulling in large bucks as removing blood stains is big stuff. Receiving some leads Rose does begin to get some assignments like cleaning up after suicide victims and folks that die in their slovenly homes. Reluctantly Norah agrees to help and Sunshine Cleaners is born. But with Oscar still having trouble in school and with Mac continuing to string her along in the love department will Rose really rise above her present circumstances? This is a fine film about people who work hard and get nowhere. First the cast is great with Adams Blunt and Arkin delivering terrific performances ones worthy of honors. Blunt especially is a treasure as the unconventional woman haunted by past circumstances and having trouble fitting into modern existence. The lesser actors are also nice but Zahn is unfortunately given no chances to show off his comedic touch. The setting in New Mexico is also lovely while the costumes and look of the film are likewise wonderful.

I can say that not only was I not let down by this film but that it superseded them in the most refreshing way possible. There was something I noticed about the movie. It had great comical moments but it was not the funniest film ever. It had great acting writing and was filmed beautifully...and yet I'm sure that it is probably not the best film ever. What I loved about it though was that it was NOT like most films of late that try so hard to be the best film ever. You know the ones with the fancy film work and the melodrama...the lines written that are asking for an Oscar. Sometimes those just irritate me because they are trying so hard to be a great film and they forget to tell a great story. The film makers didn't forget that here. I was not distracted by anything. Everything came together in this film that I felt like I knew the people and I wanted to know what happened to them. I liked it because it reminded me that we're all human. I love that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sunshine Cleaning is an odd mix of grossout comedy and melodramatic family drama possibly why it's being compared to its producer's first film Little Miss Sunshine. The other reason might be that Alan Arkin is in it. But if the goal was to capture all of the sweet gooey fun of Little Miss then Cleaning comes up a couple inches short. This flick from director Christine Jeffs and screenwriter Megan Holley is less about being cute or sweet and more about how a person's death can shape our lives. It can be very funny at times and also a downer at times but what keeps things fairly level are the two fantastic performances coming from Amy Adams and Emily Blunt.They play sisters Rose Adams and Norah Blunt. Rose was once a high school cheerleader dating the star quarterback but now wonders what happened to her life. A single mother forced to work as a maid to support herself and her young son Jason Spevack Rose clings to what's left of the good in her life by being the mistress to the former HS Quarterback Steve Zahn and hoping that one day she has enough money to get her real estate license. Norah is the younger sister still living at home with dad Alan Arkin and too irresponsible to even hold on to a waitressing job. Desperately in need of money the two hear about the gross yet apparently lucrative business of biohazard clean up and before you know it they're the Martha Stewarts of murdersuicide aftermath.It's a funny premise and you can just imagine the morbid and disgusting fun the movie can have with blood body excretions horrible smells and other sloppy situations one might encounter with deadbody mess. A scene where Rose and Norah are carrying a mattress is grossout humor at its funniest. Holley likes these things but doesn't revel in them. She wants to add some heart as well and succeeds in being both honest and introspective as the job encourages both girls to think about how the death of their own mother has shaped them into the women they've become. Unfortunately the laughs stop in the second half and the family stuff is pushed to the point of being a drawnout downer.Another thing I thought the movie could have done better was the subplot of the girls bringing some comfort to the remaining family of the deceased. Rose sits with a woman whose husband just committed suicide and Norah befriends one's aloof daughter Mary Lyn Rajskub and tries to connect with her because of her own mommy issues. Just I wished the movie spent more time inserting the girls into the lives of these people and fleshing them out to a point where they're not just tools for sympathy. A supply clerk Clifton Collins Jr. is also tossed into the script as a possible love interest for later but nothing ever happens with him either.The melding of gross comedy and heartfelt family drama doesn't really work but what holds this movie together are what I believe to be the two best female performances i've seen all year so far. Adams is very sympathetic and resourceful as a woman trying to achieve respect again whereas Blunt plays the wayward younger sister role as both irresponsibly endearing her going on about the story of lobster man and how being a bastard is badass makes her a fantastic aunt and painfully vulnerable. The two of them together counteract each other and make a funny heartfelt pairing. The rest of the cast includes Alan Arkin whose quirky but doesn't really get that much funny material Clifton Collins who shows considerable charm and charisma despite playing a onearmed supply store clerk and Jason Spevack whose cute but not in that annoying little kid way.Sunshine Cleaning works on the backs of its two stars though. Overall it doesn't feel as much of a complete work as say Little Miss Sunshine not that I'm trying to compare the two or saying that Cleaning is a bad flick because it's not. I'd say its one of the better movies I've seen this year but it could have benefited from a tighter script.".

Sure one can view this as a simple story of the emotionally struggling sisters who start a biohazard cleanup company to connect not just with each other but also with those who have been the victim of a profound event involving a loved one. It works just fine on that level.Of course I never make things that easy. For this viewer I was absorbed in the connection the sisters had to their dead mother. The quest for a glimpse of her one movie of the week performance as a waitress had the sisters trained to stop in their tracks whenever a waitress scene appeared on TV. The sisters are played exceedingly well by the extraordinarily talented Amy Adams and Emily Blunt. Their performances lift a really good script to greatness.For most movies that would be plenty. Not here. Director Christine Jeffs Sylvia gets to play with Alan Arkin as the always scheming father a quick commentary on the disgusting solution of public schools tendency to require medication on less than robotic kids emotionally empty relationships and the absolute need of people to connect with others.The fine acting continues with Steve Zahn as the former high school hero turned local cop whom Adams' character has maintained a long term bond. Trouble is Zahn's character picked someone else to marry. Clifton Collins Jr adds a wonderful dimension as Adams' possibly new prospect. Mary Lynn Rajskub is just plain fascinating as the lonely lady Blunt thinks she is helping. Being promoted as from the creators of Little Miss Sunshine this one offers up a nice story complimented by many quirks that make it stand apart from the masses. Hopefully it will find wider distribution as we can never have enough top notch story telling.".

The highlight is Clifton Collins Jr.'s acting. He makes a onearmed mustachioed industrial cleaning vendor very likable and the parts involving him and Amy Adams are wonderful. Because Adams is also acting wonderfully as always in her best role as the always happy heroine..It's the small things in this movie that frustrate.

It worked because it was on the move. Because it knew it was a comedy with dramatic elements. Because it had a focus and solid characters. Characters that worked on their own that weren't symbols but their own entities. That's what Little Miss Sunshine had and what Sunshine Cleaning lacks.But it's made capably enough. It's not terrible. Many people like it. And if you want to relate to typical suffering in the world but not feel too bad it's probably a good one for you.

Everyone involved here pulls their weight and it's a wholly satisfactory result. The comedy is well placed while the drama mixed in with the Adams character touching and identifiable. Rose Lorkowski is interesting and pathetic simultaneously. The world has beaten her down and she seems to be straining under the weight of taking care of her whole family. I enjoyed the sister's relationship best of all including especially the first several cleaning episodes. The memories and mourning of their mother became a little heavyhanded a times but it didn't get too much in the way to pull down it's good rating. Definitely worth a rental.".

Since then I've been a little more impressed with Amy Adams' portfolio not to say Emily hasn't been a busy and talented young lady. But Enchanted put a spell on me and Doubt reinforced her June Bug award caliber acting chops IMO. So attending the Boulder Film Festival to see this movie was a nobrainer. With that said I was very surprised that Blunt's character was more compelling more extraordinary. That's not to say that Adams didn't deliver another memorable gem because she did. I just felt Blunt's performance was a little more indelible more enduring. Sunshine Cleaning has all the right ingredients to be a sleeper breakout hit. It's funny touching quirky and authentic. It cross purposes issues of insecurity and family dysfunctionality in an honest yet very wry and witty waynot that unlike Little Miss Sunshine which also has the word 'sunshine' in its title as well as the always satisfying Alan Arkin.There was a subplot between Blunt and 24's Mary Lynn Rajskub that left me wanting more. But outside of that one small complaint I highly recommend this refreshing dramacomedy. One more thing. A special call out to Clifton Collins Jr. who made being a onearmed hardware store clerk almost cool.Good flick. A satisfyingly good time.".

Alan Arkin Clifton Collins Jr Steve Zahn are all likable to one extent or another the exception's possibly Emily Blunt though that's more for her character than herself playing the part and that little kid playing Amy Adams' son who at one point talks to God on a CB radio in a cringe inducing scene.It's the script as it tries too hard to meld the quirky yes I'm using the word quirky it's appropriate here comedy and some pretty dark drama and it doesn't really come off authentic either way. There are a few scenes here and there that vary with potential but only scene when Adams sits and comforts the old woman whose husband has committed suicide felt completely and wholly emotionally satisfying then again this scene is not populated with getrichquick shrimp schemes or a onearmed guy or a kid who talks to God through a CB radio or another one of those I'll hang from something and scream loud ala the canyon scene in Garden State.I didn't ever really laugh either and I was only pulled into any of the drama because of the actors in the roles Adams is basically the best you'll get if you want an automatic tearingup machine.

Amy Adams' Rose is strong and a winner as she tells herself each morning from a PostIt on her bathroom mirror.

Emily Blunt's Norah also has issues  she cannot keep a waitress job at a restaurant that is really a lunch counter which does not need a waitress. There are tragic family issues beyond the Dad's business schemes that do not work out. And the crime scene cleanup business does not work out the character's or the family's issues. There are some cute scenes and some touching scenes but this film leaves many many questions unanswered.".

	schema:headline " ONE OF KUTNER'S BEST IN THE 50'S";
	schema:reviewBody "Helmut Kutner adapted the jolly novelette by Barbara Noack into a lighthearted and joyful romantic comedy with witty dialogue in the very good script. First viewing and an only rudimentary knowledge of the German cinema of the 50's  may let the viewer escape all the niceties of the film. Noack's novelette partly takes place within the German film industry and Kutner expanded this premise to satirize the making of the same film giving him the opportunity to mock the reigning laws within the German cinema. Furthermore he enriched the story by making the lead character into a more independent woman than in the novel.Quite some though friendly but always clear scoffing at the average sugar sweet German films of the 50's is going on. In the scene where the possibilities of filming the script are discussed a little statue of a deer is in the picture the Bambi was a German film prize. Sonja Ziemann regular in the Heimatfilm at one moment says That is what the people always want to see. Even a standard scene in genre Mountain film like the meeting of the girl and her two suitors in an Alpine hut is taken care of. Kutner does not spare himself too he always had a bit part for himself in his films and in this one he is a journalist saying to Bernhard Wicki who plays the film director! very well I am against directors playing in their own films.Kutner's direction is immaculate and I consider this stylish comedy one of his best films of the 50's and to be preferred to the film Hauptmann von Kpenick made in 1956 just before this one that gave him international recognition. The very good cinematography of Heinz Pehlke his first in colour in combination with the fine set and costume design make it a visually rewarding film as well. The music and songs by Michael Jary text probably by Kutner add to the enjoyment.The cast is good and Liselotte Pulver is extremely well as Juliana and Paul Hubschmidt is well typecast as the boring Swiss. And of course there could have been only one actor for the fictive part of Herr Uri Rudolf Platte who again only has a bit part but plays it like he has to carry the film. Anny Ondra and Max Schmeling have cameos.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 100minute Die Zrcher Verlobung or The Zurich Engagement or Getting Engaged in Zurich is a West German Germanlanguage movie from 1957 which means this one has its 60th anniversary this year. The director is Helmut Kutner possibly Germany's most successful filmmaker of his time and he is also among the writers who adapted Barbara Noack's novel here. It's neither one of Kutner's early or late career works. Noack is still alive today way into her 90s and she was still relatively young when this film came out. Also there are more adaptations of her works including this one here. Kutner's involvement also results in the participation of several pretty wellknown actors most of all Lilo Pulver in the lead. I won't go into detail about the supporting cast as you can check the list for yourself but if you know a bit about Germanlanguage film from that era then you will certainly recognize more than just one or two names.Anyway about the plot here it is all about the romance and the comedy even if there is a dramatic moment here and there as well for example about a boy who has to live without his deceased mother. It is the typical mixup comedy from Germany from that time and a lot of the comedy is about people mistaking people for other people and especially about not always funny plays on words. It is also a film on film as the protagonist is a writer in here and her autobiographical script gets picked up and results in people finding out things about her that she possibly did not want them to find out. Anyway overall I found this film slightly messy and the script lacks focus on quite a few occasions. If you are into somewhat schmaltzy romancerelationship comedies then maybe you can check it out but honestly I would not recommend it. Also I did not find Pulver's character as likable or charming as I would have liked and that's a crucial factor here not because you need to find characters likable in general to enjoy and appreciate a film but because Kutner and his gang try so hard to make you care for her here. Acting's mediocre sometimes over the top a common problem during that time script is mediocre frequently forgettable and the only somewhat good thing about this one is that it is in color unlike all the war movies from Germany from that decade. But this is obviously not enough. Watch something else instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warner Brothers' Get Smart's Bruce and Lloyd Out of Control represents a shrewd marketing tiein ploy with the studio's bigbudget Steve Carell revival of the Don Adams classic sitcom to attract viewers. Bruce Masi Oka of Heroes and Lloyd Nate Torrence of Marksman serve as CONTROL's equivalent of Qthe armor who furnishes gadgets to James Bondin most of the 007 escapades. Bruce and Lloyd create gadgets for their field agents. Most of the time these gadgets malfunction as exemplified by the 'cone of silence' in Get Smart. Incidentally Steve Carell doesn't appear in Out of Control but Agent 99 Anne Hathaway of Havoc puts in a cameo and complains about these two geeks giving Max all the cool gadgets while she gets none.This harebrained 71 minute comedy with these two klutzups is sporadically funny but never consistently hilarious. Bruce and Lloyd are sympathetic losers that we want to see win and they appear on the verge of their greatest triumph. They have developed what they call 'Optical Camouflage Technology' or a cloak that makes the wearer invisible. Initially the major problem is the shortlife of the battery. The Underchief Larry Miller of The Nutty Professor is Bruce and Lloyd's boss. He is constantly breathing down their necks like a quasivillain to goad them into perfecting the OCT. Failure to Launch scenarists Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember ramp up the suspense when somebody steals the invisibility cloak and our heroes run amok trying to retrieve it. A subplot about a man abducted by a ruthless dictator of a fictional nation the Republic of Maraguay a small angry nation sandwiched between Paraguay and Uruguary complicates the issue. Meanwhile although they aren't qualified for field work Bruce and Lloyd tangle with the CIA and other henchmen to recover their greatest invention. One of the tiresome gags in this lame comedy is that everybody confuses Bruce for Lloyd and Lloyd for Bruce.Get Smart's Bruce and Lloyd Out of Control is an outrageously priced DVD that contains few special features and there is nothing special about the plot. Masi Oka and Nate Torrence are fun to watch but they rarely blurt out sidesplitting dialogue and the plot is terminally predictable. Larry Miller gets the best line when he warns Lloyd about the repercussions should he fail to supply him with the OCT. There's an old Navy expression. If I go down you go down on me. The malapropism here is perfect and Miller delivers it without a selfconscious wink! Presumably when Warner Brothers made Get Smart they must have filmed too much footage and had to decide what to do with the surfeit. The unfortunate thing about Get Smart's Bruce and Lloyd Out of Control is that a lot of people are going to buy this substandard movie with the mistaken assumption that it boasts additional footage of Steve Carell. Again Steve Carell doesn't appear in this spinoff spoof. Perhaps the ultimate insult is the movie ticket that comes packaged in Get Smart's Bruce and Lloyd Out of Control. The ticket carries a value of only 7.00 making it useful only for a matine talk about cheap! Altogether this item works on the level of an inferior National Lampoon video.".

Not that it's parent movie Get Smart was much better so it's not surprising.Fairly lame and only average for a straight to DVD movie.What was great....the scenes with Patrick Wharburton! The real smashem physical stunts and overall Three Stooges type of comedy did succeed! Just needed a lot more of that a less dry humor that fell flat. I really don't know why Himey didn't have a starring role in this movie. Especially since the successful gags were his scenes! Overall it's a lame movie that really should have been better a lot better. All the characters are cool enjoyable but just flat not funny. Like a sitcom that has potential but just needs to be reworked to be funny. Get Smart needed Himey in it's story to be better and Bruce and Loyd can't even get off the tarmac Himey less.".

	schema:headline " Consider this a elongated movie promo that should have aired before the movie...or not at all....";
	schema:reviewBody "First let me say that everyone should see Get Smart. Both the original series because it is a stone cold classic and the new remake with Steve Carell because it really is a terrific fun action comedy with a great cast. Sadly somehow the film makers thought it would be a good idea to take the two worst supporting characters from the film and make some sort of promotional rip off film to whet your whistle for the movie but all it does is leave a sour taste and if anyone sees this before the Get Smart remake you won't want to even bother with Get Smart and that is a disappointment in itself. The idea of making this is not bad it's just the execution of making it. I think it's a great idea to make a little sub movie for DVD that follows up or follows during the film with some cast cameos from the film. But unfortunately they took the two worst cast members from the series. When I did the review for Get Smart I didn't even discuss the two characters that play Bruce and Lloyd because thankfully they were hardly in it and I thought they were kind of boring and had no character arc to them and were just there for the sake of being there...extras almost. But apparently someone thought different and wasted their time making this.Masi Oka is no stranger to acting. He's been on Television and film for the better part of 10 years on various shows and films and most recently found fame as everyone's favorite hero with the ironic name Hiro Nakamura on NBC's Heroes. I've always thought he's done a great job on that show and now that I've seen him in something else I pray he sticks to his day job. Oka plays Bruce a highly intelligent tech for Control who creates an invisible cloak that everyone wants including the CIA and KAOS. He has no depth to the character at all although his character is slightly better than his sidekickcostar. I think maybe he might have been a little better had he had a better cast around him but still the film should never have focused on him. Nate Torrence...loved him in the small role on Studio 60 sadly canceled long before it's time absolute disaster in this role in this film. He plays Lloyd Bruce's supposedly intellectual equal and partner but Lloyd comes across as an utter doofus and is simply there so they can make numerous fat jokes and have the ugly dude get the hot girl. Torrence and Oka have NO chemistry together and that is really what this film should be about. Jayma Mays is the almost one redeemable performance as the lovely and quiet Nina who smells of dead flesh she's a coroner of sorts. Her and Oka have a little chemistry far more than Oka and Torrence certainly. I would have rather had her in the entire film than the two of them. Marika Dominczyk is also half decent as the sexy spy who steals the cloak. She would have been good in the actual Get Smart film as opposed to wasting her in this garbage. Larry Miller's dry comedic talent is wasted and makes him look annoying and angry in the role as Bruce and Lloyd's supervisor. The only high point in the film was a brief cameo by 99 herself Anne Hathaway which directly tied into a scene in the actual film a clever little easter egg for fans. I had also hoped after the disappointing briefness of Patrick Warburton's performance as Hymie in the film that he would play a bigger role in this...which would have completely made this worthwhile but the role is even smaller. Ironically and smart on his part he is not listed in the cast for the film.This isn't really a movie at all. It's an episode of some kind...an elongated promo that doesn't promo anything really. The 'movie' clocks in at just over an hour and will leave the bitter taste of stupidity in your mouth. And it's not even the kind of stupidity you can laugh at. It's the kind of stupidity that comes with a straight to video National Lampoon's movie. They handed over the directing rights to this sub story to Gil Junger who has done plenty of Television but really nothing of substance which is again another mistake on their part. Truth be told they slapped this together to try to cash in. I don't think they even tried. So unless you're a HUGE fan of Get Smart and even then I wouldn't bother. This one is a stone cold dud to say the least. Let's pray they're not thinking TV Series. 410".

The movie is really predictable. Anne Hathaway has a cameo which doesn't really matter cause she wasn't funny. Steve and the Rock don't show up either.

	schema:reviewBody "'The Dancer Upstairs' marks John Malkovich's debut as a film director but it's hardly his first time in the director's chair Malkovich was a charter member of the nowprestigious Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago where he split time between acting and directing developing the versatility that has earned him regard as one of the best character actors in the business. He brings a stage director's consciousness to this fine unexpectedly suspenseful and complex thriller a fictionalized dramatization of events surrounding the rise and fall of the Shining Path revolutionary movement in Peru.In the lead role of Detective Augustin Rejas is Javier Bardem already an established star in his native Spain who is gaining increasingly wide notice in the US for his awardwinning turns in Julian Schnabel's 'Before Night Falls' 2002 and Alejandro Amenabar's 'The Sea Inside' 2004. Bardem like Malkovich is a wonderfully versatile actor and this film offers him another fine opportunity to display his range as Rejas an idealistic police detective who abandoned a promising career as a trial lawyer in the hope that he might be able to work within the system to heal the corruption of his native country left unnamed though the story clearly borrows from actual events in Peru.The film opens on the high plains at the foothills of the Andes with Rejas working at a highway checkpoint station. He encounters a vehicle bearing a mysterious undocumented passenger. While Rejas follows procedure his colleague accepts a bribe and allows the vehicle to flee the scene.Years later Rejas has advanced through the ranks and now works as a detective in the nation's coastal capital. He and his partner Sucre Juan Diego Botto making the most of a small role gradually begin to discover evidence of a burgeoning revolutionary movement led by the enigmatic 'Presidente Ezequiel' whom Rejas eventually realizes to be the same man he met briefly years earlier at the mountain checkpoint. The followers of Ezequiela former college professor and Marxist who went underground ten years earlier to foment a 'fourth wave' of communist revolution the first three being the USSR China and Cubabegin to terrorize the capital and outlying regions with suicide bombings and brutal assassinations. Rejas must uncover the secret of Ezequiel before the President enacts martial law and turns the government into another version of the brutal dictatorships previously seen in Bolivia Chile and Argentina.As the Ezequiel mystery deepens Rejas begins to develop an infatuation with his daughter's ballet instructor Yolanda Laura Morante with who he shares an unspoken bond and who seems to be an attractive alternative to his own wife Alexandre Lencastre a sweet but superficial woman who obsesses over fashion magazines and makeup and begs her perpetually broke husband to let her get a nose job. Rejas begins to court Yolanda and as he becomes more deeply involved with her he begins to discover evidence that she may be knowingly or unknowingly connected in some way to Ezequiel.The political dimension of the story is fascinating but the main source of conflict is the interior world of Rejas a sensitive morally decent man who is torn between his faith in the law and his sympathy for the people who suffer at the hands of corrupt government officials. Rejas is also torn between his sense of honor and decency and his profound emotional attraction to Yolanda. It's a tough role to pull off and Malkovich gives Bardem the time and opportunity to draw the character's emotional complexity with subtle patient expressive moments and line deliveries. Bardem has the rare ability to convey distinct emotions or states of thought with subtle gestures and nuanced facial expressions and Malkovich demonstrates an actor's trust in another gifted actor to accomplish the film's emotional subtext.There are a few problems here and there. Rejas' attraction to Yolanda is understandable but their burgeoning relationship feels a bit forced and underdeveloped at times. A subplot involving the Chinese embassy is introduced but left more or less unresolved. The plot is vaguely predictable though in the film's defense the suspense has more to do with how Rejas will deal with the revelations his investigation will uncover than with what will actually be revealed.Even with the flaws 'The Dancer Upstairs' is a highly intelligent and entertaining film and offers yet another opportunity for American audiences to become acquainted with the fabulously talented Javier Bardem who is my pick to be the next Marlon Brando.".

	schema:headline " Plod got there in the end  no fancy steps required";
	schema:reviewBody "I suppose this could be described as an offHollywood detective story with political overtones. It is based on a book by Nicholas Shakespeare a parttime Australian who has in turn loosely based his story on the rise and fall of the Shining Path' or Sendero Luminoso insurgency in Peru 19801995. As rendered on film Shakespeare also wrote the screenplay we have an immensely likable policemen Rejas played to perfection by Javier Bardem literally searching through the rubbish to find the shadowy Ezequiel leader of a movement with a fine record of atrocities but no program or real philosophy.Nicholas alas is no Shakespeare and the film becomes very slow in parts though there are plenty of dramatic moments and some crisp editing. Bardem gets good support from some of the other actors such as Juan Diego Botto who plays his sidekick Sucre and Laura Morante as Yolanda the enigmatic ballet teacher he becomes involved with. Most of the cast are Spanish but the prodution was filmed in English which has created an intermittent audibility problem. The film is also beautifully shot the locations in Ecuador and Oporto Portugal being used to great advantage.While the film succeeds quite well as a detective story it telegraphs too many punches to work as a thriller. However it's the politics that really let it down. Clearly we have a not very nice if elected government under attack and it's almost inevitable that the even more not very nice Army is going to step in. Against who? People who load up dogs with dynamite and send them in to crowded marketplaces. People who send in 10 year olds into village cafes to blow up themselves along with some local notables. The explanation for this comes only in oneliners such as I am already dead I live only for the revolution.' When Ezequiel the former philosophy lecturer is finally captured all he can say is You cannot capture this  tapping his forehead. We are already part of history.' Surely there is a better explanation for Shining Path' than this. My own theory is that it is a rather nasty combination of French postmodern philosophy Derrida Foucault etc mixed up with Marxism and Maoism and served up to people with not much to lose. If you are already dead you might as well die for the revolution. It's either that or slave for the whites.Actually Shining Path' had some competition in the shape of Tupac Amaru who captured the Japanese Embassy in Lima and held 70 or so people hostage for over 4 months in 199697 until being overwhelmed by Peruvian commandos who tunnelled in beneath them. None of the guerrillas survived. By the time I visited Lima and the Cuzco area in late 2000 all was quiet on the revolutionary front though President Fujimori hero of the embassy siege despite having won a recent election was on his way out. I haven't read it yet but I'm told Gustavo Gorriti's The Shining Path A History of the Millenarian War in Peru' is a good history of the era.Maybe it's asking too much for political explanations though the director clearly wants the film to be compared with CostaGravas' excellent State of Siege' which is shown briefly at one point and provides a vital clue as to Ezequiel's location. As to the direction Malkovich seems a little uncertain whether he is making a thriller or something more reflective but he has a good sense of dramatic timing and a good visual sense. Perhaps more attention to the editing would have sharpened up the mood.".

	onyx:emotionText "I suppose this could be described as an offHollywood detective story with political overtones. It is based on a book by Nicholas Shakespeare a parttime Australian who has in turn loosely based his story on the rise and fall of the Shining Path' or Sendero Luminoso insurgency in Peru 19801995. As rendered on film Shakespeare also wrote the screenplay we have an immensely likable policemen Rejas played to perfection by Javier Bardem literally searching through the rubbish to find the shadowy Ezequiel leader of a movement with a fine record of atrocities but no program or real philosophy.Nicholas alas is no Shakespeare and the film becomes very slow in parts though there are plenty of dramatic moments and some crisp editing. Bardem gets good support from some of the other actors such as Juan Diego Botto who plays his sidekick Sucre and Laura Morante as Yolanda the enigmatic ballet teacher he becomes involved with. Most of the cast are Spanish but the prodution was filmed in English which has created an intermittent audibility problem. The film is also beautifully shot the locations in Ecuador and Oporto Portugal being used to great advantage.While the film succeeds quite well as a detective story it telegraphs too many punches to work as a thriller. However it's the politics that really let it down. Clearly we have a not very nice if elected government under attack and it's almost inevitable that the even more not very nice Army is going to step in. Against who? People who load up dogs with dynamite and send them in to crowded marketplaces. People who send in 10 year olds into village cafes to blow up themselves along with some local notables. The explanation for this comes only in oneliners such as I am already dead I live only for the revolution.' When Ezequiel the former philosophy lecturer is finally captured all he can say is You cannot capture this  tapping his forehead. We are already part of history.' Surely there is a better explanation for Shining Path' than this. My own theory is that it is a rather nasty combination of French postmodern philosophy Derrida Foucault etc mixed up with Marxism and Maoism and served up to people with not much to lose. If you are already dead you might as well die for the revolution. It's either that or slave for the whites.Actually Shining Path' had some competition in the shape of Tupac Amaru who captured the Japanese Embassy in Lima and held 70 or so people hostage for over 4 months in 199697 until being overwhelmed by Peruvian commandos who tunnelled in beneath them. None of the guerrillas survived. By the time I visited Lima and the Cuzco area in late 2000 all was quiet on the revolutionary front though President Fujimori hero of the embassy siege despite having won a recent election was on his way out. I haven't read it yet but I'm told Gustavo Gorriti's The Shining Path A History of the Millenarian War in Peru' is a good history of the era.Maybe it's asking too much for political explanations though the director clearly wants the film to be compared with CostaGravas' excellent State of Siege' which is shown briefly at one point and provides a vital clue as to Ezequiel's location. As to the direction Malkovich seems a little uncertain whether he is making a thriller or something more reflective but he has a good sense of dramatic timing and a good visual sense. Perhaps more attention to the editing would have sharpened up the mood.";

	schema:reviewBody "I would expect a movie directed by John Malkovich to be intense and specific. The Dancer Upstairs is that. It is a political movie that while popular in Europe does not tend to draw well in the United States. Too bad.The story tells the tale of a lawyer who has left the law looking for a better system. I don't know that becoming a police detective is that much better but it serves the story. The story is set in a nameless Latin American country  which also suits the story line.Detective Lt. Agustn Rejas Javier Bardem has left a law firm where he was a junior partner to join law enforcement  with a conscious. He can give a break to a traveler whose papers are not quite right and he can be relentless in his pursuit of a terrorist.Rejas has been victimized by the politics of his country. His father lost his coffee farm to the soldiers. His view of the judicial system has seen a rapist become president of the country. But still Rejas finds joy in his beautiful dancer daughter and his wife  who has a political mission of her own. Then he meets the free spirited dance instructor for his daughter.Rejas works in a corrupt society where the fiscal corruption goes hand in hand with the moral and political corruption. The central government is all too ready to suspend civil rights and to put military law into effect. The military killing innocent people is fine as long as it suits the party.Rejas attempts to live the just life and must deal with the corruption the best he can. This conflict is the heart of the movie. As he says he has feelings about his father losing his farm and he is the Gary Cooper type.Javier Bardem is excellent in the pivotal role. Juan Diego Botto does a very credible job as Detective Sgt. Sucre.  Laura Morante is intoxicating as dance instructor focal point of the story.I give this move a 9 for great story and suspense excellent direction and fine acting. There is no sex and very brief nudity. The violence does tend to be horrific and there are depictions of cruelty to animals  both central to the plot. This is far less than the typical Jason or Chainsaw movies gore.I consider this an excellent direction debut for John Malkovich and look forward to his next feature film effort. It feels like Malkovich will fill a role similar to Robert Redford in films he has directed.".

Rejas finds himself embroiled in a lifeanddeath mystery when he investigates an underground terrorist organization that is targeting key government officials for assassination. Who these people are is not at all clear to those in charge and even their motives can only be guessed at.

It is in the bringing together of these two seemingly disparate plot lines that the movie fails ultimately to satisfy.  For roughly the first three quarters of the film as Rejas collects his evidence and unravels the puzzle we gladly go along where the filmmakers are taking us fascinated by the setting the atmosphere and the contemporary relevance of the terrorism theme.   But when towards the end the story kicks into high tragedy mode the movie loses us partly because the plotting itself is not particularly credible and partly because the relationship between Rejas and the woman has not been sufficiently developed to achieve the status of genuine tragedy. The film is much better when it sticks to the business of the case and leaves all the existential navelgazing out of the mix.This is not to demean either the moving beautifully modulated performance of Bardem or the stark selfassured direction of Malkovich who shows he knows how to function as well behind the camera as he does in front.  True the film is a trifle slow at times but this just shows that Malkovich will not be rushed when the material itself demands deliberation and care. Although the movie is about a half hour too long real languor begins to set in only during the final stretches.  Until then The Dancer Upstairs' makes for rewarding viewing.".

Some say this is clearly a rightwing movie and that Malkovich is right wing as well. What has the political preference of the director to do with it? This movie isn't rightwing nor is it leftwing. It clearly shows both sides giving you the police detective who works for the rightwing government who falls in love with the leftwing activist.If there is one remark that I have to make than it must be the fact that the actors didn't speak in Spanish.

We are told that none of the animals were harmed in the making of the film and presumably also none of the people.  As far as I am concerned that is the end of that matter  the use of animals unhamred for this purpose is acceptable.  To argue otherwise I find frankly daft. However I would recommend that people who get particularly upset when violence to animals is depicted should simply avoid this movie.Back to the movie  the acting and the cinematography are superb.

	schema:reviewBody "Acclaimed actor John Malkovich has made his directorial debut with an assured political thriller that combines tension and intelligence to make for a gripping two and a quarter hours. The setting is a South American country which is unnamed but the clear inspiration for the storyline is the early 1990s experience of Peru which I have recently visited when the bizarre Abimael Guzman led the murderous Shining Path movement while the movie was shot in Spain Portugal and Ecuador. Javier Bardem plays Augustin Rejas a former lawyer turned policeman who manages rare dignity and honesty as he battles with the interventions of a regime teetering on the edge of a military dictatorship and the pursuit of a fanatical revolutionary codenamed Ezekiel while struggling with the varying emotions associated with a vapid wife an adoring daughter and his daughter's dance teacher the eponymous and allurring woman upstairs Laura Morante as Yolanda. Bardem  who reminds me of an early Raul Julia  gives a languid yet charismatic performance and hopefully we will see much more of this talented actor.  In some respects the work is reminiscent of CostaGavras's State Of Siege a clip of which is actually used here. However the movie is based on a novel by the British writer Nicholas Shakespeare who wrote the screenplay which features some conversation in Quechua a native language of Peru and Bolivia and this is a more personal examination of terrorism than the 1973 movie.".

Where 'Ezechia' philosopher and revolutionary leader bear more than a little resemblance to Peru Sendero Luminoso's Abimael Guzman. It is John Malkovich's second time in the Director chair and he deserves great credit for his decision to almost singlehandedly bring Nicholas Shakespeare's novel to the silver screen. People may argue that this movie is stylistically and formally floored I personally don't care I loved this movie it is absorbing with a complex unconventional plot which makes you think. And by the end we all like Xavier Bardem's Captain Rejas will end up falling for vulnerable femme fatale Yolanda beautifully played by Laura Morante. Purists may object to an English language movie set in South America and where the actors are mostly Spanish but nowadays this seems to have became alas fairly common!

	schema:reviewBody "John Malkovich's directorial debut is this deeply lyrical character study of a morally upright cop Javier Bardem trying to make sense of an inexplicably violent world. As played by Bardem Augustin's face registers a nearconstant state of moral warfareredolent of Benicio Del Toro's work in Trafficeven as wry grimaces betray the absurdity of his situation. In an unnamed Latin American capital asphyxiated dogs hang from light poles placards featuring baleful epigrams written in blood drooping from their necks. It is the calling card of mysterious revolutionary leader Ezequiel whose seemingly limitless queue of selfeffacing disciplesincluding suicidebomber children and machine gunwielding Catholic schoolgirlsuncomfortably echoes radical groups in the Middle East and many points between. But what raises this film above topical exploitation is the provocative decision by screenwriter Nicholas Shakespearewho also wrote the noveland John Malkovich to disregard American foreign policy completely not even a mention of the UN and to only address the story in localized terms. Perhaps it is specious of me to assume the U.S. would jump into such a hotbed environment of interior social discord but judging from its parallels with Haiti both the location here and the situationrevolutionaries rebel against an elected an appointed? presidentseem eerily ripe for external overhaul.The film's perspective of selfreliance is illustrated in Augustin's decision to bring Ezequiel down without reporting to the presidenta breach of protocol that circumvents stateappointed justice and speaks to a desire for a unilateral democracy empowered by the people. This idea of unilateral democracy is fresh in its refusal to blame anyoneincluding the shadowy nominally communist radicals who kill with startling stealth and brutalityfor the problems of the world. Shakespeare and Malkovich's idealism in this regard is tremendously heartening The assumption that countries not only take pride in resolving their own conflicts given the chanceand not without significant losses as an early montage illustrates in gruesome detailbut desperately need to lest they remain fledgling nonentities into the foreseeable future strikes me as a very reasonable progressive idea. Anyway breaking away from the soapbox it is clear in those penultimate scenes that Bardem faces a unique existential crisiswhat is the price of selling out? And the last shot punctuated by the strains of a probing Nina Simone ballad is the work of a seasoned humanist.".

They grab you where it matters and lead you to uncharted territoriesI would never guess that this film would fall into the third category. But it does despite its flaws which are not few. For his work as an actor i always thought Malkovich was an interesting person. There is a kind of disturbed lucidity that overshadows even his loudest commercially oriented interpretations. Also if you check is role choices he is one of those guys who gets into crap projects to make a living and than finds time to work in things that motivate him. That's why we have 3 participations in Oliveira's films. Here he tried directing.On the surface the story is a bad choice. How and what happens is uninteresting predictable and even incoherent. But there is something great we are led into thinking we will watch a political thriller high conspiracies that affect the lives of small people. The lonely hero who will do the right thing. Having not read the book i'm guessing it points that way. The beginning of the film gives that impression as well. But than Malkovich deceives us and smoothly pushes us into a deeper layer of personal emotions of character development through people's relations. In the end this is a story about an interesting character caught up in a corrupt shallow world who makes his way into trying to live an honest life looking for a more honest way to practice the law. A little bit like Malkovich's career. We have that character beautifully played by a highly focused Bardem a very interesting method actor. His character lives polarized by three women his empty headed wife his dance oriented daughter and her troubled dance teacher. How he swings among them is what matters. For how the political background intersects Bardem's emotional life i think the story helps but i found it a major flaw that Malkovich wasn't able to make us understand when we should really give up on the after all useless thriller and focus on what he sure wanted to do which was to center us on the head of Bardem's character. I know Malkovich wanted it better but hey this was only his first try.The direction is uneven. We have some poorly edited dialogs which work against the actors and the fluidity of the story and some bad choices in the scene sequences that perturb the understanding of the plot. Basic mistakes. Worse than that some times Malkovich looses the grip and let's us spectators wandering about where to go next. This tense and concentrated film requires a gripping direction which Malkovich doesn't deliver consistently. But we also have pieces of honest pure and beautiful cinema which include performances. Among these we have a dancing lesson inter cut with the murder of three people in a theater performance having the audience take those executions as a part of that performance. And we have the very final scene a performance of the child with Bardem rushing to get there. Those and other bits were truly powerful sincere and moving. Should we have this consistency through all the film and we'd have something really powerful.There is something particularly well done the locations. Malkovich is known to be around Portugal often so i imagine he chose personally most of the locations. Anyway they always add to what he tends they are a permanent character that en forms what we are supposed to see. In this specific point the film is consistent all the way. I'm guessing a lot of time was put into choosing the places.My opinion 45 there is a true soul behind this despite its flaws as a film.httpwww.7eyes.wordpress.com".

	schema:reviewBody "This is John Malkovich's first feature length film as a director he did a short. In fact it is his only film as a director and one wonders why as it is clearly a great effort. Like Javier Bardem Before Night Falls No Country for Old Men who stars in the film the slow almost monotonous tone of Malkovich is seen throughout. Perfect for the story being told.The film is a complex political mystery story based on the hunt for Abimael Guzmn the founder of Per's Sendero Luminoso Shining Path in the 1980s.Bardem never seems to change expression whether he is hunting a terrorist or romancing his daughter4's ballet teacher. He is pursuing something both times. He does that in his slow manner method. Even when presented with the fact that illusions are just that he keeps hoping and trying until he realizes that it will only be through his daughter's dance that he can have the teacher.If there is anything to criticize in the film it is the teacher Laura Morante's The Empire of Wolves complete lack of political interest or emotion. I suspect that may be Malkovich's doing as he is not of the proper political thought to be making this type of movie.One could certainly understand Bardem's passion for something more meaningful in a relationship once meeting his wife Alexandra Lencastre who cared for nothing but looking better.An excellent performance by Bardem.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is John Malkovich's first feature length film as a director he did a short. In fact it is his only film as a director and one wonders why as it is clearly a great effort. Like Javier Bardem Before Night Falls No Country for Old Men who stars in the film the slow almost monotonous tone of Malkovich is seen throughout. Perfect for the story being told.The film is a complex political mystery story based on the hunt for Abimael Guzmn the founder of Per's Sendero Luminoso Shining Path in the 1980s.Bardem never seems to change expression whether he is hunting a terrorist or romancing his daughter4's ballet teacher. He is pursuing something both times. He does that in his slow manner method. Even when presented with the fact that illusions are just that he keeps hoping and trying until he realizes that it will only be through his daughter's dance that he can have the teacher.If there is anything to criticize in the film it is the teacher Laura Morante's The Empire of Wolves complete lack of political interest or emotion.

The characters are real and unlike the acting that you would see in a Hollywoodstyle production the characters exhibit emotions that are true. For instance when Lt. Rejas enters into the shanty town with his drawn pistol his hands are shaking and his actions are jerky unlike the Ramboesq confidence exhibited by the standard movie cop.  Laura Morante as Yolanda is enchanting and hauntingly beautiful.  The unstated attraction between the two lead characters is palpable in the film.   All of this though merely enhances a wonderfully illustration of  and commentary on the relationship between the rule of law and the rule of man or the military in this case in South America.".

The devilisheyed manic actor John Malkovich direct his first feature The Dancer Upstairs' with mature visual depth and some character development only a bit faster than the movement of 31 glaciers I recently saw in Alaska.  You won't take your eyes off of Javier Bardem either Before Night Falls' as Augustin a former LatinAmerican lawyer turned investigator trying to find Ezequiel a revolutionary leader causing mayhem with symbolic atrocities meant to destabilize the new government. Bardem who memorably played Cuban poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas in Before Night Falls' is completely different here as a slightly clueless cop with strong intuition and a feeling for his daughter's ballet teacher the upstairs' dancer that complicates his marriage and profession. Malkovich sets the pace to the character's measured approach to his case and his life the latter memorably occupied by a frivolous wife obsessed with her looks. Slow as Augustin is I couldn't help but feel that Malkovich sacrificed modern quickcut noir for oldfashioned reality depicting the difficult and elusive tracking of a master criminal.But Malkovich kicks into high action cross cutting gear when Augustin is close to capturing Ezequiel and the director gently presents an irony otherwise known as a plot twist that perfectly represents the nave detective he and the ballet teacher play a game at a cantina that shows how wrong our first impressions of character can be and the insidious corruption of even the most virtuous in volatile Latin countries.In addition to the delicious character creation the director shows the disquieting effects of martial law forcing an American audience to think quietly about the longterm effects of AshcroftRumsfeld terrorist detentions. CostaGavras's State of Siege' has a part in the film and serves as a touchstone for Malkovich's success. Malkovich doesn't have the master's energetic indignation but he does have his GrahamGreene ability to show flawed heroes saving themselves from destruction in a boiling climate by watching waiting and surviving.The Dancer Upstairs' written by Nicholas Shakespeare from his novel is a delicate dance of intrigue whose rewards are waiting for those who wait to find out that The fourth stage of communism is just a big fat man in a cardigan.'".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a dark terrible sometimes dry sometimes oversaturated view of a story from an aloof but vulgar perspective. I'm sorry Mr. Malkovich but it at least failed in the edit. Apologetically it could have been a technical constraint but the cinematography was often too tight leaving the viewer with tunnel vision in the attempt to share the actors' scenes. The story was also zeroed in on a narrow slice of the subjects' history so that it was difficult to connect with the characters. The exposition of the thriller plot was too disconnected and I found myself not caring how things ended up. I was searching for the dimension of the film that received the most artistic attention.What this movie triumphed in as I was able to appreciate was costume. I never had any trouble figuring out why anyone was where they were in a shot doing whatever they were doing because the costume told me who they were and the connections were seamless in that dimension. Also the cinematography at times was too gorgeous. Making a trailer would be easy work. The dull points starkly bored me and the rich points overwhelmed me. The depiction of violence was appropriately disturbing. The lack of any real character development was disheartening. The dullness of the nonviolent shots made me wonder if Malkovich had a clear idea of how to expose anything else in the story.Maybe part of his intention was to dehumanize everyone a little bit so that the viewer could struggle for a sense of compassion for the characters but there wasn't enough going on in every scene and I failed to suspend my disbelief that these were real people experiencing real drama. I saw beautiful actors acting beautifully but I didn't feel involved. As a viewer I felt separated from the story like I was on the outside looking in with bad seats wondering if I just missed something. There's good stuff to see but it doesn't hold together.Give me more medium shots and pan around the set so I can get more of the characters' perspectives to establish each set. Tell me more about the people involved in the drama. Show me how the drama is changing those characters. Give me more but the costume casting setting and some of the arty shots like the dancer between the opposing mirrors and the cutaways of the first hanging dog discoveries were all just right. Don't overdo any of that stuff.".

	schema:reviewBody "A classic case of undue hype.  It's difficult to itemize all the different ways that Malkovich blew it.      The film is not dramatically gripping at all. Most of the scenes are night scenes or otherwise shot in darkness probably so as to look arty but not throw too much light on the directors ineptitude. One of the central characters Yolanda appears to be in some conflict about the police investigator's romantic interest in her but the nature of the conflict is not dramatically sensible even at the end. The ditzy glamorobsessed wife is just that  a stereotype of a glitzy glamorobsessed wife. In fact most of the characters are just cardboard caricatures. The gratuitous scenes of gory mayhem are indeed just gratuitous scenes of gory mayhem.  I have no problem at all with violence in films.  But Malkovich is just cynically tossing off stuff that he thinks is shocking. How the hell did he find a leading man chosen because he looks like a perfectlycoifed Raoul Julia?  And why do we need that? Come to think of it has there ever been a police character in any movie with such dark pits of sunken eyes as that police chief? The investigator gets a note from Yolanda at the end and rushes off in his car.  Directed to act heartbroken by a stunned look and doelike eyes he ends up confirming that the dramatic theme is his infatuation with his own daughter. Uh huh. Deep. Let's get back to Malkovich.  This is making me nauseous all over again like after leaving the movie.  John really ought to stay in his place as a weird fascinating screen presence himself. In interviews he has virtually bragged about how much stage directing experience he has.  God bless you John. And John I know you are reading this because you are too much of an egomaniac not to read it. But you sold and pushed a really cheesy attempt at directing a film drama and somehow got people to market it with colossal hype. Frankly I'd offer this up to Crow and Tom Servo if they were still at it.By the way there is a cute little scene in the middle of the movie. Traffic is all congested after a terrorist attack.  In the middle of the traffic chaos is what appears to be the local schizophrenic gesturing absurdly like a traffic cop.  Notice the size and body.  We can't see his face because of a funny hat.  I'd bet a box of donuts that Malkovich thought auteur touch! that he should put himself in a little walkon cameo with the joke that he is directing in the center of all the complexity around him.".

	schema:reviewBody "Soviet cinema and other art forms spent 70 years mythologising the Russian Civil War of 19181921 with special attention paid to creating Bolshevik heroes galore and demonising their opponents of all stripes. The cinematically tiresome and historically ludicrous results are still showing on Russian television and will likely be for decades which makes one wonder what children growing up without ever having known the Soviet Union can possibly make of them. Why they must ask themselves are the Bolsheviks still heroes on TV when we know they weren't in history? A film like Gospoda Ofitsery Spasti Imperatora Officers and Gentlemen To Save the Emporer makes a modest contribution toward redressing the balance. It's far from great cinema it is instead cinema that tries hard if you will to entertain and deideologise at the same go. Here and there it succeeds. It clearly had a respectable budget and some moderately wellknown actors plus a special effects unit that could do a creditable job with battles scenes and explosives.The plot involves a commando group of officers detailed to save the lives of the imprisoned Romanov family. There are several sequences which tell a good story in themselves but the whole of the film is really not impressive or sustained moviemaking. Briefly put the signal virtue of this production is its point of view the heroes are the actual good guys and the villains the actual bad guys. And in the context of Russian historyaspresentedinthecinema that counts for a good deal.One hopes that another Russian Civil War blockbuster Kolchak  due to be released shortly  can add rather more to this step in the right direction.".

She was different in each one. Bette Davis had such a distinctive personality that it would be easy to think she just played herself in film after film but not so. Her Rosa Moline in Beyond the Forest is a oneoff I don't think she ever played any other role that way again. Some say she was sending herself up. Apparently she didn't want to play the part and maybe her bad mood helped shape her character.I couldn't help thinking of Madam Bovary as I watched this film about a woman who leaves her husband to chase her dream. In Madam Bovary's case the dream was a romantic one in Rosa's the dream is more superficial in both cases the dream turns into a nightmare.Rosa is married to the nice Doctor Lewis Moline Joseph Cotton but to her he is just poor and boring. Lewis is the respected doctor in the Wisconsin mill town where they live. Rosa latches onto Neil Latimer David Brian a rich businessman from Chicago and plans to dump Lewis. He is about the only person in town who can't see through her even their young Indian maid Jenny Dona Drake has her measure. The scenes between Rosa and Jenny are very funny  the film needed a light touch to relieve the angst. It all ends in tears of course played out in the flickering light of the massive incinerator that dominates the town.Bette Davis thought she was too old for the part but doesn't that make her character just that much more pathetic? She feels life has passed her by and she is making a last desperate grab for what she thinks she deserves.Much of the film was shot on location and has a rich look. Max Steiner contributed a powerful score incorporating the melody Chicago the theme for Rosa's yearning. His music actually has sympathy for Rosa it understands her even as it accompanies her to the inevitable tragedy.Beyond the Forest is a movie where everything is larger than life including the emotions. I still think it is fantastic cinema.".

Bette Davis plays Rosa Moline a small town strumpet who wants more than her hick doctor hubby can provide.Bette's explosive performance is among the best of her careerand that's saying something!. Her character has to be among the most evil in motion picture history. What is remarkable is that Bette compels us to care about and even root for this greedy and self centered woman. That is part of what makes Bette Davis the most versatile and most accomplished actress in motion picture history.A particularly wonderful scene takes place later in the film. Rosa gives her husband a surprising bit of news at a picnic. Watch the sadness and mixed emotions that emanate from her eyes. What an amazing and bittersweet scene.The problem with the film is that there are scenes that don't fully detail what happens to Rosa near the end of the film. Also there were changes imposed on the film by the production code that weakened its narrative logic.Despite a few flaws this is a fabulous film. The highs and lows of Rosa Moline are compelling and complex. Like the sinister character Bette Davis portrays the film is far deeper than it seems. Those who think of it only as camp should take a closer look.".

	schema:headline " Bette Davis' most underrated film";
	schema:reviewBody "Bette Davis gave many great performances but she did not make many great films or work with many truly great directors with the exception of William Wyler  Joseph L. Mankiewicz. King Vidor ranks as one of Bette Davis' greatest directors and Beyond the Forest is her most underrated film another underrated film is The Private Lives of Elizabeth  Essex directed by the superb technician Michael Curtiz. The eminent film critic Pauline Kael wrote that there's not a sane dull scene in this peerless piece of camp. And I agree that this film is never boring. It has elements of film noir melodrama comedy and stands the test of time as it is not sentimental like so many of Bette's soap operas The Great Lie is a great bore. I challenge anyone to watch this film and be bored by it. Impossible. It starts off slowly but after the first 20 minutes it is compulsively watchable a hoot! And although Bette in her later years said she loathed this film it is clear that she relished the part of Rosa Moline and was living the part as she played it. She poured into the part all of the frustration  fury with Jack Warner and the studio for giving her bad roles  bad scripts her own fears of aging after she had her baby and she was no longer box office and all the emotional turmoil both the sexual electricity  the physical  verbal abuse of her marriage to William Grant Sherry. Ruth Roman who played a small role in this film said that she watched Bette on set and it was all too REAL for her that she was terrified of Bette. And indeed this is one of Bette's most real performances however over the top it may be. Rosa Moline is a precursor to Margo Channing in All About Eve yet I find Beyond the Forest more interesting because King Vidor is more of a stylist than Joseph L. Mankiewicz. All About Eve is theatrical not cinematic Beyond the Forest is pure cinema. Savor every frame of this fading femme fatale in this film noir farce. You will laugh at Rosa be moved by her feel sorry for her but ultimately admire her for her courage pride  determination. She was just a dame who was trying to get out of her own personal prison  hell.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beyond the Forest is finally getting the respect it's always deserved. A number of film historians are finally appraising this masterpiece as the work of art it is. Thanks to its phenomenal star Bette Davis this King Vidor production has had to struggle with a bad reputation since it was first seen back in l949. Davis was going through a breakdown she hated her studio her marriage was dead and Jack Warner finally kicked her ass off the Warner lot. Forever after Davis always slammed everything about Beyond the Forest and people who never even saw it joked about it and tore it to pieces. Especially the gay crowds. When I saw Beyond the Forest at the old Regency Theater here in Manhattan back in the 80s no one could enjoy it since the gaggle of screeching queens ruined it for everyone by camping it up. Davis' inner turmoil and fury is what makes Rosa Moline literally seethe with fury bristling with electricity in her greatest role. No other major star would have taken the risks that Davis does. As to the many comments about her black wig makeup clevage. This is how smalltown women tried to look during that era. The Maria Montez look. I remember this from my small Southern town. All women dyed their hair black grew long tresses etc. Max Steiner's musical score is among his greatest next to another masterpiece that Bette always put down the l942 In This Our life.Davis' role is among the greatest ever put on screen. She displays her genius here like never before.  To those who like to be clever and cute and view this gem as camp get a life. Davis is at her most brilliant.  She nearly matches her brilliant portrayal of a psychopathic Southern Belle Stanley Timberlake in the great In This Our Life. Bravo to Bette! To new viewers watch it alone without the wisecracks giggles and smart inside jokes. Warner Brothers did itself and its great star proud.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beyond The Forest drags around a reputation as one of the alltime stinkers a reputation that's far from deserved but not hard to understand.  This is the movie whose name Martha in Edward Albee's play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf can't remember after she quotes the emblematic line What a dump.' Thrown away by Bette Davis the line got parodied as high camp by Elizabeth Taylor in the play's screen version.  It also fell at a time when Davis' best work was thought to be well behind her and when she was labeled difficult' a year before All About Eve gave her career a booster shot.And to be fair there are aspects of the movie itself a lurid and overwrought drama that account for some of the scorn that's been heaped upon it.  Married to impoverished physician Joseph Cotton in a grim Wisconsin factory town Davis as Rosa Moline chafes against the boredom of her life and craves romance adventure bigcity life as exemplified by Chicago just a short trainride away.  That's where bigshot David Brian lives the high life but now and then visits a hunting lodge in the woods where he caught Davis' eye. She's just another notch on his bedpost but she's convinced herself he'll hand her the life of her fantasies.  The plot cooks up a witch's brew of adultery abortion and murder. But director King Vidor does well with the overripe material which smacks of midcentury regional' literature.  Though Davis' long black wig is a sight for sore eyes it's entirely in character for the slutty Rosa with longings above her breeding.  When she finally travels to the Big Town Vidor turns it into a tense yet poignant cinematic vignette.Admittedly there are weaknesses the big murder trial seems irrelevant even in this farfetched plot and both Cotton and Brian get elbowed offscreen by the volcanic Davis.  But Beyond the Forest's operatic ending more than compensates for the movie's faults.  Greasyfaced and stragglehaired guzzling pitchers of water and sweating like a stuck pig Davis dying and delirious from peritonitis that botched operation rouses herself for one last trip to Chicago.  Kicking away her native American maid she slaps on her makeup and finery and staggers down to the railroad tracks where the approaching train whistles its siren song of Chicago Chicago.'  Alas poor Rosa Moline dies like a dog face down in the mud as it passes her by.  It's an eyepopping goforbroke performance and maybe only Davis at this desperate juncture in her stardom could have brought off this Liebestod.".

Nineteen fortynine was the year of the desperate housewife in Hollywood in addition to Bette Davis  Jennifer Jones there's also Audrey Totter in TENSION and Lizabeth Scott in TOO LATE FOR TEARS postwar noir women who expect and demand a better life and plan to achieve it by any means necessary. Forty yearold Bette Davis with her lowcut peasant blouses long black wig and carmine lips is unquestionably miscast but like the film itself that actually works in a perverted sort of way.

Still the movie also has its amusing aspects and you can't help but smile as Rosa sashays down the street and all the men stop and stare. How could a pastherprime dimestore siren like that keep Joseph Cotten and David Brian in such thrall? Why sex of course. Rosa no doubt did things in bed they couldn't get enough of much like the hold Wallis Simpson had over the Duke of Windsor. The crime of Rosa Moline was similar to that of Phyllis Hochen in THE UNHOLY WIFE desperate for a way out she ends up shooting her husband's best friend and from the overblown opening prologue scroll to the mounting hysteria and rampant symbols of Hell that culminate in a shocking conclusion Vidor's Bovary casts a spell as well.

	schema:reviewBody "It was interesting seeing this soon after seeing The Man Who Wasn't There the Coen brothers wouldbe 40s filmnoir. Both movies are set in small towns have wayout plots involving violent crime and illicit love and feature main protagonists trying to get out of a rut. But whereas the Coens' nouveaunoir plays it deadpan philosophical and slow and thereby risks boring the audience stiff the genuine article with King Vidor at the helm races along goes way over the top and glues the viewer to the screen.

This film has genuine substance and potency and Hedda Gablerlike Rosa's nearhysterical exasperation with the suffocating small town atmosphere  symbolised by the everpresent smoke and dust from the local sawmill  and with her dull worthy medico husband Joseph Cotton must have rung a bell with many American and other women in the stifling postwar years. Her What a dump! quite probably echoed their inner thoughts as may her reluctance to have a baby contrasted in the film with another woman's eighth delivered by the good doctor. Moreover despite Davis playing a woman at least 10 years younger than her actual age her scenes with David Brian as her wealthy lover are truly erotic and some of the lines may raise eyebrows even today.Those who dismiss this film should perhaps give it another chance try to place it in the context of its era and possibly ponder on how some of the cool masterpieces of today will be viewed by their grandchildren in 50 years time.".

And this one delivers on that Bette expectation. In the first five minutes of the story itself you see her fake a sprained ankle. You wonder why. Duh  she's preparing for major psycho witchiness of exponentially increasing proportions! And I have to say that this one beats most of her other great roles in at least that category  and in the category of making the psychoness tragically necessary right from the first minute. Yes many parts of this movie are over the top melodrama. But HERE COMES THE SPOILER Despite my status as a vehement prolifer and Catholic I was so taken into Bette's performance that when it looked like her dream of minks and diamonds was going to be thwarted by her secret pregnancy I found myself thinking Noooo Bette you HAVE to find some way to get an abortion! And then I found myself smacking myself on the head. But really by that point when I had already forgiven her for Nother Spoiler totally murdering another person already it was like what's one more life sacrificed to her dreams? So when an actress can make an evil character compelling enough to make the audience root for her to kill people I would hesitate before calling her a bad actress. Bette is the best!".

A moralist intertitle announcing we're going to see a film about naked evil. Religious King Vidor at the helm. Omniscient narrator hovers around town setting up the story.But this is Bette's show as well. Reportedly she was disdainful of the script and tried to walk out several times. I don't know if you can tell by watching that she hates it the Bette Davis devout might I haven't had the chance to watch her in a while. She's always so eminently watchable however and no less here sneering and scoffing her way through the role of contemptible manipulatrix tormenting her milquetoast doctor husband.She is the 'evil' of the intertile her naked lust for money her haughty ego that she's too good for the small Wisconsin town. Her burning desire and ego are visually exemplified in the fire of a nearby sawmill that burns through the night visible from her window. She writhes and winces a lot a picture of someone completely at odds with themselves. In a most heinous moment of the story she calls in her husband's medical debts from the poor workers in town all so she can go to Chicago to buy clothes. Once there she hopes to elope with a rich guy.It's all as incorrigible as this. But this is Bette's show which means a struggle with the fire that burns inside of you a struggle to harness explosive talent. What does this mean?This is the film where she famously says 'what a dump'. A more fiery moment however for me is when she demands from the rich guy to marry her. She wants out of the dump badly. Rich guy raucously laughs and points at her laughing. Is Bette phased at all? She crosses the room and slaps him hard and cut to her looking triumphant. He kisses her.The film is about a headstrong woman who is unhappy with where she is in life. Written as it is by some guy in the 40s the film goes out of its way to portray her as truly vile not just an unhappy wife but unhappy because she can't buy nice shoes and clothes. Fierce but deliberately shown as idle and superficial. But what if we decide to not settle for the cartoon manipulatrix grafted on top of the unhappy woman and instead see someone who wants out from a role she has been squeezed into?Being a headstrong woman who wants to be in control of her own choices was enough to label you spoiled and ungrateful in the 40s.

Metaphors are rife to run in conjunction with the psychological imbalance of Rosa's mind be it the mill furnace that lights up the sky at frequent intervals or the steam locomotive that thunders through the centre of town to take folk off to the big city of Chicago the aural smarts are superbly inserted by Vidor.Using flashback as a starting point Vidor firmly enters a noir realm which continues throughout as he is aided considerably by Burks' photography. One of Hitchcock's main cinematographers of choice it's a real pity that Burks didn't get hired for more noir ventures in the 50s. His work here is superb low lights and side lights come to the fore in the final third as the femme fatale axis of story reaches a potent finale.

	schema:reviewBody "And although I know this was written based on a novel of the same name beyond what forest? The film starts with a voiceover describing the town of Loyalton Wisconsin and the fact that an inquest is going on concerning the death of a man killed by Rosa Moline Bette Davis. She claims it is an accident. You do get from the introductory narration that this is a town where everybody derives their income from the sawmill and that Rosa is an insufferable snob. What you don't know is who it is that Rosa has killed  accidentally or on purpose. Then comes the rest of the movie in flashback.Rosa is very unhappily married to Lewis Moline MD Joseph Cotten. Before I watched this I thought who would be unhappy being married to handsome Joseph Cotten? But he plays this as such a doormat a guy who is OK with patients who never pay him who gives in to every expensive thing that Rosa wants that it is no wonder Rosa has no respect for him. Fine acting from Mr. Cotten to play this as such a weak milquetoast of a guy. So Rosa lusts after the wealthy Neil Latimer David Brian from Chicago who has a hunting lodge near Loyalton. He's a strong self made man and that and the money draw Rosa to him and into an affair. If she knew that David Brian would play a character who beats the living daylights out of Joan Crawford the following year I'm sure that wouldn't have hurt either but that's another story.So Rosa's dilemma is how to get out of this marriage and get Neil to care enough about her to marry her. What she does to accomplish this and the problems and twists and turns of the plot that crop up along the way constitute the rest of the film and eventually bring us full circle back to the inquest.Why do I say it seems that Jack Warner was trying to get rid of Bette Davis with this film? It's not so much her acting  she is as good as she ever was  but she is playing a woman about ten years younger than she looks especially with the tight fitting clothes that show every inch of extra avoirdupois that she is sporting plus a ridiculous long black wig. And then there is the dialogue. Every time somebody suggests that Rosa do something that she feels is beneath her Rosa retorts I would never do THAT I'm Rosa Moline. How odd. The whole film is about how much she does not want to be a Moline yet she seems to proudly hail it as part of her identitiy. There is a ridiculous scene with Lewis talking to an unconscious woman about her blood and why did Rosa build her house as far from the center of town as possible but position the master bedroom such that the flames shooting from the sawmill incinerator in the middle of the night glow through the window and even the shades and keep her awake? Rosa is a poor architect of her house and her life. I could go on forever with what is weird about this film but the acting is quite good and the story is so weird that the camp actually becomes one of its strengths. I'd suggest it if you can ever find a copy.".

The only clue linking the victims is that all of them were in the services of a shady and unconventional therapist named Dr. Sara Lee Jaffee Famke Janssen who may know a lot more than what she is telling. Dietz and his new detective partner Jessica Parreti Colleen Coffey think there is a link between Dr. Jaffee's therapy sessions and the murder victims when they learn that all of them had a neardeath experience in the past. On the home front the recently widowed Dietz struggles to raise his teenage son Cory Christopher Pettiet on his own and deals with the troubled teenager slacking off in school abusing drugs and carousing with a local and similarly troubled teen girl.";

In Relentless IV Ashes to Ashes Dietz and fellow detective Jessica Parretti get involved in a homicide case which leads them to Dr. Sara Lee Jaffee a psychologist who has an off screen history with Dietz. From here on in a bizarre series of events follows as Dietz and Parretti try to solve the case while Dietz also deals with his now teenage son who is doing some growing up. As the plot thickens and Dr. Jaffee's connections to the murderer are revealed the final climatic showdown is a thrilling and tense tearjerker.While Ashes to Ashes which gets its name from the climatic finale is a great often quirky film it is certainly not without it's faults. The production values seem quite low and there is a Telemovie quality about it. Also Leo Rossi isn't the most appealing of all heroes. He seems to rely more on his comic skills which at times are just not funny although perhaps those who have seen the previous three films might be able to appreciate his character more. Colleen Coffery is undervalued as Jessica Parretti but she has some good moments. Christopher Petit RIP takes over the role of Dietz's teenage son Corey and hottie John Meyers has a small role as a murder suspect.But of course it is Famke Janssen who is the real reason anyone would watch Relentless IV Ashes to Ashes as she proves why she has always been such a terrific actress even in her early films. Her character of Dr. Sara Lee Jaffee may not be as highprofile as Jean Grey or Xenia Onatop but she is a fun character and the ending is very sad. For fans of Famke in particular Ashes to Ashes is certainly worth a watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Veteran L.A. homicide detective Sam Dietz series star Leo Rossi in excellent form is once again working the case of a serial killer. Here his partner is a sexy young woman appealingly and sassily played by Colleen Coffey. And the killer is a p.o.s. who's targeting the patients of a psychiatrist played by Famke Janssen Jean Grey in the XMen franchise. The victims may have something in common but the psycho always changes the method of murder utilizing death rituals from different cultures. And Sam must also deal with a rebellious teen aged son Christopher Pettiet who disrespects him.Written by Mark Sevi and directed by Oley Sassone Relentless IV Ashes to Ashes the fourth and final entry in this series doesn't do much to stand out from the very large pack of Cop vs. Killer movies that are out there. There are certainly some interesting touches particularly a development late in the game that gives Dietz an entirely new perspective. Also there is quite a bit of banter between Dietz and his partner and one can't help but be amused as he doesn't even try to hide his attraction to both her and the shrink.The scenes with the son are some of the meatier in this series and underappreciated character actor Rossi makes the most of the material. For whatever flaws he might have Dietz IS dedicated to his job and is trying to do the best he can as a single father.The movie is noteworthy for being a very early acting credit for former model Janssen her second feature in fact albeit a straighttovideo one.

	onyx:emotionText "Veteran L.A. homicide detective Sam Dietz series star Leo Rossi in excellent form is once again working the case of a serial killer. Here his partner is a sexy young woman appealingly and sassily played by Colleen Coffey. And the killer is a p.o.s. who's targeting the patients of a psychiatrist played by Famke Janssen Jean Grey in the XMen franchise. The victims may have something in common but the psycho always changes the method of murder utilizing death rituals from different cultures. And Sam must also deal with a rebellious teen aged son Christopher Pettiet who disrespects him.Written by Mark Sevi and directed by Oley Sassone Relentless IV Ashes to Ashes the fourth and final entry in this series doesn't do much to stand out from the very large pack of Cop vs. Killer movies that are out there. There are certainly some interesting touches particularly a development late in the game that gives Dietz an entirely new perspective. Also there is quite a bit of banter between Dietz and his partner and one can't help but be amused as he doesn't even try to hide his attraction to both her and the shrink.The scenes with the son are some of the meatier in this series and underappreciated character actor Rossi makes the most of the material. For whatever flaws he might have Dietz IS dedicated to his job and is trying to do the best he can as a single father.The movie is noteworthy for being a very early acting credit for former model Janssen her second feature in fact albeit a straighttovideo one. She is VERY easy to watch and like Rossi has some effective moments as a character who is hiding some big secrets.The supporting cast also includes John Scott Clough as the killer and he just can't compare to William Forsythe in the third movie or even Judd Nelson in the first at this time this viewer hasn't seen the second entry in the series.

So when he hears from his friend Vijay Rao about his fabulous life in Manhattan with a penthouse apartment and Mercedes Ramu decides to move from his home in Delhi to the US to live with Vijay as he pursues his dream of being a star. Upon his arrival in Manhattan Ramu learns that Vijay's life is nothing like he mentioned he driving a cab and living in a run down cramped top floor apartment with two fellow South Asian roommates Ramu who would be the fourth in the apartment. Ramu nonetheless just wants a chance to prove himself in the entertainment business. Among Ramu's many missteps include stumbling into the porn movie business where he can't get it up in such a setting anyway and working as a waiter at least to earn some money.

Directed by Daisy von Scherler Mayer 1998 Madeline the movie stars Jimi Mistry as Ramu Gumpta an young Indian man that moves to America in hopes of obtaining the American dream that of fame fortune and celebrity.  His hopes are soon dashed however when he realizes that the land of opportunity is not awaiting his presence with open arms and he must find work as a waiter and then a reluctant actor in porn films in order to pay his quarter of the rent.  As chance would give Ramu finds himself at an upper class house party where a guru has been hired as the entertainment.

But alas all is not well in guru land.

Later Ramu must is put in a wecanseethiscomingamileaway' scene where his teachings to a mass audience are witnessed by Sharona and he must try to win her back after betraying her trust.The Guru is very light entertainment but it delivers by offering nothing more than a few laughs and musical numbers that will have your feet tapping the floor.  There are plenty of ethnic jokes and stereotypes Indians driving cabs ha ha but nothing offensive or off color.  Daisy von Scherler Mayer keeps things lively by providing us with just the right amount of sex music and humor to keep us enthralled. The Guru is by far a perfect movie and a 7 out of 10 would be about the proper rating if I was asked to rate it on such a scale but considering the amount of comedies out there and the lack of laughs they provide I think you will agree that The Guru will at least keep a smile on your face for 90 minutes.

	schema:reviewBody "THE GURUI had seen this around on DVD before but not really showed any interest. I am not a Bollywood fan and the cover of this film makes it look very Bollywood. But even though there are a few elements to Bollywood in there it is not Bollywood.The movie is about an Indian guy who leaves India to pursue a career as a Hollywood actor. When he moves to the USA he gets a break in the movie industry by starring in a porn film this doesn't work out but he does form a friendship with a porn actress who takes him under her wing and helps him get into the porn industry little does she know that the information she is giving him he is using to trick everyone into thinking he is a Love Guru. People are listening to his advice and he starts getting recognised for it.This is a romantic comedy but not like many others. The story is really well written. It has the typical elements of all romantic comedies but this has a fresh feel to it. The comedy is well done but not really laugh out loud. There were a few moments which I did laugh to but generally the film was just amusing and fun.The characters were really well played out. The characters were believable and also likable. Sometimes I find that in these films the characters can just be annoying and not really well done. I like to connect with the characters in the film and in this it was good. The main character was played by Jimi Mistry. He was very good in this film and I am surprised that he gave up the big movie dream to end up in Coronation Street. I thought he was better than that. Other great performances in this were by Heather Graham and Marisa Tomei. Heathers character was just complicated. Her character was just very weak and seemed confused. Marisas character was just annoying but not in a bad way. She played the part well and had some very funny moments.There were a couple of funny musical numbers in this movie. They were unexpected and seemed out of place but somehow worked really well. It added the Bollywood feel to the film and did make me laugh. The only part that I thought was a little out of place and did not belong in the film was the very last scene. The last scene really had me scratching my head as to what was going on. It didn't make sense and didn't belong in the film. I didn't get it.It was an entertaining film and a lot better than I thought it would be. I will give this film 7 out of 10.I talked to a real live pornstar... and she sounded naked!for more reviews please like my Facebook pagehttpswww.facebook.compagesOrdinaryPersonMovie Reviews456572047728204?refhl".

For those thinking this is simply an attempt at Bollywood trying to go mainstream it's more than that. It's a comedy love stories satire and selfhelp all rolled into one. The entire cast does a great job turning a trite farce into something more.One expects a little extra from the likes of Marisa Tomei Heather Graham and Christine Baranski and this film delivers. Baranski does a great job with what otherwise might be a forgettable role Tomei adds an intelligence to her character that might have been missed by other actors. Graham and Jimi Mistry are wonderful as the leads who both respectively lead double lives.".

The entire cast does a great job turning a trite farce into something more.One expects a little extra from the likes of Marisa Tomei Heather Graham and Christine Baranski and this film delivers. Baranski does a great job with what otherwise might be a forgettable role Tomei adds an intelligence to her character that might have been missed by other actors. Graham and Jimi Mistry are wonderful as the leads who both respectively lead double lives.";

It's almost like the template of romantic comedies has been strictly adhered to which has freed cast and writer up to just have a good time. And they do.

The basic story consists of a young Indian dance tutor who goes to America to realise his dream of becoming a movie star only to unwittingly become involved in the pornsex industry with some quite histerical consequences.I had read that the film was very funny and I have to wholeheartedly agree. The acting was spot on with Jimi Mistry making a good transition from small screen British soap to big screen box office. His timing and delivery was good and his face often bore a comic look that was difficult not to laugh at. Heather Grahams' character was a bit less believable but she made a very good job in the circumstances. She also wore a particularly hot black leather number in one scene which gave the film at least one extra mark in my opinion! The supporting actors again all did well and although the storyline wasn't particularly realistic this didn't really matter.What matters is that you go and see this movie with an open mind and make up your own opinion. In my opinion and that of my four friends who came with me it was a thouroughly enjoyable experience and the most that I've laughed out loud in the cinema for some time. There was even a smattering of impromptu applause at the end from a good proportion of the audience something almost unheard of from British moviegoers. Highly recommended 9 out of 10 for comedy value.".

The idea came to director Val Guest during the Cold War in 1954 and it is under that decade's spirit that the movie is better appreciated. I remember seeing it when it opened and I've never forgotten that experience specially its tinted sequence. Fortythree years later I am able to see it again and it's still the same notable film not the least affected by today's cinematic technology because in its core Guest's motivation the worry for the actions of mindless men who struggle to control the Earth is still relevant. If it's not highly regarded today as The Day the Earth Stood Still I think it has to do with the fact that Universal sold it as a B movie in America though not so by British Lion in the UK where it was a huge success and won the film industry's top prize for its screenplay and because not too many critics paid attention to it and wrote positive reviews establishing it as an important sciencefiction movie since then. Although there are very few reenacted disaster scenes and it relies upon footage of real catastrophes the tension is handled effectively in the newspaper's office where most of the action takes place with its overlapping dialogues and constant flow of new information and in the development of the romantic story in the midst of violence and terror in the streets. Edward Judd Janet Munro and Leo McKern contribute good performances to this fine movie shot in widescreen Dyaliscope.".

This has been caused by too much nuclear testing. As a result freak and unusual weather conditions are happening round the world including hotter than normal temperatures in the UK cyclones freak fog caused by the heat blizzards and tornado's.

To stop the Earth's journey towards the sun the USA and Russia explode the biggest nuclear bombs to date and if it that doesn't work Earth is certainly doomed... Through all of this one of the reporters falls in love.The scenes of the streets of London deserted the fog and the dried up Thames are very eerie.

Look out for Michael Caine as a policeman towards the end. You certainly cannot mistake that voice.This movie is a must see. Fantastic.Rating 4 and a half stars out of 5.".

	schema:headline " Lowtech but highquality filmmaking.";
	schema:reviewBody "What a pleasure to return by chance to an age of cinema when visual trickery emaciated plot and stereotypical noncharacters were not the norm! Scanning the shelves at the local video store recently I was beginning to get that insidious defeated feeling that I had seen everything of value these racks had to offer. Preposterous of course but you know that feeling I'm sure. All the covers begin to look the same. A scantily clad woman is superimposed about the gleaming barrel of a pistol or dead in a bathtub or held at knife point by a blood thirsty attacker who must surely deserve the disembowelling our hero has in store for him.I retreated into the Science Fiction area and found her again superimposed on the shiny barrel of a ray gun or  her space suit torn strategically to reveal sufficient flesh to attract the slobbering horned alien whose previous victim is still hanging in tatters from his blood stained fangs. Video viewers despair! I thought. We're finished. But wait! What's this? The Day The Earth Caught Fire. No monsters no murderers no aliens and no seminude victim. Hurray!I had seen this film on television twenty years ago when I could not really appreciate it but finding it on video started a nagging sensation at the back of my brain and I felt compelled to give it another adult viewing.The basic situation of the story the most improbable element of the film is that two nations have simultaneously detonated nuclear bombs in their Cold War induced  weapons testing  hysteria and have shifted the axis and orbit of the Earth with the result that the planet is headed for collision with the Sun. This premise unfolds gradually. Today we would be shown during opening credits a slick computer generated graphic of mushroom clouds and the Earth from space sailing through the cosmos toward destruction.It is of little significance that no such technology was available to this particular film maker in 1961. He would have had no use for it anyway. The film so cleverly acknowledges its limitations and adapts to them that it rises above its shortfalls and still delivers one of the most gripping and accessible science fiction stories on film.In his first leading role Edward Judd plays Peter Stenning a world weary  disenchanted newspaper reporter. Peter's once promising career is fading and he must be frequently rescued from dismissal by his older colleague Bill Maguire played with characteristic quality by veteran Leo McKern. Maguire like the custodial older brother often does double duty writing Stenning's articles for him while Peter dries out from a binge or rolls in late from an all night assignation with a young woman. At first these characters play as stereotypical and shallow. Peter smokes and drinks too much. Maguire is bored with his work and avoids his wife. But they are delivered so well and with such consistency by the actors and the dialogue that they quickly become familiar and tangible. This is aided further by the gradual unfolding of the narrative that they populate. We regard them as real people before we are invited to share in their crises.In a film whose resources are limited or whose writerdirector is really using their talents to the fullest the narrative must be treated as the most important element. We all crave story. No matter if we watch film to see the special effects or our favourite actors if the story is poor we feel it. How often do we enter a theatre with a feeling of nervous expectation and leave it with a vague undefinable yearning for something more?Val Guest produced directed and cowrote The Day The Earth Caught Fire. His single strongest effort here was in finding its point of view. It can not have been by accident that the main characters work for a newspaper. In 1961 newspapers were still the most widely used method of delivering current information. Like this film the most effective news story is not about actual events but the effects of each event on people. Guest recognised that The Day the Earth Caught Fire would be much more interesting as a story about the characters than one of atomic bombs or the mathematics of gravitational dynamics.Ironically narrowing the view to one newspaper office broadens the reach of the film. As it becomes known gradually that the Earth is not only leaning over at a greater angle than before but that it is also slipping out of its orbit around the sun the reporters and editors of the paper begin to show the stresses they share with the rest of the world. Their personal concerns begin to compete with their professional ones. We are hooked by our human connection to the characters and they keep us in the world of the film through their commitment to deliver to a news hungry public.With a sound film maker's instinct Guest places the camera and characters where drama is served best. The motif of limited access is one which builds tension toward the climax. Doorways seem forever blocked or locked. Characters are kept apart by walls doors or obstructions. Stenning frequently calls a broken elevator. Panicked crowds of weekend picnickers are turned away from a subway entrance by a police officer as thick fog envelopes England a side effect of violently changing global weather. In a fit of decorum while taking refuge at her flat during the fog Peter sleeps apart from Jeannie the object of his affections separated from her by a bathroom door. Guest keeps his characters and his audience deliciously unaware of critical information with the same instinct for suspense that characterises the films of Alfred Hitchcock or John Frankenheimer.The climax of The Day the Earth Caught Fire is one of its weaker components. Here Val Guest returned to the original flaw. He based the resolution of the story on the initial and improbable even to those with only a limited grasp of physics premise that Earth could be shifted in space by bombs detonated on its surface. But again he knows his strength. The film gives its attention to the stresses felt by the small group of familiar characters.Tensions grow as fresh reports of severe climatic changes and public distress filter in to the newspaper office. Finally and ironically Earth's only hope rests with the strategic detonation of further bombs to correct the orientation and orbit of the planet. Here again our distance from the critical events allow the film maker considerable power to hold the attention. We are shown the fear anxiety expectation of the entire planet through those we already know in London. As the time draws nearer to the detonation of the bombs characters begin to reevaluate their relationships and question the nature of their lives. Finally the climax is left to us. We decide what outcome we desire most or think the world deserves and if the film maker has done his job well as I believe he has we must be satisfied with the ending we choose.See it soon. See it before you watch the next slobbering demon from Planet X invade the space ship and devour the unsuspecting Earthlings. The Day The Earth Caught Fire will show how drama and character have a place in science fiction and how these are gravely absent from much of the science fiction films of today.".

A duo of Daily Express reporters discover with the help of a weather girl that the earth has been tilted off its axis because both the Russians and the Americans ignited their Hbombs simultaneously. The unusually high temperatures in Londen as well as other inexplicable weather phenomenons indicate that our planet is moving towards the sun very fast. Despite an obvious lack budget director Val Guest creator of other genre milestones such as The Quatermass Experiment and The Abominable Snowman did everything possible to make this film look like a captivating and paranoid drama. The images of a dying Londen enshrouded in fog and heat are truly atmospheric and there also are some very intelligent extra elements added like new epidemics as a result of water shortness. Surprisingly enough there's even room for an honest and credible for once lovestory between the cynical reporter and the overlyemotional weathergirl. Personally I didn't really like the ending but it does typify 60's cinema greatly. The acting performances are splendid with Leo McKern Xthe Unknown Edward Judd Island of Terror and the adorable Janet Munro former child star of Swiss Family Robinson. The Day the Earth Caught Fire is a vastly underrated SciFi gem probably because it wasn't a Hammer production and genre fans should urgently rediscover it. Highly recommended!".

Then there is an ending which I won't reveal that I'm sure will frustrate some viewers.

	schema:headline " Timeless compelling scifi drama";
	schema:reviewBody "After more than forty years this film is still a milestone in the science fiction genre. In its day it was years ahead of its time. It had characters that acted like real people instead of like John Agar and Lori Nelson. It contained a clearly implied sexual relationship between the two main characters in an era when filmmakers were still routinely depicting even married couples as sleeping in separate beds. It was filled with shocking insinuations that the government is not allwise and benevolent that science doesn't really have all the answers that the military is capable of blunders that put new meaning into the phrase friendly fire and that all may not be well after all.The film's greatest strength is in its understated matteroffact presentation of the characters' various reactions to the relentlessly deteriorating situation. The performances are consistently honest and compelling from the principal players down to the smallest walkon parts. The awardwinning script by Wolf Mankowitz is at times almost too clever for its own good. If there is one criticism that may be leveled against it it is that most real people are not that consistently witty. Occasionally they are at a loss for words. Occasionally they say things that are lame stupid and altogether inappropriate. And this is the one element that was pretty much absent from the dialogue.In an age when movies are being strangled to death by their own special effects and character development often does not extend beyond the crudest bodily functions and fourletter expletives it is genuinely refreshing to return to a film such as this one. Not only does it not rely on visual effects to tell its story it is really so little dependent on the visual that it could have been equally successful as a radio drama a forgotten art form nowadays and might very well have caused an even greater panic than Orson Welles' War of the Worlds.".

It had characters that acted like real people instead of like John Agar and Lori Nelson. It contained a clearly implied sexual relationship between the two main characters in an era when filmmakers were still routinely depicting even married couples as sleeping in separate beds. It was filled with shocking insinuations that the government is not allwise and benevolent that science doesn't really have all the answers that the military is capable of blunders that put new meaning into the phrase friendly fire and that all may not be well after all.The film's greatest strength is in its understated matteroffact presentation of the characters' various reactions to the relentlessly deteriorating situation.

The staggering opening tinted in reddish yellow and brilliantly composed in widescreen looks like Tarkovsky and Lars von Trier and has the same dry wasteland quality to it. Callous and unpublicized nuclear tests by both the Soviet Union and the US have upset the environment causing recordbreaking heat waves floods cyclones eclipses and what not and we gradually find out that Earth has tilted and is hurtling towards the Sun where in four months' time the universe will savor the delightful smell of charcoaled mankind as put by a cynical newspaperman. The largest nuclear bomb ever made will now be detonated in Siberia and no one knows what will happen now ... The environmentalist discourse seems extremely contemporary to us today.Now how to make intelligent thoughtful entertainment out of that pulp?! Leave it to writerdirector Val Guest who more than rose to the task. He put a heartbroken newly divorced and slightly alcoholized reporter in the center working for the London Daily News. He tries with his science editor and surrogate father to delve into what went wrong and who is responsible and he falls in love with a switchboard girl with a cleavage. All this to keep the movie grounded the drama realistic. All of this naturalistic drama is crossedited with stock newsreel footage of natural disasters and it works. It works supremely well and you are sucked into the action as the end of the world approaches.All the actors are brilliant not least Edward Judd as the main reporter cynical witty vulnerable.".

Director Guest had already dabbled in scifi and even then despite the fanciful plots concerned he gave it a ring of truth by approaching the genre more or less as semidocumentary this time however with paranoia about nuclear obliteration at its highest during the early 60s it seemed more feasible than ever before and that anything was possible! The opening and closing moments are orangetinted the rest of the story is told in monochromatic flashback in order to convey the tremendous heatwave which has enveloped Planet Earth  caused to spin off its axis by a number of simultaneous nuclear blasts!  on its way towards the Sun.The film also incorporates the human element in the form of a blossoming romance but given the appropriate tension by making it a lovehate relationship! between maverick reporter Edward Judd undergoing divorce proceedings from wife Renee' Asherson who turns up for a 30second bit! and spirited meteorological employee Janet Munro while both actors proved charismatic leads here playing very well off each other their careers faltered pretty quickly  Judd seemed to be typecast in scifi roles and was also something of a hellraiser while Munro unfortunately fell prey to alcoholism and died quite young!Leo Mc Kern is simply marvelous as the burly yet dynamic Science Correspondent of the Daily Express who sees his pragmatic theories about Armageddon which he still admits to being largely guesswork on his part realized to their most horrific extent and Arthur Christiansen EditiorinChief for many years of the real newspaper featured here actually brought in as technical adviser was persuaded to appear in it more or less as himself  which further adds to the film's striving for complete authenticity extending also to the meticulous recreation of Fleet Street  London's famous newspaper sector  on a studio set though some of it was shot on actual locations. All of this then is superbly captured by Harry Waxman's stark cinematography also though no official score for the film was composed sparse use is made of appropriately ominous library cues chosen by Stanley Black with the beatnik rhythms of one particular scene provided by Monty Norman who immediately afterwards became worldfamous for composing the James Bond theme!.

In fact what it really does is it stresses the human element. It might not be satisfactory to people who prefer less talk and more action but it gives us a bunch of engaging characters whom we can actually care about. The script by producer  director Val Guest  Wolf Mankowitz is often very witty and funny. Scenes of destruction are ultimately kept to a minimum.Edward Judd stars as reporter Peter Stenning who's first to break a critical story. Earth has been knocked off its axis by the Americans and Russians who performed atom bomb tests at roughly the same time. This causes much upheaval in the weather. Water evaporates and a strange mist covers Britain. However the characters won't be aware of just how bad the news is for a while and simply go about their daily business. Peter a divorced father of one begins romancing Jeannie Craig Janet Munro who becomes his contact.It's worth noting that this ends in a rather brave way forcing the audience to interpret things. It simply fades to black. The words The End don't even appear. The low key quality of the narrative works quite well and the actors are all just wonderful. Judd is a personable hero and the sadly short lived very lovely Munro is an endearing leading lady. Leo McKern delivers a delightful supporting performance as Peters' coworker Bill Maguire. Real life newspaperman Arthur Christiansen plays the role of editor Jeff Jefferson and that's a young Michael Caine as a cop directing traffic late in the film. The action is extremely well shot in Dyaliscope by Harry Waxman and viewers are advised to check out the full 99 minute version with very striking tinted opening and closing sequences.Very good of its type.Eight out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had to watch this one a couple of times to get my feelings straight on it. It's ostensibly a scifi thriller about the Earth being in peril from extreme weather conditions and a reporter's attempts to find out what's going on behind the official government line. It works well as scifi with good model work and excellent matte paintings depicting London undergoing extreme weather conditions. It's also nice to see a scifi film that isn't afraid of being clever where words like nutation aren't banned.But really I see it as the story of a man who has started to take two steps back for every one step forwards in life. He's distracted by his problems and so coasting at work putting his job in peril and he's lost his wife and child to a wealthy man. The peril of the Earth moves in tandem with the peril of his existence as an external manifestation of his stricken soul. The film is really about saving Peter Stenning. It's a lot easier to look at it this way when distanced in time from Christmas Island and the Tsar Bomba test.What's great about this movie is that it shows the value of friendship. Stenning's given life support by an older hack in the pressroom Bill Maguire in return for nothing. In these days of selfinterest when Kant is a mere ghost on a palimpsest it does me good to see an example of altruism. Moreso because I've had a similar situation at work where I was in a sort of existential agony and one of the older guys who has his own scars helped to put me back on the straight and narrow. He poured a lot of effort into this and only out of kindness.Hooray for The Day The Earth Caught Fire.".

The only real problem I have with this film is the dialogue. The actors are very well known and established but it seems as though they have to fill every second with rushed dialogue there are no spaces between lines. The newsroom scenes are the worst I know that in real life newsrooms can be quite busy but the rushed monotone ceaseless dialogue is annoying and seems quite amateur at times.".

	schema:headline " Great SF apocalypse film  short on FX but great on characterization suspense and dialog";
	schema:reviewBody "Overall this is a great SF movie a black  white gem that relies on a suspenseful story and fast dialog more than special effects which are used sparingly no doubt in part due to budgetary reasons.  There are a few things that detract from it It could have been done better from a science angle often surrendering to popularity by simplifying most of the explanations to crude ofteninaccurate layman's terms.  Also the scientific feasibility of the cause of such a disaster is extremely suspect. In addition the title of the film seems inept something more artfully apocalyptic and less campy would have been nice.  Finally the obligatory romance subplot while a fairly good one hinders the suspenseful pacing of the film and lessens its overall impact as another reviewer here pointed out.The sheer amount of dialog requires that you pay attention much more than you would in a film such as Deep Impact.  Sometimes the actors seem to be rushing the words out just to squeeze them all into the time allotted. Journalists are often very glib so maybe this is an accurate portrayal.SPOILERS BELOWOn the bright side it gives a gritty depressingly realistic depiction of the faltering of civilization as it heads toward its final demise.  Its cynical view of governments and even the press is refreshingly realistic. The film is quite reminiscent of Forge of God and Lucifer's Hammer though it is as a whole less compelling than those famous novels.  For me the most haunting words are spoken at the beginning and the end pure poetryWithin the next few hours the world will know if this is the end or another beginning the rebirth of man or his final obituary.  For the last time man pursued his brother with a sword and so the final fire was kindled.  The Earth that was to live forever was blasted by a great wind toward oblivion.'So man has sown the wind and reaped the world.  Perhaps in the next few hours there will no remembrance of the past and no hope for the future that might have been.  All the works of man will be consumed in the great fire after which he was created.  But perhaps at the heart of the burning light into which he has thrust his world there is a heart that cares more for him than he has ever cared for himself.'And if there is a future for man insensitive as he is proud and defiant in his pursuit of power let him resolve to live it lovingly for he knows well how to do so.  Then he may say once more truly the light is sweet and what a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to see the sun.'I like to think this last sentence while literal is also a metaphor for the light of the spirit.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw The Day the Earth Caught Fire in 1961 when I was twelve. I was impressed even though the movie was a little talky. Most of the reason I went to see it was my interest in science fiction but I must admit I also had a crush on Janet Munro Disney's Swiss Family Robinson. I was very surprised what a sexy woman she had become.I waited several years after the DVD release hoping the movie would show up on ENCORE FLIX or Turner Classic Movies. When it did not I finally relented and bought the DVD. I'm glad I did as the movie is even better than I remembered. Since the plot summary at IMDb gives away the film's secrets it's not a spoiler to say the premise that simultaneous detonation of two nuclear superbombs could cause this type of calamity is a bit preposterous. After all at various times in history the earth has experienced asteroid collisions and supervolcanoes without these kinds of consequences. However the climatic effects are quite scientifically accurate and especially sobering given the virtually identical climatic phenomena which have occurred worldwide during the last decade.While the movie unfolds in a subtle almost semidocumentary style the crisp dialog and witty performances by Edward Judd Janet Munro and especially Leo McKern emphasize the human element. Director Val Guest never goes for sensationalism making the realism all that more unnerving.For those purchasing the DVD you should know among the extras is a photo gallery which contains two topless shots of Janet Munroe from one of the film's deleted scene. Whether this attracts or revolts you you have a right to know rather than stumbling across them.Beautifully produced directed photographed and acted The Day the Earth Caught Fire is clearly a 10 in my book.".

The actors are the stars of the day here. Edward Judd is excellent in his first major role. Janet Munro hot off a threepicture deal with Disney has a natural fresh beauty and handles the snappy dialog with keen skill. Leo McKern almost steals the the movie out from underneath the stars. Judd's character is portrayed as a heavy drinker who has trouble keeping up with his workload. McKern covers for him on more than one occasion. The scenes between Judd and Munro are simply magnificent and take on a prophetic and poignant epilogue. Sadly Munro in real life was the drunk and died before the age of forty from heart disease caused by alcoholism. Judd on the other hand is sober and still working. Leo McKern had a long and rewarding career which ended last year when he died. Ultimately I would not hesitate to show this movie to people who despise this genre. The movie is that good.".

In between you see the story unfolding from the viewpoint of a group of reporters. The overall effect is rather realistic as well as superdepressing. While other Earth in peril films have been made this is earlier and more intelligently made than most. The film has a few minor problems related to special effects but considering when it was made and its budget the film actually is remarkably good. Certainly not a feelgood movie but one that is very well presented. Some might hate the endingI thought it quite appropriate and well done though I did think the social chaos in the film was probably way understated if such a situation ever occurred.

	schema:reviewBody "Yes this is the typical 70's allstar disaster flick.  Though this one was made in 1980.  This one however was not a hit.  When The Towering Inferno was in theaters it made over 100 million at the box office.  When this one was at theaters it made less than 2 million.  Part of the problem is that it doesn't look much like a movie for the theater.  In fact when I first saw it I thought it was a made for television movie.  I think most of the budget in this one went to the stars and not nearly enough went into special effects.  The story in this one is typical of a volcano movie as it has someone trying to warn people that the volcano is going to erupt.  Of course no one believes them and then an eruption occurs.  We have people getting fried and a select group trying to head for safety.  Along the way they have to cross a bridge and it turns out there is someone who has a special ability to be put in use here like the character in The Poseidon Adventure who was an excellent swimmer.  This one has some good qualities though and if you have nothing else to do it may be worth a looksee but it is definitely nothing special.".

When the volcano finally blows its top a small group of hotel residents make a dangerous trek to higher ground but not all will survive as the peak spews smoke fire and lava across the island.This relaxed disaster movie signals the end of the first Golden Age of Disaster movies.  It is appropriate then that it was produced by Irwin Allen and recycles a variety of cliches that spanned the seventies.  When Paul Newman and Jacqueline Bisset start sipping wine on the beach with the volcano in the distance for example we know to start counting the minutes until the mountain blows.With both Paul Newman and William Holden playing roles very similar to those in The Towering Inferno it isn't difficult to draw parallels between the two movies.  The Towering Inferno however was a unique project involving a joint venture between two studios a huge budget an allstar cast and a blockbuster script culled from the best elements of two popular novels. Does When Time Ran Out represent what we should expect from Irwin Allen when all of the cards AREN'T stacked in his favor?When Time Ran Out harkens back to the dramaheavy days of the original Airport with a web of infidelity that will make your head spin.  Battle lines are quickly drawn between the defensive developer of the island Franciscus and a renegade oil driller Newman who believes the mountain is as he puts it a powder keg.'Occasional visits to the volcano's crater provide distraction while the relationships between the characters are cultivated for the disaster. The oilman stirs up trouble when he wants to see for himself that the mountain is safe before drilling in a highpressure oilfield.  However it's just ridiculous to think that his inspection would involve stepping into a laughable protective capsule and being lowered inside the smoldering volcano.  Naturally the capsulewith a glass floor!experiences a series of unexplained malfunctions that send him hurtling towards bubbling lava at the bottom of the crater.It's the kind of special effect that Irwin Allen was famous for from his television days on The Time Tunnel and elsewhere.  But the silver screen requires a much greater level of believability than is needed by television. When Time Ran Out contains some of the worst effects in the history of the genreimages which aren't even acceptable for the SMALL screen.  What happened to the Master of Disaster?When Time Ran Out is heavy on talk before the volcano erupts but the runaway action we were expecting during the buildup simply never arrives. Only two action sequences occur with the Newman followers and they both involve a large group of people taking a very long time to cross a treacherous path to safety.  It's a snoozefest all around.The special effects are hohum even though Irwin Allen attempts to diversify the experience with flaming meteors fired from the volcano and a tidal wave that inexplicably levels part of the same island whose shock wave created it!  They're not enough.  Most of the visuals are clearly preexisting volcano footage placed on a chromakey in front of the actors. And the rest of the eruption footage appears to be poorly executed postproduction animation.The lush tropical setting is a refreshing change of pace for most disaster movies and Jacqueline Bisset and Paul Newman try their best to keep things classy.  But an unnecessary cock fight in the village and a preposterous laboratory perched on the rim of the volcano immediately suggest that this movie needs a dose of realityand adrenalin.

	schema:reviewBody "WHEN TIME RAN OUT is a silly superficial and often cheesy coda to the cycle of disaster movies produced by Irwin Allen in the 1970s. As a huge fan of disaster movies I found myself enjoying this film a lot even if everything that happens has been done before and better. This film sees an allstar cast menaced by a volcano on an Pacific island and you can pretty much guess every plot point along the way if you've seen any of Allen's other earlier better disaster flicks.Still you can't say that Allen doesn't try his bestit's just that the budget or lack of it lets him down this time around. The volcano itself is a silly little miniature the rivers of lava are backprojected nonsense and the final 'disaster' scene at the hotel is so poor as to beggar belief. Even ignoring the belowpar special effects this film takes the biscuit. Although it's notably shorter than the likes of THE TOWERING INFERNO it takes half the running time for the volcano to actually blow and until that point we have lots of cheesy dialogue scenes involving romance between uninteresting characters.Thankfully things really get going once the disaster hits home as Allen throws tsunamis explosions cliffslides and whatnot into the mix. Twinklyeyed Paul Newman is on hand thankfully to take charge and act all manfully although he's up against a scheming James Franciscus as the island resort's owner who'll stop at nothing to protect his investments. Also caught up in the mix are the usual stereotypes doting or should that be dotty old timers step forward Burgess Meredith hardtimers Ernest Borgnine in his umpteenth disaster outing youthful beauties Barbara Carrera and Jacqueline Bisset the latter looking a bit off and even a few ethnic types too Pat Morita going Chinese. Much of the resultant running time follows Newman's group as they scramble for safety evading dangers along the way.It's no surprise as to who lives or dies but the 'obstacle' scenes are great fun especially the extended 'bridge crossing' which makes up the film's climax. And I'll never tire of those ultracheesy 'falling into lava' shots which are repeated at various intervals. It's just a shame that the volcano itself only has coming of a cameo appearance in the movie and that the characters are never menaced by ash clouds or falling lumps of pumicenow that would have been something to see!".

Sigh...reviewers can be so cruel. At least now I know that I have bad taste in movies so you can stop reading this now if you like.     There are a lot of familiar faces in the cast and they do a good job. This is my favorite Paul Newman movie by the way. But to be honest I don't watch many Paul Newman movies. Edward Albert is also great in it and even though his role is too small he does get to be heroic but don't blink or you will miss those moments. The women aren't given too much to do but aint that always the way it goes. Sigh again... I did like Veronica Hamel's little bitty role. She was classy but stupid. Should have hooked up with Edward Albert.    This movie is a great soap opera with love betrayal danger greed and a dastardly villain. Oh and the way some of the characters die is kinda funny. Sort of like every other disaster movie from the 70's and early 80's. So cut it a little slack why don't you.".

The women aren't given too much to do but aint that always the way it goes. Sigh again... I did like Veronica Hamel's little bitty role. She was classy but stupid. Should have hooked up with Edward Albert.    This movie is a great soap opera with love betrayal danger greed and a dastardly villain. Oh and the way some of the characters die is kinda funny. Sort of like every other disaster movie from the 70's and early 80's. So cut it a little slack why don't you.";

I'm a big fan and my heart goes out to the man retrospectively because he will have known from day one that he had become embroiled in the turkey of all turkeys. Almost every aspect of the film is woeful. The set the melodrama the 2dimensional characters the frankly appalling acting from almost everyone. Newman stands head an shoulders above the others but even he looks uncomfortable the whole way through as clich is piled on clich. Do you know the climax is an interminable crossing a wooden bridge over a lava flow with people falling through slats and every other predictable event you can imagine. But the funniest moment is after that when the survivors are in a cave and one of the female bit parts is standing there as if she's at a cocktail party.

	schema:reviewBody "You would think the setup of a volcano blowing up at a remote yet crowded location leaving a handful of survivors to fend for themselves until they can be safely rescued would be a good one. Unfortunately this movie shows just how poorly that premise can be executed.The plot  what there is of it  centers around a resort hotel located close to a picturesque and supposedly dormant volcano. The hotel is owned by successful businessman Shelby Gilmore William Holden and his greedy soninlaw Bob Spangler James Franciscus. Gilmore is openly disapproving of Spangler since he suspects that Spangler has only married his daughter Nikki Veronica Hammel in order to become his business partner and get his money. Gilmore's disapproval is justified by Spangler's affair with native Iolani Barbara Carrera. The other natives of the island those who don't work at the hotel seem to spend their time either cockfighting or drinking at a bar owned by Sam Pat Morita and Mona sheila Allen Irwin's wife a little nepotism here?. Gilmore is interested in Kay Kirby Jacqueline Bisset who is in turn interested in oil driller Hank Henderson Paul Newman. When the ground starts rumbling during drilling Henderson suspects their may be a problem with the supposedly dormant volcano so he goes to talk to the scientists who work at a lab precariously perched on the lip of the volcano. While there Henderson goes into the volcano in a gondola to inspect it and nearly gets dropped into the lava. Somehow he is able to see that eruption is imminent even though the head of the lab John Webster John Considine doesn't. Spangler doesn't want to cause a panic or lose money so he refuses to evacuate the hotel. While Henderson and Kirby are on a picnic the volcano blows up causing a tidal wave which wipes out half the island including the cockfighting population. The hotel guests are in a panic when Henderson and Kirby arrive back there as the volcano is spewing lava bombs at them. Once again Spangler refuses to evacuate and encourages the guests to sit tight. A small group which includes a private eye Ernest Borgnine and the thief he is trying to catch Red Buttons and a retired high wire walker Burgess Meredith and his wife Valentina Cortese decides to follow Henderson to higher ground to get away from the lava and we follow them for most of the rest of the movie with a break to watch the hotel get destroyed by a surprisingly accurate lava bomb.Clear as mud right. The writers tried to cram so many subplots into the movie that the result is a tangled mess. It's hard to tell who is who much less who is involved with whom. And that makes it hard to develop a sense of concern about their well being. You watch so many gratuitous characters die throughout the course of the movie that you are too numb to react to the deaths of the important ones. Simplifying things somewhat would not only have shortened a movie that seems tediously long but it would have helped to keep the viewer focused on the important characters.The writing also has a contrived feel to it relying so heavily on clichs that it becomes unintentionally comical. We have not one but two love triangles. In addition we have a noble thief who helps the cop out when he becomes disabled. Then there's the rickety bridge over the river of lava which of course gives way before everyone gets over it. There are two deaths by falling into the lava one by heart attack and one by falling onto hard rock. There are two foolish children who become so frightened that they run away and must be rescued. And there just happens to be an aerialist around when you need one. All in all it adds up to a bit much to swallow.The science of the movie is laughably bad. Oil is unlikely to be found near a volcano active or dormant and you wouldn't drill near a volcano because the release of pressure would cause the volcano to erupt. A volcano is not a mountain with a shaft in the top that leads down to a lake of lava. If a fissure like that opened up the volcano would simply erupt because the pressure forcing the magma up would be greater than the pressure holding it down. If the volcano caused a tidal wave chances are it would head away from the island rather than heading back to it. And then there's the lab at the lip of the volcano. Who in their right mind would build a lab in such a place much less work at it? Volcano observatories are usually safely away from the lava flow not right in the path of it. It just doesn't make sense.The effects were horribly cheesy and the cinematography was just awful. Who thought it would be a good idea to have an actress in a red dress fall into a red river of lava? All you see are her head hands and feet while she tumbles into the lava.With the kind of star power assembled in the cast one would think that the acting would at least be decent but in truth the entire cast seems embarrassed to have been involved in the project delivering their lines with a kind of sheepishness that makes the movie seem all the more embarrassing.All in all a bad movie but oddly enough it can be enjoyable if you're willing to suspend disbelief to a great degree and lower your expectations. If you don't take it seriously it can be an amusing little diversion.".

I was strongly attracted to the multiple personal stories and thus cared a lot about which of these fictional characters survived and which perished.  Thus I am surprised by the cold reception given this film by many writers both amateur and professional. The characters were all carefully developed quite an accomplishment for a movie that tells so many personal stories.  Examples  We have a ratfink male whose greed gets lots of people killed.  He doubles as one third of a love triangle involving two ladies with plenty of misplaced loyalty and very little common sense.  We have a reluctant hero who leads many to safety. We have a retired tightrope walker whose former trade will be put to good use before almost everything melts away in the finale.   We are treated to the complex relationship between a gentleman crook and his pursuer the former risks his own survival by going out of his way to render assistance when the latter becomes disabled.  A lot of the characters are caught participating in a sadistic cockfight when all hell breaks loose.  What happens to most of them before the movie is over seems like a severe penalty even for cockfighting.Hollywood first realized the merits of multiple plot movies with the introduction of Vicki Baum's Grand Hotel circa 1932.  This pattern has since been followed many times usually successfully.  Examples Stagecoach The Bridge of San Luis Rey Airport Arthur Hailey's Hotel Lone Star The Big Chill and Matewan.  I believe that those responsible for When Time Ran Out... also did an excellent job of multiple character development and I loved every minute of it.".

This is one of the worst films from any genre.Paul Newman heads the cast and has a red tinge to his cheeks throughout which may either be sunburn or embarrassment. He is the chief oil driller on a volcanic Pacific island who suspects that a catastrophic eruption is a matter of days away. However the island relies on its tourist industry and business bigwigs like William Holden great actor never more wasted than he is here won't heed the warnings and insist on keeping people on the island. The eruption arrives as anticipated by Newman and the tourists are left to run for their lives from its clutches. Newman finds himself leading one group of evacuees made up of the usual clichd characters. The group includes some great stars like Ernest Borgnine Red Buttons Burgess Meredith and Jacqueline Bisset but anyone with a brain can figure out with a degree of certainty which ones are going to make it and which are doomed.The action is marred constantly by terrible special effects. The actors are critically defeated by banal dialogue and actions. The suspense element of the film fails also because it takes way too long to get going and is thoroughly predictable once it finally kicks into gear. There really is nothing positive to say about this film at all except that it was so bad that it virtually singlehandedly ended the disaster genre once and for all. If nothing else we should thank the cast and crew for that small mercy at least!".

	schema:headline " Atrocious!";
	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to believe that this atrocity exists. Irwin Allen who began his career producing inane yet campy TV shows Lost in Space etc reached his lowest ebb with WHEN TIME RAN OUT. It has something to do with oilmen and a toney resort and a volcano about to erupt...but what difference does it make. The real interest in this fiasco is wondering what the likes of Paul Newman William Holden and the great Valentina Cortese were paid to attach their names to such a movie. Newman donning what looks like Chuck Heston's EARTHQUAKE safari jacket leads a group of stranded vacationer away from the lava of an especially cheesy looking volcano. Echoes of THE POSIEDON ADVENTURE? You bet...and with such grade B talents as Pat Morita Red Buttons and Barbara Carera along for the trip. POSIEDON vet Ernest Borgnine plays a cop trailing crooked businessman Buttons. Edward Albert Veronica Hamel Alex Karras James Franciscus and Jacqueline Bisset are in it too. The film's highpoint former vaudevillian Burgess Meredith piggybacking children across a lava flow via a tightrope. Don't bother to see it to believe it...take my word for it. This film gives a writing credit to Carl Foreman could this really be the same person who penned BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI HIGH NOON and THE GUNS OF NAVARONE?!? Inexplicable. Although most of the characters appear to be wearing clothing from Sears or in the case of the women perhaps fashions from Jaclyn Smith's KMART collection the costumes were nominated for an Oscar! Luckily time did run out for Irwin Allen and he stopped making movies after this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can't get over the amount of negative feedback left here. WTRO was indeed the last of the big disaster movies but the movie as cheesy as it was still holds up pretty well. Some of the reviews here i.e. the guy who falls off the helicopter and falls towards the volcano sideways were very funny but you either take it for what it is or you don't. Personally I thought it was the cast that made this film. Paul Newman WIlliam Holden Jacqueline Bisset Ernest Borgnine and the late great James Franciscus.As an independent filmmaker myself check out www.lcafilms.com for more information I've always loved the big disaster movies of the 70's THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE THE TOWERING INFERNO EARTHQUAKE and yes even the likes of THE SWARM and WHEN TIME RAN OUT. Irwin Allen had a knack for getting big name stars to appear in his movies and it's sad that this great storyteller who was once considered the King of Hollywood was pushed down to the bottom of the barrel. He probably saw WTRO as the film that could relaunch his career but sadly that never happened.I don't agree with this trend Hollywood is going through right now where they feel the need to remake every other movie that has been made already but there are a few exceptions. I can't wait to see POSEIDON Wolfgang Peterson's remake of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE. What Peterson did was what needed to be done. He got an allstar cast for today just like Irwin Allen did back in the 70's with all his disaster movies. I would love to remake WHEN TIME RAN OUT today avoiding so many clichs and bad special effects the original had but I love the premise.Imagine yourself and your significant other on holidays on a tropical island and while there an inactive volcano suddenly erupts and you have a choice. Either stay at the hotel and pray to God the lava won't come your way or trek across the perilous wilderness hoping that you will be safe on the other side of the island. It's a wonderful movie premise and that's probably where he got all the actors to sign off. I really enjoyed WTRO for the kind of movie it was and especially because of the allstar cast it had. There's only one filmmaker today who seems to be able to gather allstar casts for his movies and that is Uwe Boll.Unfortunately his movies seem rushed and the actors always appear to be walking through their parts. They obviously got paid well and that's about it. I would love to remake THE TOWERING INFERNO today and have an allstar cast playing lead roles to supporting roles. It would be great to see the likes of Harrison Ford Bruce Willis Tom Hanks Liam Neeson Michael Douglas Sean Connery Clint Eastwood Catherine ZetaJones Kate Capshaw and many others in a disaster movie today. If I get my way you just might!!!".

	schema:headline " Unbelievably Awful";
	schema:reviewBody "Wow what can I say? Never have I seen such an appalling movie come out of a major studio. How this film ever got into theater's is simply beyond me. Directtovideo would have been more appropriate with the director opting for an Alan Smithee credit to spare the embarrassment. There is not a single redeeming value to be found in this horrendous piece of claptrap. The acting is deplorable the script is inane the sets look like leftovers from Fantasy Island the dialog is awful and at times unintentionally hilarious and the special effects are unspeakably bad. To approach this movie with the expectation of seeing a good feature film is utter lunacy. The only way to watch this movie is to take it for what it is. A joke.Let's begin with the special effects shall we? According to IMDb When Time Ran Out... was filmed on a budget of over 20 million dollars. You will have a VERY hard time believing this after witnessing the notsospecial effects presented here. They could not possibly have cost more than a few dollars. For the daytime shots the volcano is a painting matted onto the frame with black diesel smoke being emitted from behind it. During nighttime the volcano is shown via stock footage which doesn't even resemble the original volcano seen during daytime. And don't even get me started on the climactic scene in which the resort explodes in a massive fireball. Let's just say I've seen more convincing specialeffects in episodes of Bewitched.The script? Horrendous. From dialog to storyline the script is riddled with clichs and fails to deliver anything even closely resembling quality entertainment. I actually cringed when some of the characters delivered their lines. Try not to laugh as Holden spouts lines such as Nicki dear we have to get out of here the volcano's pouring lava this way!. James Franciscus's overblown dialog is particularly amusing There's not going to be any evacuation!!. The scene that takes the cake for being the most cringeworthy is the beach scene with Newman and Bisset. This scene will have you searching frantically for your remote to hit fastforward.As many other users have already said the plot recycles ideas from many of Allen's previous disaster movies and relies HEAVILY on clichs. And since the budget for special effects was clearly nonexistent the director opted to film endless footage of actors reacting to offscreen calamities while blaring melodramatic music in the background. In fact about half this movies running time is composed of actors making faces into the camera. The scene in which the allstar cast journeys to the other side of the island by car is particularly noteworthy. It consists of 10 full minutes of actors sitting in cars staring into space or at each other while trying hard not to actually say anything. Somebody actually got paid to write this?As you may have already guessed many aspects of the movies storyline are utterly absurd. Here are a few examples that will have you roaring with laughter or just leave you scratching your head1 There is a laboratory perched right ON THE LIP of an ACTIVE volcano. Who would spend millions of dollars to build this?! As expected the place is vaporized when the volcano erupts.2 The volcano will occasionally spew meteorlike lava balls which only hit the luxury hotel. Furthermore the lava balls do only minor damage while the allstar cast is in the hotel but when they have reached a safe location the lava balls cause the entire hotel to explode killing everyone inside. Very inconsistent.3 The volcano creates a tidal wave which comes TOWARDS the island. It ravages every part of the coastline except where the luxury hotel is located. How convenient.4 The allstar cast is forced to cross a rickety bridge over a river of what is apparently cold lava a scene that takes a FULL 20 MINUTES to complete. Anyone who took high school physics class would know that the bridge and anyoneanything on it would be incinerated by the heat radiating from the magma but clearly logic is not a concern in this movie. Why they have to cross the damn thing is never explained either. Action for the sake of action I suppose. Once they cross it they walk a few feet to a cave where they hide out for the rest of the movie.5 Jacqueline Bisset adopts a completely different hairstyle midway through the film. Just how long did the production stall on this thing?! The acting in this movie is appalling. Newman barely acts and looks extremely uncomfortable just being there. Bisset fails spectacularly at trying to act sexy it looks more like she has gas and the way she delivers many of her lines is awkward. Holden a legendary actor gives what is no doubt the worst performance of his career. Franciscus overacts to the point of insanity and the rest of the cast is not even worth mentioning. They're just a bunch of television stars who are used to appearing in crap like this.The cinematography is pathetic. Our director James Goldstone has seemingly achieved the impossible making a tropical island look ugly. Seriously this movie has almost no visual appeal to it making it all the more painful to endure. It's also blatantly obvious that many of the outdoor scenes were filmed on a soundstage.Shockingly When Time Ran Out was nominated for an Academy Award for best costume design anyway. Despite the undeserved nomination this movie is not recommended unless you are looking for a few unintentional laughs. The only good thing that can be said about this travesty is that it mercifully ended the disaster movie craze of the 1970's. For that reason alone this movie gets 2 stars instead of 1.".

Just how long did the production stall on this thing?! The acting in this movie is appalling. Newman barely acts and looks extremely uncomfortable just being there. Bisset fails spectacularly at trying to act sexy it looks more like she has gas and the way she delivers many of her lines is awkward. Holden a legendary actor gives what is no doubt the worst performance of his career. Franciscus overacts to the point of insanity and the rest of the cast is not even worth mentioning. They're just a bunch of television stars who are used to appearing in crap like this.The cinematography is pathetic. Our director James Goldstone has seemingly achieved the impossible making a tropical island look ugly. Seriously this movie has almost no visual appeal to it making it all the more painful to endure. It's also blatantly obvious that many of the outdoor scenes were filmed on a soundstage.Shockingly When Time Ran Out was nominated for an Academy Award for best costume design anyway. Despite the undeserved nomination this movie is not recommended unless you are looking for a few unintentional laughs. The only good thing that can be said about this travesty is that it mercifully ended the disaster movie craze of the 1970's. For that reason alone this movie gets 2 stars instead of 1.";

At least it got a lease on life on television during the eighties.Bad guy in this film is James Franciscus who thought it would be a grand idea to build a resort hotel on a small Hawaiian island with an active volcano.

He wants to become richer and he does become filthier.He marries Bill Holden's daughter Veronica Hamel to get to Holden's money. Holden is a Conrad Hilton type hotel magnate.Meanwhile another Franciscus enterprise is an oil well which Paul Newman has brought in.

	schema:headline " When in mortal danger ALWAYS follow Paul Newman!";
	schema:reviewBody "Lately and for no apparent reason I find myself to be quite massively obsessed with disaster movies from the 70's decade. These flicks guarantee spectacular action and thrills but admittedly it's also a sub genre that can all too easy be labeled as inferior and derivative. It's undeniable that you can summarize practically all 70's disaster movies by listing just a handful of recurring trademarks. 1 without producer Irwin Allen there wasn't a budget for special effects and thus no movie. 2 all disaster movies star one major star especially Charlton Heston and Paul Newman were prime choices and a long list of secondary stars like Ernest Borgnine Leslie Nielsen. 3 The characters are usually split into two camps with completely opposite ideals andor initiatives. The camp with the lead star is obviously the triumphant camp. 4 Regardless what type of disaster we're dealing with variants of the exact same perilous situations are always applicable. 5 always remember that when the situation appears to be at it worst it can and will still get even worse! Not coincidentally When Time Ran Out answers to ALL the above trademarks and thus ranks as the ultimately clichd disaster flick. This shouldn't come as too much as a surprise as the film was released in 1980 which is more than half a decade after the disaster movie hype was at its peak. Paul Newman stars as the robust macho workman Hank Anderson drilling for oil on a Pacific island that is particularly famous for its tropical holiday resort run by the stubborn and obnoxious island patriarch Brian Franciscus. Everyone's victorious when Newman and C hit the black gold jackpot but he warns about the oil's pressure causing the island's volcano to regain activity. Almost everybody disregards Hank's warnings even when the volcano does erupt and spits out flaming balls of fire. Anderson eventually gathers a small group of intelligent people to flee towards higher grounds but the majority of tourists and workmen stupidly remain at the resort to await a certain and painful death. When Time Ran Out is a bad movie mainly because the characters are walking talking caricatures and never cease to take really stupid decisions. Take Brian Franciscus for example. He refuses to leave or even stop the drillings because he desperately wants to prove to his father that he's a successful businessman and resort owner. But his father is dead and all that remains of him is a stern portrait on the wall. The tourists are even worse. Franciscus initially assures them the volcano will not erupt. He was wrong. Later on he assures them the volcano won't be spitting out any fireballs. He was wrong again. Finally he claims the volcanic lava will never reach the resort and these idiots still believe him! Wouldn't it be smarter to stay close to the guy who has been right about the volcano since the beginning? I guess not since only the actors with a slightly bigger paycheck accompany Paul Newman on the perilous journey across the island. I didn't think it was possible but the script becomes even dumber from then onwards. There's a tidal wave approaching the island even though it should go the other direction and into the ocean and Newman's group shrinks in number due to some textbook clichs like steep rocks and ramshackle wooden bridges over lava rivers. If all this isn't trite enough for you just yet we still have some additional clichs on sale like the elderly who sacrifices his life to rescue a child the triangular relationship between the hero the millionaire and the hot rebellious girl and the ridiculously abrupt ending. There is one remotely ingenious sub plot that is worth mentioning however. Ernest Borgnine plays a cop indiscreetly following around a fraudulent banker but during the environmental disaster they become close friends and dependent on each other. In conclusion When Time Ran Out is literally a disaster of film. It's a volcanic eruption of derivative ideas predictable moves and cheesy effects. But on the other hand I didn't get bored for one second throughout the entire 121 minutes of running time and that alone might be worth a recommendation!".

The protagonist appears as a freak but compared to the rest of the world he is the most normal one it is the behave of the society which leads him to his abnormality. An other strong critical emphasis is put on the consumesociety of our world. TV advertisements are shown totally ridiculously and the products they advertise are totally nonsense. It may appear quite funny but if we think about this fact it is shown like it is in reality. Profit and consume dominate about rationality and humanity. It is one of the best movies I've seen in the last year the humor is not typical American slapstick or Al Bundy like but the vulgar talking of the protagonist calms the pathetic style and makes it easier to watch and also very funny.

Like his other semiautobiographical move titled Nic Smiesznego  nothing funny Dzien Swira records the inner dialogue  the prose of a single day in the life of Adam Miauczynski a character based on M. Koterski. Miauczynski like Koterski is an compulsiveobsessive excentric bitter  disillusioned individual caught in Poland's post communist reality a reality as Ill suited to him as the communist one was. One of the reasons why Koterski's work is either loved or intensly disliked by Poles is the painfully acurate description of polish hell made all the more vivid by his insistance on showing the trivial  at the same time essential moments of daily life in excruciating detail. life is all the more hell when the damned are aware that life could be different and this is what makes Miauczynski's suffering all the more real.  A number of the scenes are classics unequalled by any of Koterski's contemporaries especially the  scenes depicting Miauczynski's relationship with his son the senate train toilet and street demonstration scenes.It is unfortuante for the western viewer that the context  language of the film make it very difficult to translate adequatly refering as it does to polish classical literature contemporary culture and nighuntranslatable street slang the contrast being all the more vivid since Miauczynski is a Polish literature lecturer obsessed with what he percieves to be the decay of the language he loves.If I were to compare Koterski to any western director it would be to Britain's  Mike Leigh. An insane Mike leigh with an infectious sense of humour  a penchant for social commentary.All in all This is Koterski's finest work to date perhaps the finest Polish film in the last 5 years. My rating is a solid 810".

One side is his own obsessions never ending health problems pressure of his mom and always looking for better and never finding true love dilemma. Second is the weirdness of the society a harsh criticism of Polish people and funny examples of how stingy not friendly selfish they are.Of course it does have some cultural references to Polish life and history which I could not understand since I am not Polish but most of the movie is about us all human beings.Just give it a try I'm sure you'll find some similarity to your life.".

Again they were decent efforts but not comparable to movies of the same genre from Hong Kong Hard Boiled or America Resevoir Dogs. This film however is a true work of art. Not just made to look cool but to express a directors point of view. I think it compares to Aronofsky's masterpiece Pi in that it's story about a man lost in the search for something. Granted is the fact that this is a very different film than Pi in its story but artistically it's a good achievement for a Polish director who looks like he is on his way to be among Wajda and Kieslowski. 910No MPAA rating.

	schema:reviewBody "Even though I've lived in Poland for over a year now I generally don't watch many Polish movies especially newer ones which I've found to be very derivative of American and British films. This movie however is a true gem. A rare film that makes you take stock of your own choices in life. The movie focuses on a day though actually it has to be more than one day in the life of Adas a 49 year old high school teacher from Warsaw who's first words to us are I'm afraid of waking up and we soon learn thats not all he's afraid of. Adas is deeply dissatisfied with every aspect of his life. From his noisy neighbors to his broken family to the Polish government to his own inability to climb out of his personal hell. Told mostly through narration voiceover which clues us in to Adas's thought process the film explores the turmoil of middle age with an honesty and poignancy rare in film. While certainly hilarious in moments this movie serves up an equal or greater amount of melancholy as well balancing the two aspect delicately. As Adas passes from compulsion to depression to denial to rage we learn more about him and come to empathize with him. The most striking feature of this movie for me was the universality of Adas and the relateability to him. Yes he is Polish with some uniquely Polish complaints and problems but he could easily be any middle aged man in any western society. While he's a wacko in his own way what the movie says is aren't we all? aren't we all this man in some way? This movie did for me what hardly any movies do anymore it made me think and reflect about my own life and my own choices and any movie that can do that deserves praise in my book.".

NonPoles who are not interested in or have no idea about Polish culture and realities will probably not get half of the film but I still recommend it to anyone who's open minded. This is a story about a welleducated and intelligent teacher in his middleages who can't stand stupidity ignorance his neighbours and generally everyone and everything around him. If you've seen Falling Down 1993 with Michael Douglas which is by the way another film I'd recommend you'll get the point. However no plagiarism was used here. The main character hates himself as well mainly for the lack of inspiration in writing and still being dependant on his mother. The whole movie is presented within the monologues he has in his head in many cases dirty ones. And by that I mean many vulgarisms which at some point may get repelling. Although containing some comic parts this film is depressing especially if you think about the man's tragedy because his life can be called like that. If you try to understand his situation see why he's frustrated and why there are so many negative feelings in him you'll probably reach the point in which you'll feel down. There are many Polish stereotypes system faults and absurd presented and in some way laughed out. But then again you have a depressing feeling of not being able to do anything about it. I really recommend watching this movie to anyone especially to those who have some mixed feelings about the world. If it's possible try to talk to any Polish person around so heshe would explain some of the things that may be typical for Polish society and not common at all in other cultures. I just hope the English translation of this film is good...General note 1010 and I really mean it.".

This one isn't funny and if there scenes to laugh about it's not because they're funny but because they're true.The Day of the Wacko is about one day taken from a life of a underpaid depressed Polish language teacher in Warsaw. But it's also about getting old and tired of life that seemed so happy and nice at first and then turned into a total disaster  a disaster that a lot of people getting old not only in Poland experience. Another movie about Adas Miauczynski is true to the bone it tries to picture the confrontation between the idealist dreams that all of us had while being young with reality that often is depressing and sad. And it does...The Day of the Wacko also makes a few points about us Polish people or rather people in general that we often try to hide or make them go away in our minds. I believe each and every person after watching the movie will feel that this it's even in a flash about themselves.The screenplay and directing is really good but the movie would be poor if not for some excellent acting by Marek Kondrat as Adas Miauczynski  he's not excellent he's absolutely wonderful as a man that considers himself as the lowest of the low. In my opinion this is one of the most universal Polish movies ever made at least after 1989 and anyone interested in Polish cinema should take a while to see it.1010".

This movie apart Koterski's location is widely describing human social habits and it's showing how seeking of life's purpose might poison social behavior. Marek Koterski definitely outreaches Nic Smiesznego Nothing funny vision in Wacko. Every single scene including those containing dirty words and actions is describing how predictable people are under defined circumstances and how dumb we might be even while having so much knowledge and theoretical understanding of feelings. Everlasting seeking for perfection clearly illustrated by dreaming of Ela main character frustration on payday or subordination and blind following alternated by opposing to his mother are just few examples. Adam sky high above all his neighbors or travel mates is probably being seen as recluse but he doesn't see his problem he is concentrated on me myself and I. This movie is about loneliness and warns viewers to not to elevate walls separating them from society. When watching Day of the Wacko with this point of view in mind you might be surprised how much of Wacko you have in yourself. And it's deep deserves 10.".

I myself came to Canada just a few years ago and I feel that the movie Dzien Swira is an interesting and comical take on the serious issue of depression. The fact that the protagonist uses unusual and sometimes unethical ways to deal with his anger and anxiety makes the movie more realistic. When dealing with inner turmoil people do not always make right choices they often push people away. As viewers watch the movie they begin to feel a connection to this lonely and depressed man. Maybe the Vancouver viewer really did not understand the poet's neurotic excretions as she says for she misses the main point of the movie its message. The fact that this man is Polish is just that ..his ethnicity is not the point of the movie but rather his personal struggle. I do not feel that there were so many stereotypes because as many of us Poles know the writer of this movie plays the son in it. That in itself breaks the mold. Simple minded individuals watch dzien swira and do no analyze it. One must watch and think about why he does he do the things he does. As a polka I feel this movie is not only very funny but one that leaves the audience thinking Krwa.".

This screened at the Vancouver Film Festival three days ago and I made the voyage to the theatre feeling stoic and anticipating something momentous... after all reverence and sentiment is something that runs amongst all of the Poles I know and no wait  why is there a blisteringly heavyhanded metaphor that includes people playing tugowar with the Polish flag it ripping and I can't believe they stooped this cliche BLOOD yes blood spatters out from where it tears???? Help.. am I too young to appreciate an aging poet's neurotic excretions? I wondered the same thing when I started watching Bridges over Madison County.. will I be able to relate to a mature ripe and slowerpaced perspective on life? In the case of Bridges I was lured by the universally binding theme of love kinship and romance however removed it was from mine. In WACKO not only did I have a hard time believing the protagonist but all of the supporting characters were caricature cutouts of things you see in 80s sitcoms in North America the venomous and nothing else xwife the apathetic and disinterested and nothing else young son the students who are defined by their flatulence and interest in bodily injuries of their professor. I have to claim philanthropy for every character not just the women because they are so onedimensional and the protagonist is simply... boring. None of the details which are supposed to be quaint his measuring coffee JUST so resonate because there is so much repetition that you just want to tear your hair out waiting for the director to get to the point. By midway through the film I have to admit to my beloved boyfriend Zagreb born UK raised that this film has none of the imagination nor raw honesty of films like JAK DALEKO Z TAD JAK BLISKO nor INTERROGATION because it's attempting to do something it considers to be NEW ie. Poles are not historically about going on about mastrubation crapping suicide ... I felt the same as when I went to a theatre in SZCZECIN a couple of summers ago and they did Natural Born Killers the stage version. Totally disappointing and unimaginative... I hope that the next thing to hit the circuit does not go where this film dragged the audience through.".

This is supposed to be a character study of Adam and his dysfunctions but there is absolutely nothing to latch onto. His problems are centered on the fact that he has OCD and has to carefully measure his every move but instead of a detailed subtle examination of a complex person we're given a stereotype that falls somewhere between Psych 101 and a cartoon. If this wasn't bad enough the audience is further insulted by the fact that nearly every moment of this film is filled with Adam's narration that explains his motivations for everything in the most simplified terms. As a novel the narration would lack subtlety and depth as a film technique it's unforgivable. As for the supposed humor none of it works. Half of the jokes come from awkward and unnecessary vulgarity and mind you my favorite director is John Waters and the other half are intended to stem from the character only there is no actual character so there are no actual jokes. All the exchanges between Adam and the people he meet are forced and unrealistic. Don't look to this film for insight entertainment or social commentary.

Both the hero and the script writer comes out as whinny and people who just can't enjoy life for a single moment and if your message is that all people in Poland are this way I can't agree or give the movie any respect. It lost me early on and 23 funny moments aren't enough to win me back especially is most of so called is just vulgar...";

Zak doesn't like the way the Army keeps the base and the bar is not what he's accustomed to. So he goes off base to get a beer. When he goes to the bar one of the local prostitutes tries to come on to Zak but Zak turns her down. That's when the deputy who appears to be her pimp beating her up. That's when Zak strikes him. Later he learns that the Sheriff is corrupt and takes what happened to the Deputy as an attack on him and tries to get Zak but the Army backs him and Zak is not intimidated. That's when they arrest his son on trumped up drug charges. Before Zak can fix it his wife tries to get a lawyer for their son but this only pushes the Sheriff to send their son to a prison farm. With no other recourse Zak gets into his own vintage Sherman Tank and busts his son out and they try to make it to the state line so that they can expose the Sheriff.";

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed this movie by the looks of the score I am a bit alone in my opinion of this film. The story has a guy in the army who somehow owns his own personal tank moving onto a new army base. I am rather sure they probably explained how he had his own tank but it has been awhile since I last saw this film so I do not remember parts of it all that well. What I do know is that one evening James Garner's character the one with the tank goes into town and ends up taking out a deputy. This infuriates the sheriff of the town and he wants revenge. He seems to have some problem with the military folk and it is against the law to punch a cop even one who deserves it. Of course this part of the film makes little sense to me usually a southern town like the one depicted here would embrace the military and be patriotic even bashing the lawman for bruising the army guys hand or something. Same strange hatred of the military appeared in the film First Blood. Most of these bases also offer jobs to the locals and provide income as a lot of military guys have a lot of money to spend on frivolous things. That aside the sheriff gets his hands on the army guy's son and now the army guy is ticked so ticked he uses his tank to break his son out of a boot camp style prison. A cross state chase soon occurs as they know they will not get a fair trail where they are so they head to either the next county or state do not recall which. Some good humor to follow along with some good action. The movie gets a bit to heavy handed near the end and the thing with the dad getting his ribs broke was a bit to much but all in all I found this movie quite enjoyable.".

Zack Carey who moves to an army base with his wife and son in the south but gets on the wrong side of the local sheriff when he knocks out the deputy in bar quarrel. Too proud to let it slide they want payback so they frame his son with a drug charge and imprison him. Carey would now do it the sheriff's way to get his son out of prison but circumstances change when that isn't followed leaving his son to be convicted serving three years. So Carey gets in his own prized Sherman tank to bust out his son while heading for the state border in search for actual justice. Ludicrous but amusingly dreamtup bootkicking patriotic nonsense of standing up. What starts off quite serious where I thought it might culminate in pushing Rambo First Blood territory ended up as chaotically gungho and comedic in a very mechanical but spirited sense. Relatively wellmade with spacious cinematography and an upbeat music score contributed by Lalo Schifrin. Materialwise the wit is there but it's a little deeper in its perspective themes in which it really does moralise its intentions  as what eventuates is a tug of war involving sappy dialogues and silly humour. The early sequences build some intense confrontations  where Garner and Spradlin's authority figures go at it each other in their own personal war. But soon that is all forgotten when Garner goes for a pleasant ride with his tank and ends up on sort of a road trip with what seems like all of America are riding the heroic underdog home. Go you good thing! One thing that's for sure is that in one sequence Jenilee Harrison looks good behind the tank's machine gun. An excellent Garner is suitably likable and G.D. Spradlin nails down his bastard role as Sheriff Cyrus Buelton. Also there's a very good support cast linedup with Shirley Jones Dorian Harewood James Cromwell C. Thomas Howell and John Hancock.".

	schema:headline " A reasonably enjoyable film";
	schema:reviewBody "Not only does Tank offer varied assortments in the ways of wit action and humor I believe that it also accurate portrays the periodic levels of corruption that previously and continue to plague the various small town whitebred trailer trash communities across the nation moreover a mild example of which I can personally relate to.Two years ago a similar rural community with it's own breed of laws and regulations attempted to suspend my driving privileges upon ticketing a driver for speeding that had confiscated a driver's license that I had previously reported as stolen. My attempts to explain myself only proved a fruitless endeavor as the community encouraged me to pay up and get over it. Only after I hired an attorney and threatened a lawsuit did the grit munching scumsuckers in question withdraw their insistence.Within this film a corrupt southern bred police department attempts to enslave an Army Major's son after a deputy is justifiable beaten up in retaliation to assaulting a falsely branded prostitute. As a portion of cover the malevolent Sheriff runs a broadly defined farm that actually qualifies as a labor camp from which to subject luckless youths to intensive brutality. After failed attempts to appease the Sheriff's fury James Garner elects to take matters into his own hands commandeering a personally owned Sherman Tank in which to spring his son and demolish a few of the corrupt police department's facilities along the way.Perhaps another reason I enjoyed this movie is the presence of the highly versatile score by the incomparable Lalo Schifrin who employs every compositional style in the book from Jazz to traditional military marches and a highly catchy disco tune. Unfortunately the latter becomes a subject of unwarranted contempt from the Sergeant major's redneck upbringing as he encourages local bars to refit their repertroire to stay any unwanted coersions to dance the funky monkey.Overall the film offers a highly sympathetic premise that eerily enough seems completely plausible in today's terms given the prevalence of small towns isolated from the civilized world and thus prone to erect their own dictatorial policies no matter how severe.".

My attempts to explain myself only proved a fruitless endeavor as the community encouraged me to pay up and get over it. Only after I hired an attorney and threatened a lawsuit did the grit munching scumsuckers in question withdraw their insistence.Within this film a corrupt southern bred police department attempts to enslave an Army Major's son after a deputy is justifiable beaten up in retaliation to assaulting a falsely branded prostitute.

The Sheriff sees this as a reflection on him and attempts to persecute Carey. When Carey stands up to the Sheriff the Sheriff plants drugs on Carey's son and tells Carey he will send his son to a prison camp if the Sergeant Major does not give him a large sum of money in a payoff. Sergeant Carey pays him off but the Sheriff reneges takes the money and sends the Sergeant's son to the prison camp. The Sheriff also hints that Carey's son will be raped in the camp. The Sergeant Major has had enough and takes off in his restored Sherman Tank in order to break his son out of the camp and cross the state line so he can get fair justice. This is a strange movie. It has some very dark moments yet it has some laugh out loud moments due to some very funny dialogue. The film has a rousing silly ending.It's hard not to like any movie with the great James Garner in it. G.D. Spradling is very good as the evil Sheriff. The WWII era Sherman Tank is also fun to watch especially when the Sergeant Major destroys the Sheriff's office.".

He's moved on the post with wife Shirley Jones and younger son C. Thomas Howell. Garner and Jones's older son was killed a short while back in an accident and they're still grieving. Also moving on the post is Garner's pride and joy a World War II vintage Sherman tank which he has reassembled and he's the only man in the US Army with his own personal Tank.One night while visiting one of the local bars he sees one of the hookers Jenilee Harrison being beaten by a sheriff's deputy James Cromwell. It bothers him and Garner takes matters in his own hands. But assaulting an Alabama deputy sheriff in his own town is normally not a good idea. As Sergeant Dorian Harewood of the Provost Marshal's office tells Garner the sheriff G.D.Spradlin is a 'mean cracker'. Spradlin bides his time and then frames Howell on a drug charge. After exhausting the legal means Garner resorts to the illegal and puts his career and pension at risk but becomes one popular dude.One of the best things Tank has going for it is the real chemistry between Garner Jones and Howell. You don't think of them as players they become a real family on the screen. You also see Garner going about his daily routine on the post and you note that this is a man in whose hands the country's defense is in. As long as we do produce men like Garner for our Armed Services the country's in good hands.Tank was shot on several army bases and has an authentic army look about it. In fact all the players and their are several familiar ones really do convey themselves as soldiers. Garner and Mess Sergeant John Hancock have a really humorous confrontation and Hancock for example is someone you really do think of as an army mess sergeant not just an actor playing one.Tank gives Garner and Jones roles that fit their age bracket perfectly they are two of the best roles both of those players have had in their later years. Tank is good family entertainment with something for all ages of moviegoers.".

	schema:reviewBody "The billing for Tank is right on the mark. It is an action drama and comedy film with some serious overtones. Although rated PG it's most appropriate for mature adults. In other words those who don't get too much glee out of the treatment of prisoners on the county work farm and those who think the allusions and references to being beaten to death gangraped and killed are really that funny. It's not for kids at all  with just enough nudity foul language and discussion of prostitution adultery etc. to go along with the violent aspects. The film also is a look at Army life during peacetime. The film came out in 1984 so it takes place around then. Sgt. Maj. Zack Carey James Garner has been in the Army 30 years. Both he and Maj. Gen. Hubik Sandy Ward have rows of ribbons on their chest. Both also have senior parachutist badges and Ranger patches as well as Combat Infantry Badges CIB. They would have entered the service after Korea and probably had considerable combat time in Vietnam. Zack appears to have nine hash marks on his sleeve  which would represent four and one half years in combat zones. The IMDb film summary describes the plot in enough detail. The cast are all very good in their parts. Besides those mentioned above Shirley Jones is good as Zack's'wife LaDonna C. Thoms Howell if very good as son Billy Jenilee Harrison as the local hooker Sarah James Cromwell is the doormat and abusive deputy Euclid Dorian Harewood is very good as Sgt. Tippett and G.D. Spradlin is excellent as Sheriff Buelton. Tank seems to have capitalized on the popularity of the long running TV series The Dukes of Hazzard which was set in the South. This film has more bite and sarcasm about the corrupt and dictatorial local law found in some places but it is a lot of fun for mature audiences. We root for Sgt. Major Zack as he demolishes Sheriff Buelton's office and jail and makes his escape across the northern Georgia county to the Tennessee state line. The film takes pokes at the military and local southern communities that host military bases  mostly the latter. It jabs Biblethumping law enforcement and hypocrites especially those often characterized as being in the South. The setting for the film is a fictitious Army base Fort Clemmons. It's located in Georgia supposedly in the NW not far from the Tennessee border. Anyone familiar with that part of the country would know how hilly and high it can get. That's at the end of the Blue Ridge Mountains on the borders of Virginia West Virginia Kentucky North Carolina and Tennessee. The opening scene shows vehicles driving through flat treecovered country. That's the type of country around Ft. Benning GA much further south which is also where most of the Army base scenes were shot. Ft. Benning has been the home of the U.S. Infantry since 1918 and has several specialty training centers and schools there. Among them are the Airborne parachutist and Ranger schools Officer Candidate School OCS the Infantry school and others. Since 2005 it has been home of the Armor School which moved from Fort Knox KY. And since that year Ft. Benning has been designated the U.S. Army Maneuver Center of Excellence. The film shows the 114th Infantry Division at the fictitious base. There hasn't been such a division in the U.S. Army although there has been a 114th Inf. Regiment Military families those with such backgrounds and anyone interested in the military and war films should enjoy this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "While that is unheard of today back in the 80's it wasn't so. Movies and popular culture didn't have that PC dogma. While this movie is...a jingoistic ballad for the Reagan era. Tank does have a great antagonist. Even the 80's produced despicable villains who you enjoyed hating. Not one of these overly polite villains who kill you with kindness and have the consideration of today's good guys. Garner and Spradlin are not at fault here. Garner's Master Sergeant Carey and Spradlin's Cyrus Buelton actually gave performances above their salary. Not Oscar worthy but that's not this kind of material and I think they saw that going in. It's everyone else who just delivers these perky and wooden performances that probably reflect their enthusiasm. Or salary. The plot begins with M.Sgt. Carey visiting a bar and chatting it up with a prostitute. Well Carey's not a local and is unaware of local politics. When the deputy abuses a local pro who lives in a clich'd trailer Carey chivalrously doles out repercussions to him. Well the next morning the big hoss sees that he's been disrespected. Since Euclid has his face marked up metaphorically the Sheriff's face is marked up. Well that just encourages degenerates to start sassing their hoss.Apparently Buelton fancies himself a surrogate father who views his subjects as belligerents. And enjoys that. Buelton runs his district like Caligula Tiberius Nero and a 4 foot Napoleon combined! Well things escalate as Buelton's petty ego demands extortion and retribution. I love how Buelton being a Sheriff doesn't know much about law except what he chooses to know and enforce. Buelton has Carey's son Billy framed to get to Carey and shows Carey who's the massa at a inmate labor farm. In a notsoveiled threat to inspire compliance from Carey. Well Carey's wife complicates matters by hiring a lawyer who is promptly incarcerated and Buelton provoked into upping the ante to show Carey he means business. While this story seems far fetched it's supposed to be based on an incident with Patton. I couldn't see execs greenlighting a project like this today on this scale. But if you like these far fetched 80's films. I recommend writers take note of how a villain is should be portrayed. Tank did succeed in making Buelton so ruthlessly sadistic that you yearned for Buelton to get his comeuppance. But that's all it succeeded in doing it. The result is far less gratifying. Short story longWhat the movie's morality is saying is that when you play by the rules and the law doesn't you have carte blanche to see that you get the justice you deserve. As long as you have ten grand a wife of suspiciously infinite kindness and a Sherman Tank at Fort Benning. This is sadistic filmmaking at it's best.".

As part of my quest to watch every cheeseball action flick from the 80's through a set of adult eyes this one was actually on my active list of movies to find a cheap copy of recalling that it was somewhat popular at the time and for 0.25 at a local thrift store I was both able to accomplish the tasks of crossing this one off the list and reflecting that even as a 15 yearold I could judge a book by its cover pretty good. I mean just look at the cover of the box! If that picture of James Garner giving the thumbs up and the kid doing the hell yeah! doesn't give you a clue of what you're in for then I don't know what can.So this is one of those movies where some people might say they sure don't make them like this anymore to which I would have to disagree. Considering the ridiculous plot the fact that nothing anybody does or what goes down would ever happen in real life and the complete absence of common sense or realism in any way shape or form I'd say it is very much in keeping with the low IQ crap that gets churned out these days and may have been ahead of its time. I can see why the sheriff was on such a power trip though since if the base was in Fort Benning and his county extended to the Tennessee state line the guy was in charge of hundreds and hundreds of square miles. I'm surprised he didn't have a bigger jail and more deputies and even more surprised that James Garner didn't just drive into Alabamanot that he wouldn't have been blown to pieces before he even got to the fence at the perimeter of the base! I could go on and on about the plot holes large enough to drive a Sherman tank through and as far as this movie is concerned does. It's completely ridiculous but while it technically deserves maybe two or three stars at best I'm giving it seven because it either had my palm to my forehead or laughing my ass off. Really dumb cheesy stuff for fans of really dumb cheesy stuff! If you are in the mood for a serious 1980's crapfest then find a cheap copy somewhere and prepare to be stunned by the shear dumbassitude.".

	schema:headline " A scary carpet?";
	schema:reviewBody "Der Teppich des Grauens is a coproduction between West Germany Italy and Spain from 1962 so this film is already over 50 years old. The director is Harald Reinl mostly known for Winnetou these days and the writers if at all will be known mostly only to fans of these countless German Edgar Wallace adaptations. With the year nobody should be surprised that this is a blackandwhite film and it runs for slightly under 90 minutes just like most of the other German crime movies from back then. There is maybe an ounce of comedy less in there as usual but the rest is very similar to what you probably would expect namely an evil mastermind murder a cop investigating attractive women etc. And with Fuchsberger Dor and Peters you will also find some extremely familiar faces. The smaller parts include many Italian and Spanish actors that I as a German am not familiar with at all but maybe people from these countries will find a name or two they recognize. There is really nothing more to say. In my opinion it is true that if you have seen one or two Bryan Edgar Wallace films then you have seen them all pretty much. The good thing is that if you appreciate one you will like them all. I myself do not though as I find the crime stories always pretty uninspired and not realistic at all. Acting is bearable but nothing special either. Overall the weak and forgettable outweighs the good I think and I give The Carpet of Horror a thumbsdown. Not recommended unless you really love the series.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was watching an episode of the animated scifi comedy Futurama on television and was laughing away at this episode about The Curse Of The WereCar and sure enough....the car they had used was an animated version of that wonderful demonpossessed black sedan from 1977's The Car! Fond memories of that film flooded back to me....Some critics dismissed The Car as a Jaws on wheels and it was also lost in the wake of Star Wars' release pouncing any other films out at that time. The general audience was a bit befuddled by the more cerebral aspects of The Car and just weren't sure what they were watching. That's what makes this film one that has made a nice comeback on VHSDVD for collectors who appreciated all the elements that made The Car unique.While the film Christine was more of a commercial success it was a much cruder telling of a story and didn't have a sense of wonderment that drew us into the fantasy. The Car was as New York Press writer Jim Knipfel wrote If Ingmar Bergman had made a horror movie about a murderous automobile he would have made The Car. The philosophical edge didn't turn the story into a joke but rather gave some weight to a fantastic and desperate situation balancing the dread and the actions of the townspeople.The Car is visually stunning the desert location is used in a very scenic way instead of vast empty spaces that usually are obvious for film economics. Here the locations are all over bridges mountains and yes open spaces...all are used well and keep the beauty in contrast to the sinister element driving through and plowing people down. Excellent camera work keeps this one a notch above even more mainstream films.I've always though that cars up through the 1970s had faces on them mostly expressions of anger or sinister intentions. The most beautiful cars in the world could just be so frightening if you look right at them. This black sedan custom made for the film could just sit there and do nothing well it does sit on dark streets sometimes and you'll get chills.Combine the scenery with the deadly car and the various personalities of the characters and you have something more profound than just a movie about a mysterious car running people down. These people have purposes ideals and obviously problems and put those against the situation they're faced with...this film is chock full of substance. In a way like an art film it is true as Knipfel also noted that Ronnie Cox the alcoholic deputy is weeping a lot and is seen mostly in doorways and windows. James Brolin the sheriff does tend to stop and stare at walls as if to find answers and Kathleen Lloyd the school teacher decides to get in a debate with the Car as it has them trapped in a strangely placed graveyard.While you won't be terrified out of your seat you will definitely feel some goose bumps and find yourself with a serious look on your face as you gaze at several scenes. Yes there is something about this film that transcended the typical horror genre. I have a first printing of the paperback novelization by Dennis Shryack And Michael Butler Dell Books May 1977 and the book does go a bit deeper into the why's and how's and such of the Car and the mysticism involved. But the film does a fine job of entertaining even if you want to say it's schlock you can't deny it's much elevated above the other Bhorror efforts of the time.Many many horror films like the prettyteensinperil ones being manufactured ad nauseam are pretty much forgotten after the initial video rentals die down. Then there are films like The Car that have been sought after for years and celebrated when it arrived on VHSDVD for the first time since its theatrical release in 1977. Films as unique as The Car have held their own because there was care put into their production more thought to its intention and a longlasting affect on those who have understood it and appreciated it.Sure a horror film doesn't have to be full of importance to be a fun and scary experience but when film makers take that chance to make something more unique then good for them! Long live The Car!".

And is it plaguing our major characters because of their sins? i.e. Ronny Cox as an alcoholic falling off the wagon James Brolin as a single parent trying to keep his daughters happy as he dates sexy Kathleen Lloyd. What I'm saying is at its heart this is a creepy unsettling film with some really strange philosophicalreligious questions at its core. And how many horror films can claim that? A solid 710.".

	schema:reviewBody "You may be surprised to find out that while it's not GradeA material The Car is actually a very wellmade and underrated film. The director's biggest achievement is that he has taken a ridiculous premise and somehow crafted a fine thriller out of the material. He uses some sly techniques to get the viewer involved with most of the characters even the ones who are in the film only to get run over by the villain a mysterious black sedan that drives out of the desert to randomly run people down.Sure sure it's silly but within the dry universe of this movie it comes off as very menacing. Not only is the film wellconstructed but it plays on some very deep psychological reactions that we as human beings share. I think every person is unconsciously wary of being struck by a speeding car and here is a car that exists solely for that purpose. If a car on the highway cuts you off you're probably going to think That guy's an idiot but the characters don't often refer to the driver of the car when talking amongst themselves they acknowledge it as simply the car. Notice the subtle moment when one of the little girls in the film says that Lauren cussed the car outnot the driver! Additionally a car horn can immediately conjure a rush of primal fearhow many times have you drivers had a nearaccident that was avoided only because of the honk of a horn?and the weird staccato horn blasts of the car suggest a disproportionately larger vehicle like an 18wheeler. Completing the effect is the fact that the car has no driver. This isn't the work of a psycho motorist it's actually the car itself that is doing it.The cinematography is outstanding in this film too. There are many subtle images that make an impression such as long wide shots of the desert that are broken by the glimmer of sunlight off of the car's windshield off in the distance. The car itself is intriguingit has a few identifiable characteristics of a modified Lincoln but it's very weird. In one of the movie's creepiest scenes the grille of the car rolls silently out of the blackness and waits for the perfect moment to attack suddenly roaring to life and taking off like a bat out of hell to go run down its intended victim. There is also a brilliantly freakish moment when we suddenly realize exactly what the car is capable of it does not even need to stick to the road to carry out its violent intent and we see it careening toward one of its victims even as she huddles inside her house. The director makes full use of the locations such as the strange tunnel at the beginning of the film those wide open desert shots and the quarry at the climax of the film when our heroes set a trap for the car.The weaknesses include certain portions of the soundtrack campy thriller music that cheapens the overall effect of the film. There is also some awkward acting from a few of the supporting characters. One particularly shocking scene where the car attacks a children's parade rehearsal features a few goofy moments of humor intentional and otherwise that lessen the overall effect of an otherwise tense scene. The lives of the characters encompass some unpleasant elements such as spousal abuse alcoholism and religious crisis but it gets a little too heavyhanded and the first impulse is to not take these things seriously.But when The Car is all revved up it's very suspenseful and effective. There are some truly amazing stunts in it and they're captured well on film. It's got a giddy sort of terror to it...it's both silly and scary. Highly recommended.".

I love films where heroes and villains have to work together.If I'm not mistaken The Car is a George Barris customization.

After all the terror and killing the cops still need the help of the wifebeater to put an end to the 4wheeled monster. I love films where heroes and villains have to work together.If I'm not mistaken The Car is a George Barris customization. Whether that's right or not I know it's a heavilymodified 2dr Lincoln most likely a '67 or '68 model.This is a fun film to watch whether you're out for a thrill or just to MST a bad movie.K. N.

But the craft involved really makes this film exceed what you might think possible for a film with such a hoodah Bmovie premise.  The set pieces are constructed with care boosted by fine cinematography and editing and the car winds up genuinely menacing.  The characters are nothing to write home about but they at least react to the prospect of a menacing killer vehicle in a fairly tangible way that is except for the the hero's girlfriend in the movie's worst scene but hey it's a set up.....  That is an important thing most genre thrillers prefer to pass up on or fail to accomplish.

Though not on the level of Jaws or The Omen and seemingly an amalgam of 2 or 3 prior used horror themes it remains an interesting scareflic and stands the test of time rather well. It appears out of nowhere and viewers have to develop their own back stories as in hell needs more souls fast so this is an agent to expedite matters. Its point of view is shot thru a red filter natch. It has no other purpose than to kill people on the roads tho it can travel thru houses when it has to. It lacks even the rudimentary reasoning of a shark which kills to eat again make up your own reasons. The religious connotations are brushed over but that's fine the last thing this film needed was a priest character to explain it all. It taunts and tortures its victims the level depending on how much they have offended it it's not wise to curse at it. Its car horn modulates the sounds it makes depending on how it feels  it laughs chortles blares in anger  but always in an offensive tone grating on the ears of humans. It even has a devilish sense of humor as in its catandmouse games with James Brolin's character. Human beings are definitely the mice here existing solely for The Car's warped amusement. There's one quick 3second scene in the middle of the long chase with the cops the Car swerves slightly just to cause an oncoming nonpoliceautomobile to spin out  The Car has personality to spare. Brolin in his prime leading man years of the late seventies is at first at a loss but soon decides nothing short of blowing up an entire canyon will address this matter properlike. But the real star is The Car itself the Lincoln Mark III black  customized all to hell. It's a bravura creation and really does seem invulnerable as well as supernatural. Anytime it shows up the scenes are energized tense and quite exciting. The overall scheme of the picture is rather simplistic and that's why it doesn't rate higher with me but for what it is The Car is a helluva ride. There was an obvious setup for a sequel at the end in the big city but it never happened.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen The Car several times over the years.  I am a big fan of horror movies and while this is not exactly a classic by any means I still enjoyed it.  The plot is basically a car which drives around a desert town killing everyoneanyone it can.  In these types of movies you tend to enjoy watching and choosing who becomes the victims.  I found the acting to be a little trying at times.  In fact at times very bad.  I mean having two actors scream at each other in one scene does not create tension it creates confusion.  I like James Brolin in this film and John Marley as well even though he didn't have much to do.The star of the movie is The Car.  What I did not enjoy about the film was as a viewer I did not know anything about the car.  Where did it come from? Why was it there?  Was it the devil?  A demon?  I wanted to know more about this killing machine.  I found that by the end of the film I was still a little confused.  Also I think this movie was a ripoff of the TV thriller released back in 1974 Killdozer.  The tale about a killer bulldozer terrorizing a construction crew.  Possibly one of the worst ever made TV movies.  The Car was much much better. I remember seeing The Car at the movies.  I think it stayed for about a week.  Needless to say the movie was a bomb.  However that does not mean it was a bad movie.  There aren't very many horror movies that are a big success at the movie theatre.  I think they tend to be more successful on video.It's a shame that this movie wasn't more successful because I was looking forward to a sequel.  Who knows maybe they'll release The Car 2 or Son of Car.  All that being said take my advice rent this movie.  Pull up a chair put the lights on low snuggle beside your favorite person wife etc. grab some munchies and no matter what you do make sure you keep that remote in your hand at all times.Sit back and enjoy!".

I found the acting to be a little trying at times.  In fact at times very bad.  I mean having two actors scream at each other in one scene does not create tension it creates confusion.  I like James Brolin in this film and John Marley as well even though he didn't have much to do.The star of the movie is The Car.  What I did not enjoy about the film was as a viewer I did not know anything about the car.  Where did it come from? Why was it there?  Was it the devil?  A demon?  I wanted to know more about this killing machine.  I found that by the end of the film I was still a little confused.  Also I think this movie was a ripoff of the TV thriller released back in 1974 Killdozer.  The tale about a killer bulldozer terrorizing a construction crew.  Possibly one of the worst ever made TV movies.  The Car was much much better. I remember seeing The Car at the movies.  I think it stayed for about a week.  Needless to say the movie was a bomb.  However that does not mean it was a bad movie.  There aren't very many horror movies that are a big success at the movie theatre.  I think they tend to be more successful on video.It's a shame that this movie wasn't more successful because I was looking forward to a sequel.  Who knows maybe they'll release The Car 2 or Son of Car.  All that being said take my advice rent this movie.  Pull up a chair put the lights on low snuggle beside your favorite person wife etc. grab some munchies and no matter what you do make sure you keep that remote in your hand at all times.Sit back and enjoy!";

It terrorises a small Californian town called Santa Ynez Hicksville would be a more appropriate name for it and slaughters several people.James Brolin plays Wade Parent sheriff of the town Well he was deputy sheriff until the hotrod from Hell made a pancake out of his boss.who tries desperately to stop it's reign of vehicular homicide but with very little success. His Biblebashing buddy Luke realises that the car is demonic as it could not harm a crowd that was hiding out in a cemetery. For Brolin the matter becomes personal when the car kills his girlfriend and with the aid of the local wifebeating demolition expert Luke a stereotypical Indian deputy named Chas a squad of firemen turned cops and a motherlode of dynamite he defeats Satan's Street Machine. Or has he? As the credits start rolling we hear the familiar blast of the car's horn and see it driving around somewhere else. Or was there more than one in the first place? That's one of the problems with this film. Many questions are left unanswered. I am willing to believe that the car was indeed demonic but what was it's motive for killing people? Another IMDb user suggested that it was punishing people for their sins. Well the two teens at the start were intending to elope together so I understand that. But the other guys it kills did nothing. The aforementioned wifebeater is left off the hook even by the cops. Okay so he helps them to destroy The Car in the end but that's no guarantee that he won't use his wife for a punching bag again. Also I know that the film is set in a small town but even in a small town since when were the police force allowed to recruit people from the fire department to replace their losses? Did the guys take a crash course in law enforcement as well? At the end of the day who cares? It's just plain harmless fun. Recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "A friend of mine was hesitant to see this movie because she'd heard that it pushes the agenda that divorce is never a good option for dealing with marital problems. I don't really know who told her this and I hope this same reason isn't keeping others from seeing it. This isn't at all what I took away from the film. It certainly communicates the idea that divorce isn't easy on either the parents or the kids but I don't feel that it pronounces judgement on those who turn to it as an option.The Squid and the Whale is a sadthough at times very funnylook at what divorce does to one family in 1986 New York. Jeff Daniels plays the dad a pompous arrogant writer whose feelings of commercial failure he teaches literature at a university cause him to act intellectually superior to everyone he meets. Daniels is almost too good in this role he reminded me way too much of people I actually know who are like this. He's the kind of guy who would be deadly at a dinner party because there's no such thing as a casual or flippant remark in this guy's presence. He analyzes everything to death and isn't content until everyone's opinion matches his own.Laura Linney plays the wayward mom blamed for the break up of the marriage by the dad because of a string of affairs she carries on. Her guilt keeps her from being able to discipline her sons especially the oldest who treats her horribly. Linney's role is smaller but in some ways much more complex than Daniels'. Her character has to take responsibility for her infidelity but still make the audience sympathize with her.Caught in the middle of this mess are their two boys. The oldest quickly allies himself with his dad and walks around regurgitating his father's opinions on every subject rarely pausing to form any of his own. The younger son more sensitive and tired of being intellectually brow beaten by his father and older brother sticks closer to the mom. No one is totally to blame yet no one is completely innocent either in this honest and frank film.Noah Baumbach has made no secret of the fact that it is based on his own adolescent life and it has that confessional feeling that movies in this genre frequently do. There are awkward moments when this doesn't totally work. The ending for one is rather hamfisted and a scene between the oldest son and his school therapist seemed awfully pat to me. But the acting and the sharp writing make up for these weaknesses and the movie manages to be poignant without ever becoming maudlin or overly sentimental.See it for the performances of Linney and especially Daniels who has been proving his versatility as an actor over the last few years.Grade A".

Her guilt keeps her from being able to discipline her sons especially the oldest who treats her horribly. Linney's role is smaller but in some ways much more complex than Daniels'. Her character has to take responsibility for her infidelity but still make the audience sympathize with her.Caught in the middle of this mess are their two boys. The oldest quickly allies himself with his dad and walks around regurgitating his father's opinions on every subject rarely pausing to form any of his own. The younger son more sensitive and tired of being intellectually brow beaten by his father and older brother sticks closer to the mom. No one is totally to blame yet no one is completely innocent either in this honest and frank film.Noah Baumbach has made no secret of the fact that it is based on his own adolescent life and it has that confessional feeling that movies in this genre frequently do. There are awkward moments when this doesn't totally work. The ending for one is rather hamfisted and a scene between the oldest son and his school therapist seemed awfully pat to me. But the acting and the sharp writing make up for these weaknesses and the movie manages to be poignant without ever becoming maudlin or overly sentimental.See it for the performances of Linney and especially Daniels who has been proving his versatility as an actor over the last few years.Grade A";

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. WriterDirector and Wes Anderson collaborator Noah Baumbach presents a semiautobiographical therapy session where he unleashes the anguish and turmoil that has carried over from his childhood. The result is an amazing insight into what many people go through in a desperate attempt to try and make their family work.The casting of Jeff Daniels forces us to view him as the grown up Flap from Terms of Endearment. He has become a bitter unfocused pompous ass of a person father husband and professor. The inability to recapture the magic of his early writing success has caused him to look down on all other writers ... whether they be Fitzgerald or his own wife. This is Daniels' best work ever on screen and is at once painful and a joy to behold.Laura Linney plays his wife as a woman who loves her kids unequivocally and has a zest for life that her downbeat husband no longer shares. Her new found success as a writer sets her off on a trail of confidence and joy all the while understanding that her family still needs her very much.The kids really take the film to the next level. Jessie Eisenberg brilliant in Roger Dodger and Owen Kline son of Kevin Kline and Phoebe Cates are both scene stealers as they struggle in their own distinct ways with their separated parents and their continuance through adolescence. Watching Eisenberg's worship his dad and subsequently realize the truth is just amazing stuff. Kline's outbursts on the tennis court and at the ping pong table are nothing compared to his discovery of alcohol and selfpleasure. The angst and pain these two experience is felt by millions of kids in divorce situations.Other outstanding performances include William Baldwin the one from Backdraft Holly Feifer as Eisenberg's first girlfriend and Anna Paquin underused but still very effective. Baldwin provides some comic relief with his incessant my brother narrative and Feifer is extraordinary in capturing teen adoration as she lusts after Eisenberg. Thanks to her distinct similarity in looks to Linney I laughed outloud when Daniels tells Eisenberg she's not my type.Listening to Daniels try to manipulate everyone he communicates with causes immense dislike among viewers but we can't help but feel some empathy for him as he seems to believe he is doing all he can do put his family back together. His fatherly advice is not to be missed or followed!. Watching him look for the perfect parking place is really his search for his place in a world that has deserted him.Baumbach has created a terrific film and probably exorcised some personal demons along the way. Definitely not a film for the whole family but it offers much insight and many messages. Also the use of the soundtrack is downright brilliant including key music from Pink Floyd and Loudon Wainright.".

Baumbach Jr. on the other hand is a great filmmaker and his movies The Life Aquatic are seen by millions. I'm sure the father is disappointed that the son isn't pursuing tenure at a small Ohio college.I saw this film in a cozy college theater at the Toronto Film Festival.

It was believable well shot great backgrounds all in all a treat for anyone who loves movies and can handle some pretty raw dialogsituations.....and nothing gets blown up.I would recommend this only for adults or a very mature teenager. The language and situations are tough but as I said very believable. I identified with much of what the teens in this movie are going through and my sympathies definitely sided with them against their selfinvolved and selfindulgent parents. This is the best role I've ever seen Jeff Daniels in and having known men in my life like his character I think he was spoton with his portrayal. There were no weak characterizations with any of the actors for that matter.".

	schema:reviewBody "The opening scene hits us with a bunch of characters who are so unlikeable that you may wonder what's the point in watching their lives for 81 minutes. In hindsight and after watching the DVD interview with writerdirector Noah Baumbach I'm sure this was deliberate. By disliking or rather disconnecting from the characters at the outset the audience can take a more objective emotionless view of this dysfunctional familymuch the same way the family approaches itself.So don't expect many weepy scenes where you say to yourself I feel exactly like that character! Because unless you're an egotistical snob of a father who ironically swears like a common sailor at his kids or unless you're the cluelessly devoted son who parrots everything the father says or the passiveaggressive mother who has affairs rather than confront her marital problems or the younger son who seems pretty cool until he inexplicably starts doing disgusting things in the library and I mean disgusting! then I don't think you'll immediately associate with any character in the film. Not the way you might in a standard Hollywood crowd pleaser.If you can make it past that The Squid and the Whale becomes a thoroughly engaging entertaining and at times funny experience. It kept me riveted from start to finish and I found myself wishing it had been longer.A word about the humor don't expect any big gags. In fact in the interview Noah talks about how he had to tell the actors not to read their lines as if they're funny. He didn't intend it to be a comedy but still owing largely to the fantastic deadpan performances by Jeff Daniels  Jesse Eisenberg you might find yourself cracking up at how plain bizarre everything is. Jeff Daniels the father in particular plays such a satirical caricature of a horrible parent that there's no other way to interpret his character than a clown.Something that has to be mentioned is the setting  time period of this film. Brooklyn 1986. Although I'm not a Brooklynite I can speak as an 80s kid who loved all the minor references... clothes hairstyles Burger King collectible glasses at the dinner table and the music! They picked a few gems I probably haven't heard since '86. All of this adds tremendous authenticity to the story and takes you on a sort of fantasy ride. It's hard to believe they got 21st century Brooklyn to look like 1986 on a small indie budget of 1.5 million but I thought it was flawless.On a filmmaking level I noticed some cute nods to the French New Wave school of film handheld cameras swinging back  forth for jarring effect  la Jules  Jim by Truffaut and a general Godardish brooding vibe to the whole presentation while not afraid to show bright vibrant scenes. Whether or not you're a fan of New Wave if you like unconventional camera work you'll probably get a kick out of Noah's approach.Film I would compare this to are the excellent City Island which is on the lighter side The Savages which is on the darker side and The Beaver which is on the mildly psychotic side. Don't hesitate to see any one of them if you get the chance.".

This a wonderful film imbued with a fantastic sense of place and time and small details in which the viewer can find great delight like the hilarious scene where Jeff Daniels takes his teenage son and the kid's new girlfriend to see David Lynch's Blue Velvet instead of the first choice Short Circuit or the closing shot of the actual squid fighting a whale at the NYC Musueum of Natural History.Jeff Daniels is slyly funny as the cheapskate snobbish father who was once the toast of the literary world and is now just getting by on teaching. Laura Linney is again perfection when is she not really as the mother just starting her own brilliant literary career and who is a bit too open about her sexuality with her children. While the parents bicker over custody even the cat gets to skate between two homes the older son acts out by plagiarizing Pink Floyd in a talent show and nervous encounters with girls one of whom is his father's livein studentlover played by the always alluring Anna Paquin and the younger son a very good Owen Klinereal life son of Kevin Kline and Pheobe Cates turns to drinking alone and public masturbation. It's all as awkward real and devastatingly funny as it sounds. A great script and even better acting highlight this tale of a family on the skids. Every member of the family is brilliantly brought to life and even though they are acting in their own flawed selfish selfannihilating and myopic ways they still endear themselves to the audience like they are our own family.Bottom line Only a Philistine would turn down the chance to enjoy The Squid and the Whale.".

	schema:reviewBody "Almost a perfect movie. Everyone needs to see this one.Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney are both extraordinary. Factor in the performances of Jesse Eisenberg and Owen Kline and this may be the most wellacted movie I've seen in a couple of years.I've never enjoyed watching Daniels so much. Kline hits a homerun in his first major role. Eisenberg's performance is Oscarworthy. Yes Daniels is great but Eisenberg earns a Best Supporting Actor nomination in this one!What I enjoyed most of all is how some very VERY delicate humor is brilliantly woven throughout this incredibly sad movie.Cheers to Noah Baumbach for putting his life on paper and letting these terrific actors tell the tale.That's it. Thanks for reading.".

	schema:headline " The break up";
	schema:reviewBody "Noah Baumbach the immensely talented writer and director of The Squid and the Whale clearly demonstrates he is one of the brightest young directors working in America today. Having admired his previous films we were looking forward to this new work in which he presents a part of his life baring his soul something some other movie makers would shy away from. This experience must have been a painful reminder for Mr. Baumbah of his past or maybe it served as a catharsis.If you haven't seen the film please stop reading here.The Berkman household in Park Slope Brooklyn appears to be normal when we are introduced to the family. These are the kinds of parents that encourage their two children participate in discussions in which books are at the center of the conversation. What's more Walt the eldest boy seems to know a lot about what is discussed. Bernard the father is an author that hasn't got a lot of recognition and now teaches college to support the family. Joan the mother also a writer is starting to get her work published. The two sons Walt and Frank are clever beyond their years.Evidently not all seems to be happy in the house. First one notices Bernard making the couch in the morning in which he has slept in order to ease his back problems. Joan is a supporting mother but somehow she appears to be distant. Both parents sit with the kids one night to tell them about their impending separation. Of course this takes Frank and especially Frank aback by the announcement. The semblance of a tightly knit family begins to unravel in front of the children's eyes.For Walt the situation is not as crucial as it is for Frank. Being older and being a city kid Walt has seen this happening among his age group. For Frank however his parents break up is the end of the world as he knew it. Both boys are resilient in accepting the situation. It's clear Bernard and Joan love their sons but the idea of not having both parents around at the same time is devastating.The Squid and the Whale is a film that lays bare the emotions the two boys are experiencing. Basically it's their film as it shows how they have to adjust to the new circumstances. They both adore their parents but the resentment is clear as they blame Bernard and Joan for daring to fall out of love and in a way abandon them to a new reality the older Berkmans didn't prepared them for.The quality of the acting Mr. Baumbach gets from this ensemble cast is absolutely amazing. We believe we are in a way intruding in this family's problems. We are voyeurs to the tragedy their separation presents for the boys. Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney are perfect as the elder Berkmans. Mr. Daniels especially gives an inspired performance for his take of the stingy Bernard. Ms. Linney one of our best actresses is marvelous as Joan.What the director has done with the young actors Jesse Eisenberg and Owen Kline is something incredible. We can't think of any other director that could have accomplished what Noah Baumbach has in guiding them to make the great contribution both these teen agers gave to the film. Both actors are up to the task and there are never a false move from anyone of them.The supporting cast is interesting. William Baldwin plays the tennis pro Ivan. Anna Paquin is good as Lili Bernard's student that is wiser than her young years indicate. Halley Feiffer is perfectly sweet as Sophie who likes Walt.The film has been photographed in a faded technique by Robert Yeoman that gives the film a nostalgic look. The musical score is fine reflecting the era in which the movie takes place.The movie is a triumph for Noah Baumbah who clearly shows he is an unique voice for these times.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'll go a head and warn my review contains SPOILERS so if you haven't seen the film I then READ AT YOUR OWN RISK....I went into the squid and the whale excited but realistic about my expectations for the film. I was impressed by Jesse Eisenberg in Roger Dodger and have always respected Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney and with Noah Baumbach helming I figured the movie was in capable hands. However I did fear that after viewing the trailer that I had already seen the best squid had to offer. In some ways I was right. Firstly it deserves praise for it's portrayal of adolescent males. I found a lot of truth in Franks character. The scenes in which he studies himself in the mirror reminded me greatly of the same self absorbed and curious qualities I had at that stage in my life. However Baumbach played some of Franks sexual exploits and dirty language in a exploitive manner. The way he was portrayed made his character too much of a tool to shock the audience. In fact many scenes depicting sexuality seemed thrown in. The line were Bernard says to Lili Put me in your mouth was petty and did little to reinforce any character traits that weren't already glaringly clear. I have no problem with risqu dialog or scenes that show characters in a despicable light. However that scene in particular seemed hollow. Bernard or Lili were not developed enough for me to really care that he would say something so rude to her. I already got that he was a self absorbed loathing character. If Baumbach had used that line to trigger a stronger response in any of the three characters involved it would have felt natural. Instead we see nothing of Lili after and Walt didn't meditate very long after hearing something so low come from his father's mouth. I understand Bernard was a jerk and used similar language around Walt. But still it was far harsher then anything he uttered before or after. Yet no one seemed to really notice. I could see how combined with the final argument and Bernard's self absorbed lines in the hospital it could justify Walt to see his parents in a clearer light. Yet Baumbach let the moment pass to quickly missing what could have been a stronger beat. Which brings me to my main problem with the film. Baumbach's pacing never lets the audience into the characters heads. He throws things at you and the characters so fast that neither you nor they seem to have the time to let the emotions sink in. The number one thing that troubled me however was the ending. I understand that Walt mentions he could never look at the squid and the whale fighting but come on! To have him go and look at a giant squid and the whale fight as a way to end the movie? Please not only do I always question movies that use the title as a line in the film that is really important to the story but to have something as petty and unemotional as a character looking at a science sculpture! If it had been better shot it may have work however I didn't even have the time to let the emotions of the scene sink in before I was slammed with a big Title Card!!! Honestly I felt I was watching an unfinished film and that the editor didn't know what to do so they just put a title card to let the audience know yes that was all folks! One other thing I found useless was the gag although no one laughed where Joan comes out of the bathroom and the Walt says something about the nasty smell. Why include this? Was it funny? No! Was it important to the story scene or characters? No! All it did was leave a foul taste in my mouth for no reason. Still for as much as I've said what didn't work Squid does have some good things going for it. I'd like to thank the whole crew for making a film about people and human relationships in a time when so many movies seem to be about nothing more then eye candy. Also big props to all the actors for fine performances. Squid and the Whale is a much stronger film then most which is why I was so disappointed that it couldn't rise above it's problems to be something truly special.".

	schema:headline " Literary autobiography with heartfelt humor Daniels' career best and Oscar worthy";
	schema:reviewBody "THE SQUID AND THE WHALE 2005  Jeff Daniels Laura Linney Jessie Eisenberg Owen Kline Anna Paquin William Baldwin. Literary autobiography with heartfelt humor.Filmmaker Noah Baumbach is back in fine form since his debut with the excellent Kicking and Screaming a personal fave of mine a Diner for the '90s in this semiautobiographical account of his family's dealing with his parent's divorce with bittersweet frankness and a heaping of witty humor.The family Berkman of Park Slope Brooklyn circa the early 1980s consists of authorteacher Bernard Daniels in a career high performance that deserves an Oscar nod literary pursuant mother Joan Linney sublimely good and sons Walt and Frank Eisenberg and Kline the latter the progeny of Kevin Kline and Phoebe Cates making a Culkinian debut with surprising chops aka Chicken and Pickle their mom's nicknames. The quartet is harmonious in literary pursuits and drastic life changes when the parents agree on separating sending the boys and ultimately themselves into an emotional tailspin.Bernard a very sardonic critical yet loving man is taking it very internally despite his sarcastic remarks about everything to his sons as a sounding board in his attempt to keep his boys together by a joint custody agreement with Joan by taking a fixerupper brownstone across the park while he deals with the likelihood that his new book will never be published. Joan's affairs are discovered shockingly by the boys  Walt the more avuncularly bitter lashing out and blaming her for not giving the marriage a chance reasoning that dad's lack of success has made her seek another shot a life of empty sex yet promise in her undiscovered writing talents much to the resentment of Bernard meanwhile budding tennis pro wannabe Frank the youngest begins to experiment with alcohol and masturbation.Added to the mix is Lili Paquin a female writing student of Bernard's who has a hidden agenda when Bernard invites her to share his new home as a roommate while the boys visit every other day with mixed results. Walt is attempting to begin a sexual awakening as well with his first girlfriend but is getting all the wrong comic advice from Bernard who is clueless with the opposite sex as he is also trying to have sex with Lili while burning over Joan who has hooked up with Frank's tennis instructor Ivan a doofy Baldwin whose every other utterance is Brother.Achingly funny sharply witty and skewering with some pricelessly amusing moments including the running gag of Bernard driving his kids around the neighborhood my space is missing! an apt metaphor for his listless situation and subtle touches Bernard reading Saul Bellow's THE VICTIM and the new home decorated with posters of films like PSYCHO and THE MOTHER AND THE WHORE and using the instrumental theme of Tangerine Dream's score to Risky Business during Frank's sexual awakenings!  bring a smile if not a burst of laughter in the unease of a family's reluctant transition that will scar them forever.Baumbach is clearly making a heartfelt valentine to his own upbringing when his parents eventually divorced during his trying teens and the affects that have rubbed off are bittersweet and universally humorous. He has a keen touch with his actors  especially Daniels the centerpiece character who is brilliantly funny touching and headshaking misanthropic at the absurdity of his situation at one point he says glibly with a touch of melancholy that's my home which I used to live inas you may know to his son during one of their jaunts back and forth that has echoes of his first fine role as Flap the philandering English professor husband of the doomed Debra Winger in Terms of Endearment suggesting a bookend to what Flap may have become ultimately and I'm damned if I'm not right at one point Walt is looking at his father's novel's backflap and the photo suggests a still from that film!. Bernard genuinely cares for his family but does things in such an assbackward and frugal way that it is borderline heartbreaking especially his confounded loss of his status both professionally and familially that at one point I welled up with tears as he caressed a shelve of books while dropping Frank off with his mom. Daniels has always been one of my alltime faves and a severely underrated and underestimated actor it's be criminal if he didn't get an Academy Award nomination.There are some very funny moments throughout with the brothers particularly Frank's stream of profanities in frustration at the tennis lessons no doubt from his competitive father in several sequences and Walt's stonecold declaration that the musical piece he will be performing Pink Floyd's Hey You was written by him as an original work! Baumbach has crafted some fine work over the years the aforementioned masterpiece of Kicking  Screaming about recent college grad buds deliberately not accepting their new status in the 'real world' by refusing to adapt and his recent collaboration with executive producer and fellow auteur Wes Anderson on last year's equally sublimely funnysad The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and his latest a blend of Salinger and Updike suggests a novella come to life and one of the year's finest comedic dramas.".

The quartet is harmonious in literary pursuits and drastic life changes when the parents agree on separating sending the boys and ultimately themselves into an emotional tailspin.Bernard a very sardonic critical yet loving man is taking it very internally despite his sarcastic remarks about everything to his sons as a sounding board in his attempt to keep his boys together by a joint custody agreement with Joan by taking a fixerupper brownstone across the park while he deals with the likelihood that his new book will never be published. Joan's affairs are discovered shockingly by the boys  Walt the more avuncularly bitter lashing out and blaming her for not giving the marriage a chance reasoning that dad's lack of success has made her seek another shot a life of empty sex yet promise in her undiscovered writing talents much to the resentment of Bernard meanwhile budding tennis pro wannabe Frank the youngest begins to experiment with alcohol and masturbation.Added to the mix is Lili Paquin a female writing student of Bernard's who has a hidden agenda when Bernard invites her to share his new home as a roommate while the boys visit every other day with mixed results. Walt is attempting to begin a sexual awakening as well with his first girlfriend but is getting all the wrong comic advice from Bernard who is clueless with the opposite sex as he is also trying to have sex with Lili while burning over Joan who has hooked up with Frank's tennis instructor Ivan a doofy Baldwin whose every other utterance is Brother.Achingly funny sharply witty and skewering with some pricelessly amusing moments including the running gag of Bernard driving his kids around the neighborhood my space is missing! an apt metaphor for his listless situation and subtle touches Bernard reading Saul Bellow's THE VICTIM and the new home decorated with posters of films like PSYCHO and THE MOTHER AND THE WHORE and using the instrumental theme of Tangerine Dream's score to Risky Business during Frank's sexual awakenings!  bring a smile if not a burst of laughter in the unease of a family's reluctant transition that will scar them forever.Baumbach is clearly making a heartfelt valentine to his own upbringing when his parents eventually divorced during his trying teens and the affects that have rubbed off are bittersweet and universally humorous. He has a keen touch with his actors  especially Daniels the centerpiece character who is brilliantly funny touching and headshaking misanthropic at the absurdity of his situation at one point he says glibly with a touch of melancholy that's my home which I used to live inas you may know to his son during one of their jaunts back and forth that has echoes of his first fine role as Flap the philandering English professor husband of the doomed Debra Winger in Terms of Endearment suggesting a bookend to what Flap may have become ultimately and I'm damned if I'm not right at one point Walt is looking at his father's novel's backflap and the photo suggests a still from that film!. Bernard genuinely cares for his family but does things in such an assbackward and frugal way that it is borderline heartbreaking especially his confounded loss of his status both professionally and familially that at one point I welled up with tears as he caressed a shelve of books while dropping Frank off with his mom. Daniels has always been one of my alltime faves and a severely underrated and underestimated actor it's be criminal if he didn't get an Academy Award nomination.There are some very funny moments throughout with the brothers particularly Frank's stream of profanities in frustration at the tennis lessons no doubt from his competitive father in several sequences and Walt's stonecold declaration that the musical piece he will be performing Pink Floyd's Hey You was written by him as an original work! Baumbach has crafted some fine work over the years the aforementioned masterpiece of Kicking  Screaming about recent college grad buds deliberately not accepting their new status in the 'real world' by refusing to adapt and his recent collaboration with executive producer and fellow auteur Wes Anderson on last year's equally sublimely funnysad The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and his latest a blend of Salinger and Updike suggests a novella come to life and one of the year's finest comedic dramas.";

Now I am positive that not all broken homes are this broken but Noah Baumbauch creates an environment that makes you squirm and want to cry all at the same time. All of the performances are near perfection and are executed with utmost conviction. I find that Jeff Daniels is one of those actors who get better with every movie he does. He is completely unlikeable in this movie yet you feel for him and you want him to get it together. Very few actors can play a prick and yet you are rooting for him and there are a few points in the film where you even buy into his bullshit as much as his oldest son played by Jesse Eisenberg does. The Squid and The Whale is not the most uplifting of fare but it is a must view for anybody who appreciates film not movies film.".

Boy was I disappointed.The movie is set in the 1980s in Brooklyn and is about a divorce between two writers and how the separation affects everyone in the family including their two boys. Everyone hurts everyone they all cuss at each other they're all having sex with someone inappropriate or masturbating in public. The job does a good job at making you feel uncomfortable and maybe that's the point of the movie. Usually though there is a point to the movie. What's the point of this one? Divorce is hard? Well everyone knows that. It was predictable and just boring with a crass overtone. I started cutting mosaic tiles in the middle of the movie because it was so boring and predictable. It was definitely not an enjoyable film or even thoughtprovoking. It didn't even do a good job at making me feel depressed if that was what it was supposed to do although it did make me mad at my sister for recommending this stupid film which was a definite waste of my two hours.".

	schema:reviewBody "Screenwriter and director Noah Baumbach's tale of his incredibly dysfunctional family could easily have been renamed The Addams Family  1986. The film recounts his ugly childhood with his younger brother his writerfather and aspiring writermother living in Park Slope Brooklyn in 1986. His father Bernard played revoltingly well by Jeff Daniels has absolutely no concept of what's going on outside of his own world as he spews obscenities and dwells on his past as a respected writer of course now no one wants anything to do with his writing so he teaches English instead Gee haven't we see that a few hundred times in films?Bernard's wife Joan played by a mousy Laury Linney decide that after many years of marriage that divorce is the best option which seems odd considering that they have nothing good to say about each other and that Joan has had affairs with at least four different men during their marriage. Why they don't continue with this nightmarish marriage isn't explained there isn't a catalyst for this decision. Once the separation occurs and Bernard relocates several blocks away to a house of lesser amenities the film shifts focus to the effect the separation has on the two children Walt and Frank Berkman. Walt played by a browfurrowed Jesse Eisenberg idolizes his father and models his view of the world after Bernard's twisted vision. The majority of observations from Walt's mouth are direct quotes from his father yet instead of revealing the depth of admiration Walt has for his father these comments simply show Walt as being shallow and pathetic. We wait for Walt to develop a mind of his own but sadly that never happens. Frank played mincingly by Owen Kline steals the film as the repulsive chronic masturbator who leaves his calling card on any nonhuman surface. At one point Joan and Bernard get their child custody duties mixed up and accidentally leave Frank alone for three days. Frank spends the time drinking Scotch masturbating to his mom's underwear and passing out on the bathroom floor. The next scene is Joan and Bernard being confronted by the school counselor. What happened for the rest of Frank's long weekend? A nine year old boy left alone with hard liquor and a Oedipal complex is a film in itself but we aren't allowed to witness this or a scene where the parents find Frank near death from alcohol poisoning assuming that could have easily happened lying in a pile of his mother's panties. The rest of the film is filled with Walt's blatant plagiarism a nonstop stream of offensive cursing arguments premature ejaculation Bernard allowing his dinner guests at restaurants to only order halforders because he's so cheap unbelievable therapy sessions Bernard trying to force his female student and border to perform oral sex only to be interrupted by his son and a medical emergency that is offered as redemption but fails. Contrary to reviews I've read there is nothing charming endearing funny or clever about this film. It truly boggles my mind that most critics enjoyed this film. The only reason I can conjure is that most of these critics were raised in a family as hellish as this one so it's like spending time with old heavily medicated friends. If this film's final scene was of the four Berkman's going for a hot air balloon ride over the Catskills and the balloon crashing in flames into the mountains with no survivors then I just might have walked out of the theater with a smile on my face. As it is this a slice of American ugliness that no one should have to endure.".

	schema:headline " Psychological War of the Roses";
	schema:reviewBody "When husband and wife decide to split the only ones who get hurt are the children and even though Joan and Bernard Berkman are in the center of their nasty divorce their two sons  Frank and Walt  are the ones going through the trauma. Noah Baumbach wrote and directed this insightful biting story of a family deadlocked in its inner battles based on his own life experiences and the result is bittersweet.Bernard claims to have been an influential author of novels who has fallen on hard times. Frank idolizes him and has the same clipped insolent tones as if he were talking to an admiring audience. Bernard openly attacks his wife Joan as if it were a requisite for their marriage to exist and Frank decides he too can't stand her. On the other hand Joan once Bernard casually reveals her affair with a neighbor is coming into her own as a writer and as selfish as she may seem at times she's the better person in the marriage. Walt the youngest son tilts towards her but is going through his own inner changes and is expressing it through masturbation  especially on library books and his mother's lingerie.After the Berkman's separate Bernard and the boys move into the new house  a rickety place within the vicinity  and Joan initiates her life with Ivan Walt's tennis tutor. A quadrangle and a triangle of sorts develops when Bernard rents a room to one of his female students Lili and begins a tentative affair with her. Frank who is going out with a girl he seems embarrassed to be seen with also pines and almost succeeds in seducing Lili. His father even encourages it. Events involving Bernard's and Joan's war eventually lead to a nasty head which will make Frank take a decision about himself.What makes THE SQUID AND THE WHALE such a great little film is how natural it seems at all turns and how slice of life it is. I kept getting references from French New Wave all over the place. Baumbach writes his characters like real people at all times. Bernard's relationship with his sons is real. Look at when he and Walt curse over losing a table tennis match in almost exact verbal intonations or when both he and Frank lock themselves in their elitist world and chatter about Kafka how Bernard has decided he was once a brilliant writer which may or not be true and how A Tale of Two Cities was a lesser Dickens as if reading it meant getting an eye infection. Frank in imitating his father's worst traits when it is discovered that a song he'd written was in fact a song by Pink Floyd and in a Ted Bundy style argues that it was as if he had written it so it was his by appropriation exposes him for the empty snob he is on the inside. Joan while a little unsympathetic here and there is a real human and one who maintains her composure when its clear her writing career is on the rise even if her family is about to implode. When she propitiates the demise of her family it's at first seen as an act of selfish abandonment but one look at Bernard and his abrasive selfobsessed hurtful personality and all is explained. Now Walt has a more internal character development despite some verbal outbursts at the beginning of the movie. Once the family is divided and he is left increasingly alone his psyche begins delving into his own sexual awakening which under the detached music of Tangerine Dream is seen as something he himself doesn't understand. It's clear he's more tolerant of the two brothers and able to accept Ivan  an much better guy as his mother's new guy.There's also an interesting subtext involving the film BLUE VELVET that may or nor may be intentional. While Frank invites his father to see SHORT CIRCUIT his father arrogantly puts that film down for being commercial and decides they will see BLUE VELVET. The climactic scene where the main characters converge at the Williams' household seems to open a door to Frank's sexual fascination with brunettes and fuses his progressive revulsion of Sophie a dead ringer for Laura Dern. The appearance of the darkhaired Lili increases this  she holds within a similar mystique that lures Frank and leads him to push Sophie away in a painful scene.THE SQUID AND THE WHALE is a sharp domestic drama about bitter people caught within their own patterns of behavior and it lingers on after its abrupt but symbolic ending. Even with Walt's forays into bizarre behavior which is not as disturbing as a part of a boy's growth it's Frank  Noah Baumbach's apparent alterego  who has the moment of clarity to see things as they really are and not be a figment of his father's poison. The moment he realizes he has been a pawn in a needless war between Bernard and Bernard  not Bernard and Joan as initially depicted he does what anyone would have done run and let his feet and instinct take him to the truth.And as is the case with these kinds of movies all of the performances are ontarget. Laura Linney continues on her winning streak of textured modern women. Jeff Daniels made me feel like I was in the presence of a real jerk who could have a moment of sympathy but chose to remain locked in his delusions and that takes guts. Ditto of Jesse Eisenberg who at times reminded me of Ted Bundy. Anna Paquin and William Baldwin fill out believable people with their minimal scenes and Owen Kline made me think of an adult trapped in a kid's body. Overall this is a nearperfect film from start to finish.".

	schema:headline " So horrible.";
	schema:reviewBody "Ugh. The other reviews note that this story is based on Noah Baumbach's own story of his parent's divorce. But if it's true does that make him the plagiarizer or the pottymouthed serial masturbator? It's hard to imagine anyone wanting to immortalize their family with these sloppily constructed clichd caricatures of the sort of people you might have found in Park Slope in the 80's. The parents exhibit a reprehensible lack of concern for their kids as they finally arrive at divorce. The mother character is not expanded much beyond showing that she bore her dissatisfaction with her husband by having numerous affairs times during the course of the marriage. The father character is shown as an insecure blowhard affected more by his wife's professional success than by her infidelities. The children are essentially little versions of their parents and are emotionally victimized by each of the parents in their supposed struggle to cope with their divorce. They develop disturbing habits which are illaddressed by the parents who are too busy wallowing in their own miseries to effectively address their children's' unspoken cries for help.This poor character development  overabundance of unseemly airing of personal grievance make this film feel like a student film. A BAD student film.On the up side Park Slope was perfectly captured  portrayed instantly recognizable. I don't know how a big a deal that is considering that it hasn't changed all that much since.This film was a disappointment.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was billed as a comedy. It wasn't. Unless it's funny to watch miserable irrevocably damaged people doing horrible things to each other themselves their children and your own youthful idealism. For me it was like getting poked in the eye with a pencil  over and over. I kept standing there expectant hopeful naive thinking maybe I wouldn't get poked in the eye any more times but inevitably it came  the eye poke.The movie is a long gauntlet of awkward situations and unforgettably dreadful moments. There is no forgiveness no redemption no hope  there is only wound heaped upon scar from parent to child and back again and from spouse to spouse  kind of like the tennis that is a motif in the film. If you feel the need to cringe here is your opportunity. I don't think my shoulders relaxed once throughout the movie although their were many times when I stopped cringing with horror in order to clutch my mouth and say He did NOT just dosay that. I am not a person who needs things to be all joyful or demands the happy ending. I have never said nor will I ever say Can't we all just get along? However tomorrow is my ninth wedding anniversary and this movie makes marriage parenthood or really any relationship at all with another person just seem like a toxic prison from which there is no escape but nihilism. NEAT! Happy anniversary to me!! For what it's worth I also predicted everything that happened in the film as we went through it including the development of the motif in the title. It was predictable in the wide view but as for the many little barbs and spears that are thrown along the way  unless you're as bloodless and depraved as the characters in the movie you'll never see them coming.I think as a side note this is the best acting Jeff Daniels has ever done. Pity it's in such a bambooshootsunderthefingernails of a movie.".
