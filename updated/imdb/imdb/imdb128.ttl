Only the most jaded cynic imaginable could not be charmed by this film.The songs are perfect the cinematography the set direction costumes everything really  MGM movie magic at its best!  Vincente Minelli did a superlative job of direction and the cast simply could not be bettered. Judy Garland gives what I feel is the most relaxed and charming performance of her career and sings like an angel not like the jittery bundle of nerves she would become in later life.  Tom Drake is very winning as the Boy Next Door we should all be so lucky to have.  But Margaret O'Brien absolutely steals the picture as the adorable but irrepressibly morbid Tootie a refreshing change from the normally saccharine moppets of Hollywood's golden years.  Marjorie Main also swipes  a scene or two as the mouthy cook and Mary Astor and Leon Ames give sterling support as the parents.  Their makeup scene at the piano is beautifully done.What a wonderful antidote this movie is when you need to retreat from the harsh world and have your spirits lifted for a while.".

	schema:headline " Judy Garland never looked better";
	schema:reviewBody "This is such a sweet wonderful movie  a slice of 1900's America that probably was never so perfect but we would like to think that it was.  The storyline is not a love story between Esther Garland and The Boy Next Door one of the three timeless classic songs found in this movie.  The storyline is really about the whole Smith family based on an actual family who lived in St. Louis at the turn of the century.  The reallife Tootie Smith played by Margaret O'Brien wrote stories of her life for the NewYorker.  These stories were bought and compiled into this classic musical.  Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas originated here and has become a classic yuletide song.  It has been sung a thousand times by a thousand artists but no one could ever capture the heartfelt emotion expressed by Judy Garland.  If it doesn't bring a tear to your eye as you listen to her sing the song to little Tootie I would have to wonder if you have a heart at all.The most fun song is The Trolley Song  you can even see that Judy herself had a ball singing it.  That scene was done in one take.Judy Garland never looked better in any of her films as she did in this one. Perhaps it was one of the happiest times in her life?  It is wellknown that she married director Vincent Minelli after this picture.Beautifully directed depicting with accuracy the passing of the seasons of one year in the life of the Smiths of St. Louis.  What a fun charming movie.  I could never tire of it.".

	schema:headline " Minnelli Directs Garland In MGM Classic";
	schema:reviewBody "The day was bright The air was sweet The smell of honeysuckle almost knocked you off your feet ...  This is unashamed nostalgia for an idealised America dating back to an age of innocence before the two World Wars.It is 1903 and the city of St. Louis is ablaze with excitement as it prepares to host the World's Fair.  Here in the geographic heart of the USA the very pleasant Smith family lives in a very pleasant suburb of the very pleasant St. Louis. We watch the Smiths through the seasons and into Spring 1904 as they fall in love dress up for Hallowe'en bottle their homemade ketchup and .... well ride the trolley.This is a world of tranquillity where nothing can threaten the homely complacency of Middle America.  The evening meal is always a wholesome family gathering the month of July is always sunny big brothers are always handsome Princeton freshmen and the iceman's mare knows the neighbourhood so well that she stops at each home on her round without needing to be told. The only shadow which falls across the Smiths' domestic bliss comes when Alonzo the paterfamilias proposes to move the household to New York. However Alonzo soon realises what a terrible mistake it would be to tear his wife and daughters away from their beloved MidWest he relents and family harmony is restored.This heartwarming exuberant musical is one of the very best ever made and MGM knew exactly what it was doing in terms of box office success.  The film was calculated to cash in on the zeitgeist of 1944 the year in which vast American armies were sent across to Europe and the war in the Pacific turned decisively in America's favour.  Millions of young American men found themselves far from home in what was certain to be the last Christmas of the War and millions of families back home missed them terribly  Some day soon we all will be together If the fates allow.  Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow ...In this idealised America everyone is prosperous everyone conducts himself like a good citizen should old folks are cheerful healthy and alert domestic servants feign grumpiness but actually adore their masters and teenage girls are flirtatious but impeccably proper.  There are strong American folkresonances in the homespun wisdom of the family elders the strong straight young adults and the 'down home' hearthside gatherings and dances.  It could be argued that the film invokes an America that has never in fact existed.  This maybe so but the Perfect America which we experience here exerts an emotional pull far stronger than any real place could command.Vincente Minnelli directed the movie with panache.  There are many subtle but sure touches  for example two short scenes  which establish the proposition that the family's happiness is inextricably linked to St. Louis. Alonzo announces the move to New York and with clever choreography Minnelli turns him into a pariah in his own livingroom.  Esther and Tootie gaze at the snowmen which they will have to abandon in the yard and we know without any dialogue to help us that the eastward migration isn't going to happen.  With similar cinematic economy Minnelli shows us the happy commotion around the Christmas tree without allowing it to distract our attention from Alonzo and Anna whose wordless reconciliation sets the seal on the plot.  This is directing of rare skill.In films of the 1960's and 70's a stock device was used a sepiatinted photograph would 'come to life' with colour and motion to show that the scene was laid in the past.  Minnelli employs the trick elegantly in this film and I am not aware of any example which predates this one.This is a 'formula' movie but its ingredients are so fine and they are combined with such marvellous skill that the whole eclipses the parts. Among the elements which contribute to the project's success are the songs  and the film contains three classics The Trolley Song Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas and of course Meet Me In St. Louis.Judy Garland was 22 years old when she made this film though she easily passes for a 17yearold and it was this movie which cemented her relationship with Minnelli.  They married one year later and Liza was born in March 1946.Predictably enough the film has a happy ending.  The teenage girls Esther and Rose are paired off and the Smiths get to visit the World's Fair as one big happy family.  As they look for the restaurant once again a meal signifies domestic harmony they are distracted by the lightingup of the city a filmic metaphor for the approaching end of World War Two.  The sisters are filled with awe at America's technological ascendancy and that such miracles can be achieved by such folksy simple people  Right here where we live right here in St. Louis!".

	schema:headline " The Happiness of Not MovingAt Least for Now";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the greatest movie musicals and thus one of the greatest American movies Meet Me in St. Louis tells a story that may appear insultingly inconsequential a happy family living in turnofthecentury St. Louis considers moving to New York but decides against it. Yet Vincente Minelli working with a wonderful cast and unusually intelligent songs takes this story and makes it the one really convincing screen refutation of Tolstoy's claim that all happy families are alike and indeed perhaps the only fully rounded and persuasive representation of a happy family in the history of movies. From the small family conflict over the quality of homemade ketchup that begins the movie to the agony over moving at the end the Smiths are a collection of distinctive vibrant and at times almost incompatible characters bound together not only by love but by a contagious and very particular sense of fun. Minelli's genius for musical numbers in interior spacesmost notably the great party in the Smith home near the beginning of the movieis complemented here by two unforgettable outdoor sequences Judy Garland's matchless Trolley Song and Tootie's Halloween adventure in the neighborhood where she shows such vulnerability such courageand in the end such diabolical lack of conscience that no one can fail to love her. These outdoor scenes protect Meet in St. Louis from the claustrophobia that so frequently limits the power of family dramas.Tootie at five is the youngest of the five Smith children and as played by the great child actor Margaret O'Brien she is also the center of most of the fun. Her relationship with her older sister Esther Judy Garland is captivating in its joy complexity and ultimately in its sadness. For even though the catastrophe ! of moving to New York is narrowly avoided Esther will still leave home for life with the boy next door and the powerful unity of these lucky people will ultimately give way to other claims of new love new suffering and new duty. The happiness the Smiths knew while living together will only increase the pain of each parting. We're blessed though to have glimpsed their particular brand of happiness at its glorious peak.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd seen this film several times as a child before studying it in earnest as part of a college film class. Now nearly 20 years past I look more at the nuances and subtleties of the performances and direction in a movie that seems easy to characterize as sentimental. Indeed the vibrant color the relatively simple plot contrivances and the resolution of the big question of the movie all make for what seems superficially like a film for fans of Corny Musicals.Let me argue against sap for the main reason that a deep undercurrent of real and heartfelt emotion underlies the entire enterprise. And the credit can be spread wide for that 1. The rich and subtle performance of Judy Garland who does not miss a step a note a glance or an inflection throughout the entire movie. For many la Judy can be an acquired taste but she shows her stuff here. Watch her primping at the mirror with Rose watching Tootie as she sings Dear Mother or in the scene where The Boy tells her he can't get his tuxedo out of the cleaners. She was a marvelous actor and it shows in the small scenes as well as the grand singing ones. Her transition from worry and disappointment to exuberance in The Trolley Song is a wonder to behold.2. Margaret O'Brien as Tootie and also the writer's characterization of Tootie here is a child who is not nice or cute the way TVMovie kids are today. But she is compelling and wonderful in own right  a real flesh and blood kid. In particular the Halloween scene really shows the dark side of childhood where scary fantasies can become real and the depths of her despair at leaving St. Louis capture the essence of leaving everything that is familiar and right.3. The acting company is so wonderful from the smallest supporting actor to the largest role there is a give and take note the passing of the title song from person to person at the beginning of the film and the easy banter the dinner table interactions the scene where everyone finds out about the Big Move and you get a sense that this is a real family.4. The integration and the transition from the emotion of the scene directly into the emotion of the song and then back to the scene is repeated again and again. This is not an easy thing to do and for all I can recall Minnelli was the first to master it. Most musicals would stop dead in the their tracks to do a song but the music here is so organic and truthful you hardly notice the strings moving in the background.5. And don't get me started on the score which is really wonderful echoing the various themes at just the perfect moment. The Halloween bonfire music is especially good. I think credit goes to George Stoll for that.6. And for putting the package together a tip of the hat to Vincente Minnelli and Arthur Freed who went on to do many wonderful musicals but none perhaps as wonderful as this one. Minnelli works magic with staging the Skip to My Lou and Trolley Song are wonderful group numbers and it must have been true love that helped Judy Garland's wonderful performance.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd never seen this movie until a few weeks ago. After I rented it from Netflix last month I still have it but I plan to buy my own copy soon I saw it on AMC. Has it been on TV before? I mean I've known of its existence because I've seen the title in the sheet music for Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. I heard James Taylor talk about the movie in an interview after he recorded that song in response to 911 and I've been wanting to see it ever since. Now I've become a MMISL junkie. I can't stop watching it! I've read everything I can find on the Internet about it and about the St. Louis World's Fair which is absolutely fascinatingdid you know that one of the pavilions featured actual premature babies in incubators? and I just started reading Sally Benson's original book. For those who complain that this film is some kind of idealized or fantasized representation of life in America I say read the book. It's based on Sally Benson's actual recollections of growing up in St. Louis and the movie dialogue and situations are lifted almost word for word from the book. It jibes pretty well with other things I've read about the era and with stories I've heard my parents and grandparents tell so I have no trouble believing it at all. Actually the situations and relationships are not that different from what families face today at least the normal twoparentsoftheoppositesex kind that I'm familiar with. Just listen to Mrs. Smith tell her husband to count to three before responding to his daughter. He counts to three and shouts at her anyway! As for Mr. Smith giving up a lucrative career move for the sake of his family's happiness and wellbeing how many parents have not faced similar decisions?I think there are five main reasons I like this movie 1. Judy Garland. She's just one of the greatest performers of the 20th century that's all there is to it. 2. Margaret O'Brien. What a joy to watch on the screen. Now I know why she was one of the most beloved child stars in America. 3. The wonderful songs. It doesn't get much better than The Trolley Song The Boy Next Door and Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. 4. The beautiful Technicolor cinematography. In the DVD version the colors are so brilliant that it looks like it could have been filmed yesterday. And Rose and Esther's clothes are simply stunning. I especially love the Oriental? robes they wear at home. 5. Last but not least I enjoy its refreshingly positive upbeat take on family life and life in these United States. I just wish I hadn't had to wait fifty years to see this sixtyyearold movie!".

The brilliantly talented Vincente Minneli has created in this film an irresistible homage to home and family circa 190304 with the added piece de resistance of Judy Garland singing some of her most wellknown and beloved songs The Boy Next Door The Trolley Song and Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. Beautiful!Garland is the supreme entertainer of her generation and possibly for all time. She can relate a song to her audience and make them feel what is in her heart. Nowhere in St. Louis is this more clear than in her rendition of Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas  a carol with obvious tearjerking sadness and poignancy. However the film's most exuberant display of joyous passion remains 'The Trolley Song'. At any rate enjoy! This is one film that never gets old and Judy Garland was never more beautiful than she was right here.".

	schema:reviewBody "A lot of the Hollywood studios during the War years made these nostalgic films about a simpler time when no foreign foe threatened our way of life. MGM's contribution to these films was not bettered served than by Meet Me In St. Louis. It's a simple story about the Smith family in 1904 St. Louis eagerly awaiting the World's Fair that would take place in their town. And to my knowledge no other World's Fair had as enduring a theme song as the one written for this fair serving as the title song for the film.The Smith family consists of parents Leon Ames and Mary Astor and their five children son Henry Daniels Jr. and daughters in descending order Lucille Bremer Judy Garland Joan Carroll and Margaret O'Brien. Grandfather Harry Davenport lives with the clan and so does livein maid Marjorie Main who functions like Alice in the Brady household. A good meal and an occasional wisecrack to keep everyone in line.Everyone's excited about the upcoming fair St. Louis's rival city Chicago had one a decade earlier and Buffalo did three years earlier but this one promises to be the most extravagant of all. Ames gets an opportunity in business and wants to move the family to New York but one by one the family has or develops obligations and ties to St. Louis that makes them reluctant to leave. Not to mention they don't want to miss the fair.Vincente Minnelli directed Meet Me In St. Louis and it was his first opportunity to work with Judy Garland whom he would marry after the film was finished. Judy got to do three of her most identified songs from the Hugh MartinRalph Blane score that was blended with some traditional music of the times. The Boy Next Door Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas and The Trolley Song all come out of Meet Me In St. Louis and were staple items at Garland concerts for years. One of the Oscar nominations that Meet Me In St. Louis received was for The Trolley Song for Best Original Song. It lost to Bing Crosby's Swinging On A Star that year. The other nominations were for musical scoring color cinematography and screenplay.Margaret O'Brien did a remarkable job in this film this was probably her best role while a child star at MGM. Not that she was the youngest and most appealing of the kids she was that. But Minnelli did a great job in directing her. She had all the fears and trepidations of a child growing up and not wanting to leave all she's known and loved in St. Louis. Her acting reached its zenith in the scene where she destroys the carefully made snowmen in her yard and in the Halloween scene where she is induced to play a practical joke on a neighbor the rest of the kids regard as scary. Her number with Judy Garland Under The Bamboo Tree is a gem.Meet Me In St. Louis was one of the earliest and best films coming out of the Arthur Freed unit at MGM. It was films like these that gave the Freed unit and MGM its reputation for turning out the best in musical film entertainment. It can never be duplicated because you don't have studios with all that talent under contract.In its way the film itself is as nostalgic as the time it celebrates. I guarantee your heart strings will go Zing Zing Zing as you hear Judy Garland sing the score from Meet Me In St. Louis.".

And to my knowledge no other World's Fair had as enduring a theme song as the one written for this fair serving as the title song for the film.The Smith family consists of parents Leon Ames and Mary Astor and their five children son Henry Daniels Jr. and daughters in descending order Lucille Bremer Judy Garland Joan Carroll and Margaret O'Brien. Grandfather Harry Davenport lives with the clan and so does livein maid Marjorie Main who functions like Alice in the Brady household. A good meal and an occasional wisecrack to keep everyone in line.Everyone's excited about the upcoming fair St. Louis's rival city Chicago had one a decade earlier and Buffalo did three years earlier but this one promises to be the most extravagant of all. Ames gets an opportunity in business and wants to move the family to New York but one by one the family has or develops obligations and ties to St. Louis that makes them reluctant to leave. Not to mention they don't want to miss the fair.Vincente Minnelli directed Meet Me In St. Louis and it was his first opportunity to work with Judy Garland whom he would marry after the film was finished. Judy got to do three of her most identified songs from the Hugh MartinRalph Blane score that was blended with some traditional music of the times. The Boy Next Door Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas and The Trolley Song all come out of Meet Me In St. Louis and were staple items at Garland concerts for years. One of the Oscar nominations that Meet Me In St. Louis received was for The Trolley Song for Best Original Song. It lost to Bing Crosby's Swinging On A Star that year. The other nominations were for musical scoring color cinematography and screenplay.Margaret O'Brien did a remarkable job in this film this was probably her best role while a child star at MGM. Not that she was the youngest and most appealing of the kids she was that. But Minnelli did a great job in directing her. She had all the fears and trepidations of a child growing up and not wanting to leave all she's known and loved in St. Louis. Her acting reached its zenith in the scene where she destroys the carefully made snowmen in her yard and in the Halloween scene where she is induced to play a practical joke on a neighbor the rest of the kids regard as scary. Her number with Judy Garland Under The Bamboo Tree is a gem.Meet Me In St. Louis was one of the earliest and best films coming out of the Arthur Freed unit at MGM. It was films like these that gave the Freed unit and MGM its reputation for turning out the best in musical film entertainment. It can never be duplicated because you don't have studios with all that talent under contract.In its way the film itself is as nostalgic as the time it celebrates. I guarantee your heart strings will go Zing Zing Zing as you hear Judy Garland sing the score from Meet Me In St. Louis.";

	schema:headline " Meet Me in St. Louis is still one of the greatest movie musicals ever made!";
	schema:reviewBody "This was the third time I watched this particular movie and the reason I watched this just now was because it was Christmas and this film had the song Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas sung by Ms. Judy Garland to Margaret O'Brien. Because I knew this film was made in 1944 part of me wondered when that song was written with those lyrics much different than the revised ones written for 1957 when Frank Sinatra sang it and others after him would follow suit during that time whether it was meant to address the audience of that period of their worries of their loved ones being overseas during the holidays and their concern of them ever coming back to them in the future. Anyway this is such an entertaining musical with such great comedy and drama from not only Ms. Garland and O'Brien but also Harry Davenport as the grandpa and Marjorie Main as the maid. The best sequence involves Ms. O'Brien going out alone on Halloween involving a prank that was common during the 1903 period. Oh and Ms. Garland also did great numbers like The Boy Next Door and The Trolley Song. Oh and no wonder she married director Vincente Minnelli after making this as she gets some of her best closeups here! So on that note that's a high recommendation of Meet Me in St. Louis. P.S. Great intro on the DVD from Judy and Vincente's daughter Liza Minnelli.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's sentimental favorite time here on Hot Toasty Rag. I'm sure everyone has their own favorite Judy Garland impersonator but at my house there's no comparison to my mom. And while she has been known to wave her hands in the air during The Man That Got Away or I Could Go On Singing it's The Trolley Song from Meet Me in St. Louis that is her signature Judy Garland performance. Years before watching the movie for the first time I knew the Clang Clang Clang song by heart because of my mom. Therefore my review for Meet Me in St. Louis is going to be unapologetically biased. Ironically she doesn't even really like the movie! I'm the one who insists on keeping our VHS copy.Judy Garland Lucille Bremer and Margaret O'Brien are sisters in an allAmerican family in the early 1900s. Judy and Lucille have romantic problems to worry about and Margaret doesn't always play nice with the other neighborhood kids. Add in Marjorie Main the family's grumpy maid two other children a fatherinlaw and a new invention called the telephone and both parents Leon Ames and Mary Astor have their hands full! The film is chockfull of songs with oldfashioned standards like the title song and Under the Bamboo Tree as well as new songs for the film including Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. While the movie is upbeat and fun it's also a little sad Judy sings the Christmas song to a sobbing Margaret who has just destroyed her own snowman. I always feel sorry for Leon Ames's character in the film. Not only is he overrun by females in the house but he's constantly put down stifled criticized and left out of important family discussions. At that time the turn of the 20th century men were believed to rule their own roosts but maybe they didn't. Meet Me in St. Louis is such a heartwarming piece of Americana maybe it was realistic for the father figure to have less of a say in his house than the overwhelming majority. In any case my heart still goes out to Leon a character actor who was normally overlooked.I love this one despite the sadness because there were so many famous moments I was taught as a kid and looked forward to seeing for the first time onscreen after years of buildup. This might not wind up be your favorite Judy Garland movie but you can rent it and see if you like it.".

	schema:headline " There's no place like home...";
	schema:reviewBody "I suspect I didn't give Meet Me in St. Louis the attention it fully deserved.Sometimes the words Technicolor musical Golden Age don't necessarily hit a sensitive chord and I blame it on the Millennial side of me too blas and hungry of modern significance. I could watch The Wizard of Oz for its status as an iconic classic A Star is Born for its relevance and place in Judy Garland's filmography. But Vincente Minnelli's ode to Saint Louis never caught my attention despite its more than respectable reputation. And now that I saw it and that I digested it I realize how misinformed I was and I suspect this is a film I might want to watch again.This is one of these pitchproof movie where you keep waiting for something to happen... yet you realize that's not even the point. Indeed who needs plot when you have the Smithes? This is a family full of such colorful characters that there's no room whatsoever for any plot or prewritten arc. Why should it anyway? Adapted from the happy memories of Sally Tootie Benson yes told from the little one's standpoint the film displays such an exhilarating form of happiness that spoiling it with a plot would be a cinematic sin.So let's visit the family! Leon Ames is Mr. Smith father of one son and four daughters including Rose Lucille Bremer the second oldest Esther Judy Garland and the youngest one Tootie Margaret O'Brien Mrs. Smith Mary Astor endure their shenanigans valiantly while they can count on the support of their cool and hilarious grandpa Henry Davenport. These are the Smiths and as soon as they appear on the screen we're literally caught in their communicative amiability and optimism with the opening theme of the same title.Meet Me in Saint Louis belongs to these vignette familythemed movies such as Amarcord or Radio Days where it's just about getting a mood and feeling part of a loving community rather than watching something happening. And just when you think something ought to happen false alarm a new song pops up again to lift your spirit up and puts you in the most cheerful mood even the straight sister Rose is fun to watch especially during her shining moment where she gets quite a brush from her correspondent. And everything's in good spirit no character is laughed at but rather laughed with.The closest to a plot comes when Mr. Smith announces to the family that they're going to move to New York and the decision is irrevocable by the time it happens we got used to the seasonal enchantment of the city and can't imagine the Smiths anywhere outside St. Louis. Even New York resonates like a place of doom for the family but it's deliberate since the film is a postcard recollection of middleupper class family from the perspective of Tootie only spiced up with adult and romantic subplot and unforgettable musical numbers that were the perfect vehicles for Judy Garland.If Meet Me in Saint Louis is incredibly catchy it's nothing compared to the Trolley Song and of course the Have Yourself a merry Little Christmas that became Hollywood standards and among Garland's signatures. The two songs listed in the AFI's Top 100 convey two opposite emotions joy and sheer sadness the excitement of being part of a city and the resignation before living the Christmas moment is particularly heartbreaking as it allows Margaret O'Brien to implode her full acting power and make thousands of souls cry with empathetic tears. That the comic relief of the film that bratty little kid could pull off such a masterful performance is one of the unexpected effects of the film. She would deservedly win an Academy Juvenile Award for her incredible performance.I can go over and over about the film its merit is to be so blatantly cheerful never indulging to cheap thrills even the love stories are sweetly nave and idealistic almost surreal but fitting for a fantasy picture whose purpose is to highlight the real thing about th film family ties and the bonds between sisters or parents and grandparents the film is a nonstop delight that can be regarded as itsch or campy but I find it more straightforward and honest than Minnelli' An American in Paris. In a way it's a fine companion piece to Judy Garland's Wizard of Oz with the same conclusion that there's no place like home... and sometimes we don't cherish enough the place we live in.My only complaint is Garland's awful hairstyle was she trying to imitate Katharine Hepburn or what?".

	onyx:emotionText "I suspect I didn't give Meet Me in St. Louis the attention it fully deserved.Sometimes the words Technicolor musical Golden Age don't necessarily hit a sensitive chord and I blame it on the Millennial side of me too blas and hungry of modern significance. I could watch The Wizard of Oz for its status as an iconic classic A Star is Born for its relevance and place in Judy Garland's filmography. But Vincente Minnelli's ode to Saint Louis never caught my attention despite its more than respectable reputation. And now that I saw it and that I digested it I realize how misinformed I was and I suspect this is a film I might want to watch again.This is one of these pitchproof movie where you keep waiting for something to happen... yet you realize that's not even the point. Indeed who needs plot when you have the Smithes? This is a family full of such colorful characters that there's no room whatsoever for any plot or prewritten arc. Why should it anyway? Adapted from the happy memories of Sally Tootie Benson yes told from the little one's standpoint the film displays such an exhilarating form of happiness that spoiling it with a plot would be a cinematic sin.So let's visit the family! Leon Ames is Mr. Smith father of one son and four daughters including Rose Lucille Bremer the second oldest Esther Judy Garland and the youngest one Tootie Margaret O'Brien Mrs. Smith Mary Astor endure their shenanigans valiantly while they can count on the support of their cool and hilarious grandpa Henry Davenport. These are the Smiths and as soon as they appear on the screen we're literally caught in their communicative amiability and optimism with the opening theme of the same title.Meet Me in Saint Louis belongs to these vignette familythemed movies such as Amarcord or Radio Days where it's just about getting a mood and feeling part of a loving community rather than watching something happening. And just when you think something ought to happen false alarm a new song pops up again to lift your spirit up and puts you in the most cheerful mood even the straight sister Rose is fun to watch especially during her shining moment where she gets quite a brush from her correspondent. And everything's in good spirit no character is laughed at but rather laughed with.The closest to a plot comes when Mr. Smith announces to the family that they're going to move to New York and the decision is irrevocable by the time it happens we got used to the seasonal enchantment of the city and can't imagine the Smiths anywhere outside St. Louis. Even New York resonates like a place of doom for the family but it's deliberate since the film is a postcard recollection of middleupper class family from the perspective of Tootie only spiced up with adult and romantic subplot and unforgettable musical numbers that were the perfect vehicles for Judy Garland.If Meet Me in Saint Louis is incredibly catchy it's nothing compared to the Trolley Song and of course the Have Yourself a merry Little Christmas that became Hollywood standards and among Garland's signatures. The two songs listed in the AFI's Top 100 convey two opposite emotions joy and sheer sadness the excitement of being part of a city and the resignation before living the Christmas moment is particularly heartbreaking as it allows Margaret O'Brien to implode her full acting power and make thousands of souls cry with empathetic tears. That the comic relief of the film that bratty little kid could pull off such a masterful performance is one of the unexpected effects of the film. She would deservedly win an Academy Juvenile Award for her incredible performance.I can go over and over about the film its merit is to be so blatantly cheerful never indulging to cheap thrills even the love stories are sweetly nave and idealistic almost surreal but fitting for a fantasy picture whose purpose is to highlight the real thing about th film family ties and the bonds between sisters or parents and grandparents the film is a nonstop delight that can be regarded as itsch or campy but I find it more straightforward and honest than Minnelli' An American in Paris. In a way it's a fine companion piece to Judy Garland's Wizard of Oz with the same conclusion that there's no place like home... and sometimes we don't cherish enough the place we live in.My only complaint is Garland's awful hairstyle was she trying to imitate Katharine Hepburn or what?";

I must say though that most reviews I've read I've almost never seen anyone badmouth Judy just on a couple reviews for this film. Other bad reviews I've read people are usually picking at other things about Judy's films but are still saying they love Judy and her singing and they still think she's pretty.

I love old fashioned classics such as this film and Judy's other films. The wonderful songs in this film are the trolley song  the boy next door have yourself a merry little Christmas and the title song.

I don't find anything groundbreaking about this movie because of the amount of praise it gets. Don't get me wrong I like the movie but I don't think its a masterpiece or anything like that. For what it is I think its fine and it is indeed watchable. The cast in this movie are good especially for Judy Garland although I like her more when she was in The Wizard of Oz. I do love the film's cinematography and its setting. I really do enjoy the atmosphere of St. Louis as you go on out and have a wonderful time. The movie is also well directed and well written. The movie itself is not really a Christmas movie but at the end it does somehow leave you that Christmas feeling as Garland sings wonderfully with the song Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas the songs in the film are fine too. Again there is nothing groundbreaking about it but I do think it is a fine relaxation of a movie as you just want to enjoy the atmosphere of St. Louis.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a nearly flawless musical film by Vincent Minelli based on a series of writings by Sally Benson about her real life family from St. Louis Missouri at the turn of the 20th Century. Although the most famous sequence and a real heartbreaker at one point deals with the current Christmas season the film really looks at the events in the Smith family from Spring 1903 to Spring 1904 culminating in their attending the above mentioned Louisiana Puchase Exposition that was under construction at the time. It was one of many Worlds Fairs that were frequently occurring in the 19th Century the most notable previous ones in the U.S. being the 1876 Philadelphia Worlds Fair the movie CENTENNIAL SUMMER is about that one the 1893 Chicago World's Fair subject of a few movies and the 1901 Pan American Exposition at Buffalo New York which is involved in the plot of the film THIS IS MY AFFAIR because President William McKinley was assassinated there.The Louisiana Purchase Exposition was best remembered for the invention by accident of the hot dog and the ice cream cone the latter when a vendor ran out of paper mittens for holding the frankfurters and sausages and bought some roles the latter when a vendor ran out of paper plates for ice cream and used some soft waffles as cones. But in it's day it was an exciting place and it was a very successful world's fair.The Smith family is made up of the father Leon Ames the mother Mary Astor the grandfather Harry Davenport the son Henry Daniel Jr. and the four daughters Lucille Bremer Judy Garland Joan Caroll and Margaret O'Brien and their cook Marjorie Main. Bremer has a boyfriend studying at Princeton Robert Sully and Garland is fascinated by the next door neighbor Tom Drake. In the course of the year we watch the family enjoying their close friendships with other St. Louis residence even little Tootie  Margaret O'Brien  likes to ride and help the iceman Mr. Neeley Chill Wills. We see them having social parties with singing Minelli includes many songs in the film but he does maintain period music  one hears Ethelbert Nevin's Narcissa White and the popular tune Under the Bamboo Tree that is sung and danced by Garland and O'Brien. Even some of the songs for the film are set in that period most notably The Trolley Song.The trouble in the story is the decision by Ames to move to New York and begin a New York City office of his large St. Louis law firm. This shakes up the family who are used to living in St.Louis and think of New York in the warning words of Marjorie Main as a place where people live in tenements! While this film has great sweet comic moments O'Brien in Halloween disguise playing pranks on neighbors with flour and fake bodies it also has one truly gut wrenching moment. If any film belongs to two players despite ensemble excellence it is MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS. Garland's songs THE TROLLEY SONG THE BOY NEXT DOOR HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE Christmas all are wonderful and became part of her legendary repertoire. But O'Brien stole the heart of the audience as Tootie not just by her funny antics she looks so cute and little in this film but in her dramatic scene  when she breaks down at the thought of leaving St. Louis and destroys her snowmen family so nobody else can have them when they move. The sequence always brings tears to my eyes as it is perfectly done.This comment does not ignore the other players. Ames turns in a gilt edge performance as a father who learns a valuable lesson in what is important to his family above larger salaries. Astor is properly loyal to her mate even if she disagrees with his initial decision. Davenport spices the film particularly at the Christmas dance scene where he rescues Garland and Main has her normal salty comments about the activities around her. It is one of the greatest of MGM musicals and a wonderful look at the lost world of Teddy Roosevelt's America.".

We see them having social parties with singing Minelli includes many songs in the film but he does maintain period music  one hears Ethelbert Nevin's Narcissa White and the popular tune Under the Bamboo Tree that is sung and danced by Garland and O'Brien. Even some of the songs for the film are set in that period most notably The Trolley Song.The trouble in the story is the decision by Ames to move to New York and begin a New York City office of his large St. Louis law firm. This shakes up the family who are used to living in St.Louis and think of New York in the warning words of Marjorie Main as a place where people live in tenements! While this film has great sweet comic moments O'Brien in Halloween disguise playing pranks on neighbors with flour and fake bodies it also has one truly gut wrenching moment. If any film belongs to two players despite ensemble excellence it is MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS. Garland's songs THE TROLLEY SONG THE BOY NEXT DOOR HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE Christmas all are wonderful and became part of her legendary repertoire. But O'Brien stole the heart of the audience as Tootie not just by her funny antics she looks so cute and little in this film but in her dramatic scene  when she breaks down at the thought of leaving St. Louis and destroys her snowmen family so nobody else can have them when they move. The sequence always brings tears to my eyes as it is perfectly done.This comment does not ignore the other players. Ames turns in a gilt edge performance as a father who learns a valuable lesson in what is important to his family above larger salaries. Astor is properly loyal to her mate even if she disagrees with his initial decision. Davenport spices the film particularly at the Christmas dance scene where he rescues Garland and Main has her normal salty comments about the activities around her. It is one of the greatest of MGM musicals and a wonderful look at the lost world of Teddy Roosevelt's America.";

	schema:headline " An early modern musical still worth watching barely";
	schema:reviewBody "None of the songs in this film bears any relation to the story line but few people notice because there is no story line no plot. Nothing beyond Will the family go to the fair? So why watch such a boring movie? Nostalgia. Set in 19034 made in 1944 Meet Me in St. Louis is the equivalent of looking back at 1971 today at least mathematically. 1904 must have seemed so long ago even in 1944 and in the depths of World War II surely the peaceful normalcy must have had great appeal with audiences. What makes St. Louis of some interest today is that it is a very early example of a fullblown modern movie musical and of Technicolor. There were musicals in the Thirties but much of the music was staged performed by performers. Gradually beginning perhaps with The Wizard of Oz studios shifted over to free form musicals where singing and dancing arose spontaneously from ordinary people. Garland played a key role in the evolution of these musicals because of her top notch musical interpretations. To get a feel for the development of the modern musical you need to see Meet Me in St. Louis and see other movies around this time period to get perspective. Another key musical was State Fair in 1945 the first Rodgers  Hammerstein musical on the screen. State Fair copied the device of the opening song about the fair passed around among the characters but otherwise was distinct. Some say St. Louis was inspired by the theme of the earlier nonmusical State Fair in 1933. When you compare the two the music in State Fair is far more closely integrated to the story line and is an expression of the thoughts of the characters  the Rodgers  Hammerstein hallmark. There is some free form singing but much of it is tied to musical performances so it is still mostly old form. On the other hand The Trolley Song is great fun but the words are glaringly inconsistent with what you see on the screen. State Fair has a stronger story line and a more elaborate expressive dance number choreographed by Hermes Pan during the Iowa song. There is more humor and more pathos. But it is essentially a light escapist story like Meet Me in St. Louis. When I look at the two State Fair 1945 makes me heartsick for the normalcy and decency of an America we seem to be losing while St. Louis produces no such emotion perhaps because it is so long ago but mostly because it looks so artificial. St. Louis has Garland the charming Margaret O'Brien demonstrating her remarkable ability to cry on cue and Marjorie Main performing some delightful scenes. Some people love this movie and these are probably why. And some people just go gaga over the theatricality of musicals the color dancing music even when there is little or no plot to hold it together. The movie opens with the main characters singing the title song. Gee I wonder what's going to happen? The suspense is killing me! What follows is a grab bags of scenes from family life circa 190304 some cute some quaint but mostly clich and some nice songs we used to sing at summer camp. Let's face it Meet Me in St. Louis is famous for its songs especially the Trolley Song. Take out the music and what have you? A movie without a plot a slice of life story. Garland is at her best singing Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. But listen to the words closely it is not Garland in 1903 it is Garland talking about WWIINext year all our troubles will be miles awaySomeday soon we all will be togetherIf the Fates allowWhat does this have to do with the movie? The song was first published in 1943.Without the music I would rate this movie a 3 out of 10 with it a 5. It is highly overrated. State Fair 1945 is almost forgotten yet has a lot of polish and fine detail and a story line of eternal appeal in short a classic so it is highly underrated. Part of the contemporary 10 star hype surrounding St. Louis may be because it is a clean family movie that mostly fits the bill of Christian fundamentalists though there is a shocking premarital kiss or two. On the other hand I feel sorry for those who are so jaded they give it 2 stars. It's still fun in a brainless sort of way. By all means see Meet Me in St. Louis. It has an important place in the history of cinema. You will probably enjoy it and hear some fine singing by Judy Garland. If you like this type of story you should watch the 1949 Little Women which stars a slightly older Margaret O'Brien. Or Life with Father 1947. Or I Remember Mama 1948. Or even Cheaper by the Dozen. They are all semiautobiographical stories of family life far more interesting and better acted. A fictional family slice of life movie with O'Brien is Our Vines Have Tender Grapes also starring Edward G. Robinson and Agnes Moorehead. It is a clean family values film that anyone can enjoy.And for a musical on a similar family theme see the 1945 State Fair not to be confused with the 1963 remake. The Technicolor work is actual much more impressive though the sound quality is not as good. It is a vastly superior film than St. Louis which will warm your heart.Spoiler alertIn the last two minutes the family finally arrives at the fair. They spend the first minute talking about where to eat and the second exclaiming how beautiful it is. The end.".

This is a really enjoyable light and simple pleasant early French musical. Though the best moments are the silent moments that does not mean that the movie is not filled with some great humorous dialog that gets very well delivered by the main actors who all seemed like stage actors to me which in this case worked extremely well for the movie its overall style and pleasant noworries atmosphere. No wonder this worked out so well since this movie is actually based on stage play by Georges Berr.It's a technical really great movie with also some great innovation camerawork in it and some really great editing that create some fast going and pleasant to watch enjoyable sequences. There is never a dull moment in this movie!Ren Clair was such a clever director who knew how to build up and plan comical moments within in movies. It's a very creative made movie that despite its simplicity still at all times feel as a totally original and cleverly constructed movie that never seizes to entertain.The last half hour is especially unforgettably fun without spoiling too much and is really among the greatest as well as most creative moments in early comedy filmmaking.The movie is filled with some really enjoyable characters who are of course all very stereotypical and silly and were obviously cast because of their looks.

	schema:reviewBody "I have lately got into the habit of purchasing any interesting DVD that the Criterion company releases. I figure that even if I dislike the movie Criterion usually supplies enough extra material to compensate for any shortcomings in the actual film. I read up on them and I buy the ones which are the most interesting to me.Le Million is my latest purchase and I must say that I was not disappointed in the film. It is cheery funny and romantic. Everything about it is quite excellent. The songs are wonderful. If I understood French I would probably hum them and sing them all day long. The acting is very good for this kind of movie. American musicals of the classic Hollywood era relied more on song and dance than the actual characters and story but in Le Million the characters are rather well developed and the story while not being anything extremely impressive is not at all lacking. I loved the developments of the relationships especially the relationship between the once best friends Michel and Prosper. The romantic moments are also very well developed. The direction is nearly perfect with several very memorable moments. Probably the single most perfect scene of the film occurs right after the lead couple has an argument. They hide on the stage of an opera performance and the opera singers sing lines which the couple Michel and Beatrice interpret to their own situation. This is definitely one of the high points in cinema history. The scene managed to make me laugh to win me over with a very sweet romance and make me smirk at just how clever the director was. I give this film a 910.P.S.  Some information for anyone who has the same faith in Criterion that I do and is planning to buy it. Amongst the Criterion discs I now own Le Million contains the fewest features. All it has is a photo gallery not all that useful one might flip through it once and a rare television interview with Rene Clair the director. This piece is of some interest. He was one of the many directors who had started out in silent film and when talkies were first appearing he said that they represented the death of film. I think most filmsavvy people understand what these directors meant when they said that but it is interesting to hear him explain it. Also if you have read the description of this movie on Amazon.com please note that they were wrong in one important respect not every line in the film is sung. In fact it contains no more songs than a regular musical. It is actually a lot more like a Chaplin or Buster Keaton or Marx Brothers film. My criticisms of the disc are not that important. Heck Criterion has the right to smack me around for making those complaints. The fact is their people probably spent hundreds of hours fixing up a film which only 20 now 21! people have voted for on imdb and only about a hundred people if that will ever see the film. Heck if you look at the Criterion web site Le Million is nowhere to be found. I have no clue why not. It's something they should really be proud of of course their web site is surprisingly horrible. They did a fine job on this film. Bravo! They deserve all the money I can stand to give them!".

	schema:reviewBody "Rene Clair's groundbreaking musical. If you want to see where songs first drove a story this is the place. This is the story of a starving young artist who finds he's won the lottery just as his creditors come calling. Unfortunately his ticket is in his coat which is in his girlfriends apartment and has been given to an on the run convict who then... oh but that would be telling.This is a light and frothy story where much of the dialog is sung most people think this didn't happen until Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber. Its the sort of movie that they don't make any more and rarely did when they did. Its sound a film from the early days that plays like a movie from five or six years later. Clair moves his camera around in ways that not even Busby Berkeley was doing though to be honest comparing the two film makers is unfair since Berkeley was doing essentially stage bound dance numbers and Clair was moving the camera through the real world. Its an amazing little movie. and its a charming movie that will just make you smile. Its just a fluffy piece of enjoyment.I'm sorry I can't say more. Its just a nice little movie and thats really all you need to know.".

	onyx:emotionText "Rene Clair's groundbreaking musical. If you want to see where songs first drove a story this is the place. This is the story of a starving young artist who finds he's won the lottery just as his creditors come calling. Unfortunately his ticket is in his coat which is in his girlfriends apartment and has been given to an on the run convict who then... oh but that would be telling.This is a light and frothy story where much of the dialog is sung most people think this didn't happen until Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber. Its the sort of movie that they don't make any more and rarely did when they did. Its sound a film from the early days that plays like a movie from five or six years later. Clair moves his camera around in ways that not even Busby Berkeley was doing though to be honest comparing the two film makers is unfair since Berkeley was doing essentially stage bound dance numbers and Clair was moving the camera through the real world. Its an amazing little movie. and its a charming movie that will just make you smile. Its just a fluffy piece of enjoyment.I'm sorry I can't say more. Its just a nice little movie and thats really all you need to know.";

	schema:headline " Delightful Rene Clair musical";
	schema:reviewBody "Le Million is a 1931 musical directed by Rene Clair. It's wonderful that it's available on DVD for audiences to see and enjoy it. The story concerns a starving Parisian artist Michele Rene Lefevre who is having a bad day. He is being hounded by every creditor in town and as his fianc Beatrice Annabella walks into his apartment he is embracing his model. Then he realizes that he has won the Dutch lottery with his friend Prosper JeanLouis Allibert but the ticket is in his coat pocket and the coat is gone. The citywide hunt then begins for the coat which was taken by Beatrice and given to a needy person who sold it to the opera singer Sopranelli. There is a hilarious scene in Sopranelli's dressing room as various people try to get the ticket out of the coat pocket. Beatrice and Michele wind up behind some scenery on the opera stage and relate to the duet that's being sung.This film and Clair obviously influenced such talents as the Marx Brothers Ernst Lubitsch and Rouben Mamoulian. All the performances are good with the beautiful Annabella a brunette here a standout as the ballerina Beatrice. Annabella was signed by 20th Century Fox and brought over to America around 1938 made Suez with Tyrone Power and the two fell in love and decided to get married. In order to dissuade her and his biggest star from marrying Zanuck offered her several films in Europe but she refused to leave her fiance. Zanuck made sure she didn't work much after that effectively blacklisting her. She had a big Broadway success worked on behalf of the troops during World War II and returned to France after her divorce from Power. She retired in 1954. Her radio work with Power and this film show what a wonderful actress she was.Very good film  highly recommended.".

And that is what Clair does here  beginning with some entertaining misadventures that introduce the characters he then sets up the main story about the lottery ticket and from there on it builds up nicely both in humor and in complexity. The climactic sequence in the opera house is a wellcrafted extended slapstick sequence that also includes some interesting parallels.The cast works well with Annabella particularly standing out with her engaging performance as Batrice.The style is an interesting contrast from what eventually became the norm in movie musicals. The musical sequences which vary considerably in length are for the most part worked naturally into the flow of events rather than being set off as separate numbers. Clair and the cast make this format work well. The overall result is a very enjoyable movie that you will also remember for its imaginative approach.".

They sing and dance as the shot dissolves to a couple alone in the room kissing. It's an astonishing opening sequence. And so Rene Clair begins to weave his magical charming funny story. I like to bore people by telling them that I can tell if I'm going to like a movie within the first five minutes. Le Million took me all of five seconds. It is nothing more or less than a farce a romp with people of all shapes and sizes all with varying motives tearing through hallways and popping in and out of doorways with dizzying regularity. Two coinciding chases collide. A serious opera morphs into a game of touch football. And every so often  quite often in fact  people just start singing! There's a lovely operetta duet onstage that frames the real thing going on behind the scenes. And best of all with all the fun poked at various characters and all the little satirical jabs there isn't a meanspirited moment in the entire film. How rare is that? I wonder if Blake Edwards thought of this film when he was writing the script for VictorVictoria. And yes Virginia there is a fat lady  and she sings!".

Great direction by Rene Clair. It's easy to see the Chaplin andor Clair influences including chase sequences fight sequences opera spoofs. An early soundsilent blend that is masterfully done. Unique and entertaining with great performances. This movie contains all the elements of comedy music farce and timing. A must see you will not be disappointed! Charming and thoroughly enjoyable. Excellent restoration print. Easy to read subtitles that match the musical text.".

	schema:reviewBody "Le million 1931  12 out of 4 Extremely charming and inventive French comedy takes a simple idea and really expands it to something special. A starving artist name Michel Rene Lefevre is being hounded by collectors when he realizes that he's won the lottery. He rushes to get his coat where the ticket is but learns his girlfriend Annabella has given it away which leads to a wild chase in hopes of getting it back. I wasn't sure what to expect when entering this film because I had heard that it contained some pretty strange things but within minutes I was caught up in the story and the way it was being played out. I don't think the movie is laugh out loud funny but it doesn't really need to be. In fact I think the story could have gone for more slapstick and gotten bigger laughs but in a strange way it's smarter than that and goes for something completely different. Having the actors sing their dialogue makes this film come off very fresh today and I can't imagine and fresh and unique it must have been in 1931 when many sound films didn't sound all that great. The delivery of the music is topnotch and many of the songs are better than what Americans were hearing in their musicals then. Another major plus are the performances which are all very charming but Lefevre really carries the thing as he floats around like a feather and really hits all the right moves. The one thing that didn't work too well for me was the rather long sequence at the opera. I thought some of it went on a tad bit too long although the football scene here was greatly directed.".

An impoverished artist dunned on all sides by creditors learns from the newspaper that he holds a winning lottery ticket. In theory. The ticket is in his jacket pocket his fianc has given the jacket to a passing stranger in turn he has ... and in 1931 that was the basis for an engaging comedy with music rather than a more conventional musical comedy.

It had some other features too one of them was the beautiful geometric pattern of roofs in the panoramic scan in the beginning and also interesting geometric patterns of the apartment during Tulip Chase also in the early parts these were pure piece of art.

	schema:reviewBody "Rene Clair has a style best characterized by Vernon Young as champagne on cornflakes.  Le Million is ostensibly a kind of Preston Sturges plot  a man wins the lottery but can't find the ticket.  Musical numbers and ebullient camerawork and cutting make this a standout for early sound films although Clair's own A nous la liberte was better.  And the wonderful fuzz that has collected on early 30's films is still eminently there.  What all these restorations fail to point out to the uninformed viewer is the physical hazards that a film had to endure for fifty or sixty years before a restorer got enough financing to recreate a film like Le Million.  Perfect of its kind yet ultimately cornflakes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found out about this French film because it was in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die it sounded like it could be good from the description so I looked forward to it directed by Ren Clair  Nous la Libert. Basically in Paris Michel Bouflette Ren Lefvre is a debtridden artist with various debts from hounding creditors. To make matters worse he has upset his fiance Batrice Annabella after she witnessed him embracing a woman whose portrait he was painting. Michel discovers that his luck may be about to change when he discovers that he has won a lottery worth a million Dutch florins. However his winning ticket is in the pocket of his jacket which Batrice has given away to a stranger supposedly in need. When news of this spreads everyone becomes interested in finding this jacket including a criminal nicknamed Grandpa Tulip Crochard Paul Ollivier. Michel tracks down the jacket to an opera theatre where a tenor is performing Les Bohmiens. After a short stint in jail Michel makes it to the theatre but ends up in a madcap chase with Batrice as they try to regain the ticket. The jacket ends up flying out of a window onto the roof of a taxi Michel chases after it in another taxi. The chase eventually stops but when Michel retrieves the jacket his search for the ticket is thwarted by associates of Grandpa Tulip who force him to hand it over. Feeling dejected he returns to his apartment to find his creditors in good spirits as they think that they will be repaid. Before Michel is about to tell them the bad news Tulip enters the apartment with a jacket. Thinking that this is his original jacket Michel searches the pockets. Finding them empty he tells Tulip that he actually wanted a ticket in the pocket which Tulip subsequently produces having taken it out of the jacket before giving it away. He is overjoyed to have it back again as is Batrice and many people who enter and they all celebrate Michel's newfound fortune. Also starring JeanLouis Allibert as Prosper and Constantin Siroesco as Ambrosio Sopranelli. It is a fairly simple story of chase across Paris to get back a winning jackpot ticket it has some amusing moments stylish camerawork and cinematography and catchy music and tunes it is a charming enough musical comedy. Good!".

	schema:reviewBody "Saw 'Le Million' for four main reasons. Firstly the premise was really appetising. Silly but it sounded very charming. Secondly have always appreciated highly classic film dating way back from as early as 6 or 7 seeing the likes of 'The Wizard of Oz' for the first time. Thirdly early talkies were a very mixed bag with some of them being less than great but enough of them were good and interesting.Lastly have liked what has been seen of Rene Clair's in his second sound film work ever since seeing 'And Then There Were None' for the first time. 'Le Million' for me was a wonderful film and a refreshing one that was much needed during a terrible time one of the best seen in a while of all my first time viewings and that is saying something. It is proof that not all early talkies were stiff stagebound talky or creaky. Along with 1929's 'Applause' and 1931's 'Marius' the first part of the wonderful Marseille Trilogy it is among the best and really stands out for its creativity only seen before as far as early talkies go in 'Applause'.What is immediately striking is the fluidity and sophistication of the cinematography. None of the static or stilted quality seen in some early talkies when first transitioning from silent to sound instead it is the most creative and sophisticated early talkie visually since 'Applause' just as innovative and it is techniquewise more refined than that film. Really liked the sets too sure they were studio sets but strikingly designed ones. The music is absolutely delightful and very cleverly used not only is it consistently harmonious with what's going on it is lovely very infectious and evokes a lot of emotions in its own way.The way the sound is used in 'Le Million' also makes it stand out. Sound technology was still in relative infancy but is used to remarkably professional effect that didn't come as clumsy experimenting but instead coming over like the technique was near perfected. It is also as innovatively done as 'Applause' which was also revolutionary in its use of sound technology but perhaps more refined. The script is both funny and charming tightened enough to not make it be too rambling.Although the story may be silly it is delightfully so in an endearing way is very clever and never felt forced to me. Never does it feel dull either. The characters are easy to engage with and are interesting. Clair's direction is immaculate and he is one of the few very early sound film directors to seem comfortable in the transition from silent to sound in the finished product a big example of directors being unsuccessful in being comfortable with it is DW Griffith it may not have been the case off camera but it doesn't show on it.Can't fault the performances either with lovely Annabella carrying the film with style and graceful charm. Absolutely loved the climax too one of the funniest and most imaginative endings for any film seen recently.In summary wonderful. 1010".
