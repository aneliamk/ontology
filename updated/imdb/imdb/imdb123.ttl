Claude Rains is unable to harness his innate Britishness in his portrayal of the DA maybe the film's single biggest drawback. But the other actors with or without the appropriate Dixie cadences are superb notably Allyn Joslyn in his movie debut as an amoral opportunistic reporter. I'm particularly fond of Gloria Dickson's heartfelt performance as the accused man's wife and sad to read that she died so young. This is an excellent film of its type the Warner Brothers 'message picture'. It is not aesthetically pleasing in its detail or dialogue but this was not the point. It gets the job done stimulates the intellect and the emotions and moves like lightning.".

With racial and religious overtones and a terrific performance by Claude Rains as a politically motivated prosecutor. The courtroom scenes are some of the best ever seen on film with excellent editing and drama that reaches a feverish momentum. Knowing the fate that awaits the accused adds even more gravity to the film. Similar to LeRoy's earlier film I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang both slam southern justice and have unforgettable endings.".

	onyx:emotionText "A stunning courtroom drama set in a small southern town about a northerner working as an instructor at a small local business college accused of the murder of a local girl who was one of his students. With racial and religious overtones and a terrific performance by Claude Rains as a politically motivated prosecutor. The courtroom scenes are some of the best ever seen on film with excellent editing and drama that reaches a feverish momentum. Knowing the fate that awaits the accused adds even more gravity to the film. Similar to LeRoy's earlier film I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang both slam southern justice and have unforgettable endings.";

It all takes place in a Southern town. A man is accused of a murder he did not commit. The prosecutor soon realizes the man didn't do it but he's the perfect scapegoat a Yankee who only recently moved to the South AND he thinks he can milk this into a successful bid for the Senate! So this cynical clod so well played by Claude Rains does nothing to help exonerate the man and encourages the mob mentality that is growing in the town.What I particularly liked about the film is that it never ran from the course it had taken and copped out for a Hollywood ending. No what occurs seems real and ugly and the film is full of ugly people not sanitized ones. A gritty and compelling drama that is a mustsee for serious fans of Hollywood's Golden Age.For a similar film that is also worth seeing try watching FURY 1936 with Spencer Tracy. For a similar film that is godawful try watching MOUNTAIN JUSTICE 1937don't say I didn't warn you about this one!".

Suspicion quickly falls on her Northern teacher at business school Robert Hale Edward Norris whom she had a crush on. Ambitious district attorney Andy Griffin Claude Rains uses this as an opportunity to build a name for himself not caring about Hale's guilt or innocence. Hale is arrested and tried but the antiNorthern sentiment running through the town guarantees his trial won't be fair.Great role for Claude Rains who owns every scene he's in as a remorseless politician out to further his career regardless of cost. Edward Norris Ann Sheridan's first husband has probably his biggest role as Robert Hale and does a fine job. Film debut of Allyn Joslyn who plays a slimy reporter colluding with Rains. Pretty Gloria Dickson plays Hale's wife. She has a potent speech at the end. First significant role for Lana Turner. Note the tight sweater which accentuates her...attributes. This is why she was dubbed the sweater girl early in her career. The rest of the cast is made up of familiar faces including Otto Kruger and Elisha Cook Jr. Loosely based on the real story of Leo Frank a Jewish man accused of murdering 13 yearold Mary Phagan in Georgia. He was lynched in 1915. The story here keeps antisemitism out of it instead making it more of a focus on the resentments and prejudices of the South towards the North. Having grown up in the South I know these sentiments were very real for many even decades after this movie was made. This is a film that examines everything from bigotry to mob mentality and the manipulation of the public by politicians and the media. Sociologically and historically relevant it's a powerful movie from Warner Bros. with a good cast.".

Together with the wily District Attorney Claude Rains there's an uncommon authority to this searing drama of justice gone wrong. There's also an uncommon richness of detail. The script for all its sprawl remains tight and unrelenting a genuine testament to writers Rossen and Kandel. Then too producer Le Roy pulled out all the stops and the results show it. No one acts without apparent reason. Everyone has understandable motivations for doing what they do. That's why the upshot is so tragic. It's as though there's an onrushing train nobody can stop because the momentum is carried by an infernal logic greater than the demands of justice. Despite appearances it's not an antilynching film though it is that. Rather it's a down and dirty look at the cynical roots of injustice. From lowly pool hall to lofty city council no one wants to convict an innocent man but then no one much cares either. This movie stands as a fine example of why Warner Bros. was the studio of record during the stressedout 1930's. Anyway for guys who don't like the gloomy theme there's always the chance to catch Lana Turner as she juggles two balloons while sashaying up the sidewalk in the film's most famous scene. All in all a classic of 30's social realism with Hollywood at its unapologetic best.".

The local D.A. Claude Rains wanting to rise in the political game charges the teacher with the murder not because of evidence but because the Southerners think he's guilty due to being from the North. I've been wanting to see this film for many years now after hearing so much about it and it certainly didn't let me down. I think the courtroom drama is probably my favorite genre and this here ranks with the very best out there. What really stands out are the performances which are all excellent. Norris doesn't stand out in the crowd but he delivers a very somber performance. The real standout is Gloria Dickson as his wife. The final speech she gives is quite chilling and very memorable. Rains also gives a great performance although I think he goes a bit over the top in a couple of the courtroom scenes. Lana Turner in her screen debut also comes off very memorable especially with her giggle as she walks down the street in that tight sweater. Mervyn LeRoy does a great job at building all the suspense and anger that surrounds the controversy of the case which is based on a true story. After watching this film as well as Mississippi Burning this year it's rather amazing to know this stuff happened within the last onehundred years.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are Spoilers Even though the film They Won't Forget claims it's not based on any true events and it's characters are completely fictitious it's undoubtedly bases on truth. The film is about the trial conviction pardon and later abduction by a frenzied mob and lynching of Leo Frank on August 171915 outside of Marietta Georgia. Frank was abducted from the local jailhouse and taken out in the woods and hung for the murder of 12 yearold Atlanta girl Mary Phagan.The movie goes along the same lines as the real story that it's based on with Leo Frank portrayed as a business professor not the owner of a pencil factory from the north named Perry Hale Edward Norris. The movie also replaces Hale's or Leo Frank whom he's supposed to be ethnicity of being Jewish to being a northerner which is the real reason in the movie that the people of the small southern town of Flodden have such a bitter hatred for him. Besides that small change in history the movie nevertheless is a strong incitement of how emotions can easily take over a community and lead to an innocent mans even though it's never really proved if or not Hale was in fact innocent unjust conviction and later murder.Hale was seen at the business school where he was a professor and where pretty 16 yearold Mary Clay Lana Turner attended and was in fact a bit infatuated with him. It was on that fateful day April 26 Confederate Memorial Day that Hale was seen at the school after hours where Mary's body was later found brutally murdered. The police first grabbed the school's janitor a black man named Tump Redwine Clinton Rosemond as the prime suspect in Mary's murder. It was in fact Tump who found Mary's dead body at the bottom of an elevator shaft.Slowly all the evidencecircumstantial as it was started to point to Parry Hale. Hale not only was there besides Tump at the school when Mary was murdered but had both a blood stain on his jacket and a telegram that he's leaving town as soon as possible for a new job up north! Seeing a chance to make a name for himself and get elected senator local D.A Andrew Griffin Claude Raines took charge of prosecuting Hale and with the town already strongly prejudice against him in Hale being an outsider and Yankee to boot the outcome of the trial was already a forgone conclusion.Hale's trial and jury was so prejudice against him that after being convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to the electric chair that Governor MountfordPaul Evertonfelt that he at least should have a new trial with a change of venue in order to positively prove his innocence not the angry lynch mob that he faced back in Flodden.Sacrificing his political career Gov. Mountford let his conscience replace his future in politics by commenting Hale's death sentence to life imprisonment. This act of courage on the governors part touched off a riot in Flodden that had the outraged townspeople lead by Mary's hotheaded bother Shack Trevor Bardnett grab Hale as he was being sneaked out of town by the state police and after beating him bloody strung the terrified man up.It was only after all the dust settled an tempers cooled that D.A Griffin and most of the people who had a hand in convicting Hale including the manipulated star witness for the prosecution Tump Redwinethat a grain of doubt to Hale's guilt started to come to the surface. Hale's grieved wife Sybil Gloria Dickson was given a check by Griffin for all the trouble that she went though in her husbands trail convincing and lynching. Griffin even swore to Sybil that those who murdered her husband would be brought to justice which didn't move or impress her at all.

	onyx:emotionText "There are Spoilers Even though the film They Won't Forget claims it's not based on any true events and it's characters are completely fictitious it's undoubtedly bases on truth. The film is about the trial conviction pardon and later abduction by a frenzied mob and lynching of Leo Frank on August 171915 outside of Marietta Georgia. Frank was abducted from the local jailhouse and taken out in the woods and hung for the murder of 12 yearold Atlanta girl Mary Phagan.The movie goes along the same lines as the real story that it's based on with Leo Frank portrayed as a business professor not the owner of a pencil factory from the north named Perry Hale Edward Norris. The movie also replaces Hale's or Leo Frank whom he's supposed to be ethnicity of being Jewish to being a northerner which is the real reason in the movie that the people of the small southern town of Flodden have such a bitter hatred for him. Besides that small change in history the movie nevertheless is a strong incitement of how emotions can easily take over a community and lead to an innocent mans even though it's never really proved if or not Hale was in fact innocent unjust conviction and later murder.Hale was seen at the business school where he was a professor and where pretty 16 yearold Mary Clay Lana Turner attended and was in fact a bit infatuated with him. It was on that fateful day April 26 Confederate Memorial Day that Hale was seen at the school after hours where Mary's body was later found brutally murdered. The police first grabbed the school's janitor a black man named Tump Redwine Clinton Rosemond as the prime suspect in Mary's murder. It was in fact Tump who found Mary's dead body at the bottom of an elevator shaft.Slowly all the evidencecircumstantial as it was started to point to Parry Hale. Hale not only was there besides Tump at the school when Mary was murdered but had both a blood stain on his jacket and a telegram that he's leaving town as soon as possible for a new job up north! Seeing a chance to make a name for himself and get elected senator local D.A Andrew Griffin Claude Raines took charge of prosecuting Hale and with the town already strongly prejudice against him in Hale being an outsider and Yankee to boot the outcome of the trial was already a forgone conclusion.Hale's trial and jury was so prejudice against him that after being convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to the electric chair that Governor MountfordPaul Evertonfelt that he at least should have a new trial with a change of venue in order to positively prove his innocence not the angry lynch mob that he faced back in Flodden.Sacrificing his political career Gov. Mountford let his conscience replace his future in politics by commenting Hale's death sentence to life imprisonment. This act of courage on the governors part touched off a riot in Flodden that had the outraged townspeople lead by Mary's hotheaded bother Shack Trevor Bardnett grab Hale as he was being sneaked out of town by the state police and after beating him bloody strung the terrified man up.It was only after all the dust settled an tempers cooled that D.A Griffin and most of the people who had a hand in convicting Hale including the manipulated star witness for the prosecution Tump Redwinethat a grain of doubt to Hale's guilt started to come to the surface. Hale's grieved wife Sybil Gloria Dickson was given a check by Griffin for all the trouble that she went though in her husbands trail convincing and lynching. Griffin even swore to Sybil that those who murdered her husband would be brought to justice which didn't move or impress her at all. Sybil threw the check that Griffin gave her back in his face wanting to have nothing more to do with him and the town of Floddon as she walked out of his office and his life as well as town forever.P.S the biggest tragedy besides the tragic lynching of Perry Hale is that the actual murdered if Hale was in fact innocent of young Mary Clay was never brought to justice.

The ambitious DA who nails him is Claude Raines. Defense is provided by Otto Krueger. There are other familiar faces in the film directed for Warner Brothers by Mervyn LeRoy.I wonder what the folklorist Claude LeviStrauss would make of this. He believed that people thought in categories that thought was like language. One word was never like another word. Things were either the same or not the same. Likewise this movie seems to have very little in between one thing and its opposite. LeviStrauss would probably have applauded.The movie gives us NorthSouth Memorial DayDecoration Day GuiltyInnocent LifeDeath ReasonEmotion and a host of other oppositions. It leaves out ChristianJewish from the original case of Leo Franks. The relatives of Mary Clay stop a train carrying the convicted suspect who is about to be pardoned by the governor and they hang him off screen. None of the townspeople seem to have any doubt about what's going to happen. And nobody seems to disapprove. They don't even mourn the victim Mary Clay. Their shock turns immediately to rage without any intervening period of grief. The opposite of rage seems not to be sorrow for the lost Mary but moral innocence. I didn't do it! all the possible suspects shout. I suspect in a way the movie misses the point. It presents the story as a simple miscarriage of justice prompted by the hostility of an insular community to an outsider. But in essence a lynching doesn't necessarily have to be the carrying out of some vernacular vision of justice. That's not the point. Nor is This'll teach 'em a lesson.One important point of a lynching perhaps the main point is that it expresses community allegiance. It's a rite of intensification whose real purpose is not that different from the Memorial Day parade with which the film starts. It's like the Fourth of July or Christmas. Photos of lynchings usually show some of the spectators grinning at the camera. All that's missing is the fireworks. The significance is that this is an important community event in which WE were brave enough to take part. Once the smoke of battle clears the prevalent emotion is not the residue of rage but pride.Some of the writing is pretty good. An example. During jury deliberations one man finds a note in his pocket Vote Guilty If You Feel Like Living. He's been holding out for the man's innocence. Now he tells the others angrily that he'll stick to his principles and not be swayed by threats. Another jurist an elderly and avuncular type explains to him that he's just worried about what people will say. It takes courage to disregard a death threat and vote guilty anyway. Nobody will think the worse of him if he votes along with the others. It's a smooth way of handling a truculent dissident. Vote guilty DESPITE the threat to kill you if you don't. That's the way a real man would do it. What a sales pitch and delivered with such quiet confidence. Raines' prosecutor is equally adroit. They say we're prejudiced against Yankees. Let's show them we're NOT prejudiced by hanging this guilty one and leaving the others alone! The acting is a little overwrought on everybody's part the direction is functional and the story though camouflaged states itself quickly and then ends without much wasted motion. Even a shot of a train rattling smokily over a bridge is under cranked so it appears in accelerated motion. The court and the press are both phony and should be jailed themselves but they're not. It's a rather bitter ending when Raines and a reporter are watching the murdered man's wife leave town and the reporter muses I wonder if he was really innocent and Raines dispassionately agrees that it's a good question. The justice system is certainly an efficient way of delivering pain to a lot of people.".

	schema:headline " Excellent film based on a true story although not Claude Rains at this best";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a bit of an unusual film. First it's loosely based on the trial and lynching of Leo Frank after the murder of Mary Phagan back in 1913. The film is really about prejudice. First prejudice against Blacks when the custodian of the school where the Mary Phagan character was murdered and raped?. Second against Jews when the teacher is instead accused tried and lynched.The cast is interesting. Claude Rains plays the district attorney and I am not impressed with his performance here. Ir's so unlike how we usually see Rains that it just doesn't work and I say that as a person who usually like Rains very much.Edward Norris plays the professor ultimately accused of the crime. He seems pretty good for the part. Norris didn't have a very prolific career but his performance here works quite well. They do a nice job here with the character who appears to be innocent but who says things and acts in little ways that would lead some people to think he is guilty.Otto Kruger as Michael Gleason Allyn Joslyn a character actor who usually did nicely in comedy is here as a reporter but I wasn't very impressed.Gloria Dickson who in real life died in a fire after a short career in films does reasonably nicely as the charged husband's wife.The murdered girl is played by none other than Lana Turner. Of course she doesn't last long but it was a decent start to her career.One of my favorite character actors  Otto Kruger  aptly plays the defense attorney.Elisha Cook has a small role and one that is rather different than his typical one. A nice contrast though not overly important to the film.Clinton Rosemond is excellent as the Negro janitor although the part he plays is very stereotypical in the way that it portrays Blacks of the era. Nevertheless it is an honorable acting performance.Elisabeth Risdon plays the convicted murderer's mother a very dependable and recognizable character actress.Aside from the murder case itself an important aspect of the film was that it took place in the South thus implying that Southerners were bigots no comment as to whether that's an appropriate observation you decide. Of course you have the 2 racial aspects a Black man and then a Jew  although the Jewish angle is not tackled here and then because the Jewish character in the real life case is an educated man from the North. This substitution of a White man from the North instead of a Jew is emphasized at the beginning of the film with the Confederate soldiers who would appear to play and important role in the film...but then do not at all. The wonderful Harry Davenport plays one of the old soldiers though it is a terribly small part. The other aspect of this film that is done quite nicely is the small town environment where rumors spread like wildfire which eventually lead to a lynching.An interesting footnote  at the beginning of the film there is a rather dramatically highlighted statement assuring viewers that the characters in the film do not represent any person living or deceased. While in reality of course they do.Keeping in mind that this film was made in 1937 there's not a lot wrong with this picture. A little oldfashioned to be sure. You'll laugh at how fast the train is moving in one scene but that's minor stuff. And some of the Southern accents here are rather questionable in fact that's probably the biggest problem with Claude Rains' performance. But don't let that stop you from watching this film.In my internal rating system a good film gets a 7. It takes a Gone With The Wind or Ben Hur film to get a 10 and something just a tad lighter to get a 9. So an 8 which I am giving this film is more than just a good film but a VERY good film. Recommended.".

	schema:headline " A cutup action story nicely made by firsttimers";
	schema:reviewBody "The Traktor team has been around a while creating commercial spots for the media now moving into directing film none forthcoming as one of them said yesterday at a promotional screening and music videos Fatboy Slim being the next victim thus being newcomers on the scene of cinema while they really are not.The film is as fractioned as Magnolia Pulp Fiction and A Life Less Ordinary but that may also be its stronghold. The film mostly circles a barber Steve Zahn whose wife Lara Flynn Boyle has just left him when a nervouslooking gangster Jeff Goldblum enters the shop asking for a haircut.Saying more than this would be spoiling the film a bit as the plot is not presented chronologically and it has to do with everyone trying to get hold of three very valuable Mingdynasty coins.Many archetypes are displayed e.g. the gangster the hysterical ex wife and the stiff upperlipped englishman Tom Wilkinson although some quite interesting characters are in place e.g. a 17yearold hitman Elijah Wood a Police Inspector who has graced herself in Playboy Salma Hayek and a very nasty Timber Scout Leader David Cross.The film loses tempo from time to time but recaptures it with the help of the characters and the backandforth switching in time and place which makes up for the general lack of story. The film does appeal with its simplicity and Zahn does a great job with playing the loser as do others of the cast. The soundtrack is varied and tense not giving away commercial spots for known artists but alternative rock and some actionesque dance tracks.Making up for the dark humor of the film there is a lot of slapstick and also wordplay probably a stab at Quentin Tarantino's dialogue but here it's more earthbound and close to heart. You won't hear any Royale with cheesedrops here.All in all this is a decent actionromancefilm although there is not much romance. There is more action in this film than in your general Hollywood ones though giving way to a lot of different screening locations a very varied spectrum of characters dialogue that feels real an OK story and a good soundtrack. Go see it as an easygoing action flick that presumably won't change your moviegoing taste but will leave you with the desire for more mainstream films striving for what Chain Of Fools has achieved.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Traktor team has been around a while creating commercial spots for the media now moving into directing film none forthcoming as one of them said yesterday at a promotional screening and music videos Fatboy Slim being the next victim thus being newcomers on the scene of cinema while they really are not.The film is as fractioned as Magnolia Pulp Fiction and A Life Less Ordinary but that may also be its stronghold. The film mostly circles a barber Steve Zahn whose wife Lara Flynn Boyle has just left him when a nervouslooking gangster Jeff Goldblum enters the shop asking for a haircut.Saying more than this would be spoiling the film a bit as the plot is not presented chronologically and it has to do with everyone trying to get hold of three very valuable Mingdynasty coins.Many archetypes are displayed e.g. the gangster the hysterical ex wife and the stiff upperlipped englishman Tom Wilkinson although some quite interesting characters are in place e.g. a 17yearold hitman Elijah Wood a Police Inspector who has graced herself in Playboy Salma Hayek and a very nasty Timber Scout Leader David Cross.The film loses tempo from time to time but recaptures it with the help of the characters and the backandforth switching in time and place which makes up for the general lack of story. The film does appeal with its simplicity and Zahn does a great job with playing the loser as do others of the cast. The soundtrack is varied and tense not giving away commercial spots for known artists but alternative rock and some actionesque dance tracks.Making up for the dark humor of the film there is a lot of slapstick and also wordplay probably a stab at Quentin Tarantino's dialogue but here it's more earthbound and close to heart. You won't hear any Royale with cheesedrops here.All in all this is a decent actionromancefilm although there is not much romance. There is more action in this film than in your general Hollywood ones though giving way to a lot of different screening locations a very varied spectrum of characters dialogue that feels real an OK story and a good soundtrack. Go see it as an easygoing action flick that presumably won't change your moviegoing taste but will leave you with the desire for more mainstream films striving for what Chain Of Fools has achieved.";

	schema:reviewBody "This started off a little slow but quickly accelerated to a very quick pace. It went so fast for the last two thirds of the movie that you really had to pay attention to get everything. The twists are great and incredibly funny. The plot is pretty good not brilliant but allows for some very funny twists and some unbelievably funny but fairly unlikely very complicated situations that will make you laugh for several minutes without stopping for a breath provided that you like black humor. The actors all do pretty good jobs even Elijah Wood who I normally hate with a passion pulled off an entertaining performance. There weren't really any of the actors I was heavily disappointed by. All of the characters were funny in their own twisted sort of way most of them are either caricatures or stereotypes but they work really well together. The humor was great most of the time though some of the jokes fell flat but most of it was a treat for fans of black comedylike me. The sparse number of action scenes there was were really great. The movie has a very good fast pace throughout most of the movie there was hardly any moment where I was bored. The movie has some scenes that take place on a nonlinear timeline especially in the beginning but the moment these are over the film finds a better pace. This is not to say that these scenes were bad in fact I find them to be a great start to the film. Overall the movie was quite good but some of the humor seemed to be more there to shock than to amuse some of it did seem over the top. It could have been better had the humor been more balanced and had more of the characters been believable and likable. In the end the movie has some great laughs but that's about it. It's easily forgettable. I recommend this to pretty much any fan of black comedy. It's not the best but it's a pretty good one. If you're not easily offended and you like black humor it's worth checking out. 710".

And when it started I read the others actors of the cast! One name better than the previous Jeff Goldblum Elijah Wood Orlando Jones Tom Wilkinson David Cross. This is a good point to start watching a unknown movie discover a beautiful cast. Then the movie obviously. I love black comedy and generally all the movie with a lot of different characters which want the same things like Snatch Big Trouble And this one is absolutely the best. It's very funny which is a very hard thing to find nowadays few times banal and it has a tremendous pace in 1 hour and 35 minutes happens everything you can imagine. Moreover the plot begin almost at the end of the history and then it's a flashback followed by another flashback and so for all the actors but that is the best thing about this movie it's never really hard to figure out and although it is complex it's easy to rebuild the history which is globally believable. It's quite clean not like the majority of black comedies unfortunately it has a large number of dirty words in the Italian version I've counted more of 70 of them but they are proportionate at the characters. So isn't a deep movie to think about something it's the better way to relax yourself sometimes. Discover it because isn't famous at all!".

And surprisingly I enjoyed the movie and all its characters instead of just Elijah Wood's.The entire movie is actually based on a somewhat simple plot but there are so many people involved in it and with all the flashbacks you can actually see how they're related to one another which cracked me up.The movie is funny in its own simple ways. I wouldn't label it as 'slapstick' immediately because obviously there's a plot clinging on to it and the movie follows that plot.There were loads of funny moments. When Andy the Timberscout David Cross began insulting Miss Cocoa Orlando Jones and when Boilingsworth Tom Wilkinson tripped while walking from his car to meet Avnet Jeff Goldblum.For reasons not related to my liking for Elijah Wood hey dudes they simply ARE funny I most liked the parts when hitman Mikey Elijah Wood repeated to Kresk Steve Zahn I didn't mean to brag but do you know about Senator Dove... when in fact... uh you'll have to watch the movie to find out. the part when he cried was kind of out of the blue and the snotty man looked so strange then.The show is entertaining but the video is probably not attractive enough to be picked up by nonfans of the cast. 7 stars".

Basically Salma Hayek is a detective for a case about the ancient Chinese coins stolen from a museum the 'Shiney New Enemies'. The bloke from Road Kill is the main guy  a suicidal hairdresser  and he plays the part so well. Elijah Wood plays a 'hardboy' hitman but really he's just a big softie. The hairdresser comes across these coins after 'killing' the man who stole them somewhat accidentally. His nephew Scottie swallows them and he wants to take Scottie to France to 'fence' the coins which will be pooed out in 24 hours or so. It reminded me of a cross between All I Want or Try 17 in the US and... er... a crime movie. Very well worth watching!".

	schema:reviewBody "I was very impressed by this movie. It contained a totally awesome cast lineup was genuinely funny  very remarkable on such a low budget. And it also moves fairly tightly and briskly with none of the pretentiousness of most Bgrade arthouse fare.The cast ensemble was an absolute dream in fact. Stalwarts like Jeff Goldblum Steve Zahn David Cross David Hyde Pierce  and that lady who now plays the wife in Scrubs. They were excellent.And Elijah Wood is totally awesome in this. I once said that he had totally lost his comic touch or interest after the NORTH fiasco. Well I now have to completely eat my words. He showed a lot of the brilliant personality that he displayed as an alltime great child actor  especially as Huck Finn. This is the role that I would class as his definitive transition role from child protg to credible adult actor. It contains most of his charm and personality that were the highlights of his early career with the professional maturity of his later work.And once again I am totally blown away by Tom Wilkinson. His was a great role for a jobbing British actor in Hollywood and he handles it wonderfully. This would be the perfect foil to his dramatic antagonist in Mel Gibson's THE PATRIOT see my review and a great foretaste of his comic flair as Doctor Chasubile in THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST.This movie really worked a lot better than I thought it would. I was expecting some dour slowpaced cynical modern seriocomedy with garish visuals and poor pacing  like RUSHMORE or ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND or ADAPTATION i.e. way selfconsciously smug with far more drama than comedy. But instead I got a snappy witty intelligent little character comedy with enough imagination and pacing to really keep it rolling along. It lacks the real punch of a classic movie like THE STING Jim Carrey's THE MASK or even ZERO EFFECT but on its own terms it is very watchable and totally deserves a lot more success. I thoroughly recommend it to everyone. A movie that's definitely worth renting.".

It is a travesty and a huge mistake on someone's part. I know for a fact that this movie would go down a storm in the U.K. Yet three years after it was made it has never been seen in a British cinema never been released on video or DVD in Britain and has not yet been shown on TV either. I had to buy a video tape from Australia!But make no mistake this movie is unique and an absolutely brilliant comedy. It is a chapter of accidents in which nothing ever goes according to plan and the flashbacks where events are constantly changing are a hoot.To me personally the Orlando Jones Miss Cocoa character was a bit pointless but some would no doubt find him amusing. Otherwise the characters were a treat and superbly played. I single out Steve Zahn who was excellent as the bungling barber Kresk Elijah Wood who made me ache with laughter as a hitman the new kid on the block Jeff Goldblum as the wicked Avnet Tom Wilkinson as the English scoundrel Bollingsworth and Salma Hayek who could arrest me anytime. Butoh Devin Drewitz! Devin Drewitz was terrific as the hyperactive Scottie. He was never still for an instant. Butter wouldn't melt in his mouth but Dennis the Menace had nothing on this kid. Remember the name! The kid will go far.".

Steve Zahn is likable and charmingly goofy I guess they just hoped that would be enough...I was fairly entertained anyway though not because of the lazy fauxTarantino time shifts or the Ican'treallybebothered direction lowkey if one wants to be charitable but because most of the truckload of stars they had wheeled in has at least one or two amusing tricks they always can rely on if everything ells fails I rarely laughed at the obvious witty lines or comedy set piece bits but several times I snickered and giggled at some funny little look or tilt with the head.The plot was just the usual losers  crooks doing stuff on account of some McGuffin I thought those went out of style back when Two Days in the Valley was released but it seems like I was wrong. Still seeing Elijah Wood as a 17 year old hitman who smashes chair on people's heads was at least something different and Salam Hayek in her underwear is always nice so despite the fact that I can't really claim this is a good movie per se I would still recommend it for anyone looking for a very undemanding time killer.".

Andy could have been a riot as well he probably comes closest to being funny next to Mikey and his craving to see Cats  but most of the rest of the characters were fairly clicheed and do we really need TWO almost identicallooking bitchy women in Kresk's life?

The problem with CoF is the parts aren't strung together that well. The plot is mediocre the editing is haphazard and the story doesn't flow too well at moments.But the characters do provide quite a few laughs themselves. So it's better than your average schlocky comedy.7 out of 10.Barky".

Living handtomouth stuck in a cycle of drink abuse visits to prostitutes and deadend jobs a glimmer of hope appears when he is befriended by Shoji who offers up catalyst opportunities with the cute girl in the local bookstore. However the demons Kanta carries inside him are not so easily exorcised.Screenwriter Shinji Imaoka offers up a fascinating character study superbly executed by Mirai Moriyama in an outstanding performance. From beginning to end we are forced to shift our understanding of Kanta. You cannot help but pity a man  at 19 still in many ways a child  who has had to carry the burden of having a convicted sex offender for a father during his formative years. But then he does something disgusting like lick a girl's hand and you begin to suspect nature may win out over nurture. Aimless amoral conniving and at times misanthropic Kanta is nonetheless human and frail. You see few paths for redemption in a modern Japan where Kanta's coworker is summarily dispensed with when a workplace accident renders him disabled and for Kanta the only avenue of negotiation for rent disputes are threats and insincere apologies.Director Yamashita keeps it all plausible and authentic. At times Kanta's excesses evoke visceral disgust as his various methods of ejecting bodily fluids  and one attempt at solids  are framed in closeup. At other times there is a light jaunty tone to proceedings often dictated by the music which may just be deployed ironically given the hopeless drudgery of Kanta's daytoday existence. The comedy is threaded in nicely and never done for its own sake. Kanta's reunion with his exgirlfriend and her new beau is funny and terrifying in equal measure. Kanta seems to have the worst life imaginable till we meet his ex and glimpse the hellhole existence she endures.Kengo Kra plays Shoji as a guy trying to do his best for a friend while never losing his wariness. His patience is admirable and the loss of it forgivable. Atsuko Maeda as love object Yasuko injects a difficult role with an element of mystery. Quite why such a wellbalanced intelligent young woman would indulge a shifty creepy NEET is an active question that Imaoka's writing and Maeda's acting skill make come alive. In the hands of lesser talent this would appear a flaw in the narrative. In modernday Japan isolation loneliness and withdrawal from society is practically an epidemic and all three characters in some way embody elements of this.In the end Kanta may have found an escape. Or we may be seeing the dream that is the regret of a dying man in a rubbish heap. The film fittingly concludes with questions rather than answers. The social commentary is apt and incisive but it is the character of Kanta as unfathomable and memorable as Travis Bickle that stays with you long after the final credits.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the very start of THE DRUDGERY TRAIN the narrator tells us a couple of pertinent facts about Kanta Kitamachi at that prove to be significant to the direction his life is going. Kanta is 19 yearold his father committed a sex crime that broke up his family while he was in 5th Grade and since dropping out of school after graduating junior high Kanta has only had work as a day labourer. The freezeframe image of him leaving a seedy peepshow joint during this opening narration speaks for itself.A day labourer with no contract and no rights Kanta has little opportunity for advancement out of this life of backbreaking manual labour. What little money he earns he spends on alcohol on peep shows and massage parlours and owing four months' rent he's about to be thrown out of his cheap rented accommodation. Kanta however is not entirely beyond hope. He loves reading and has a crush on the girl who works at the bookstore but he confuses sex with his need for the warmth of human contact and friendship. His means of expression is so awkward crude and inappropriate that he ends up alienating everyone close to him and getting his head kicked in by those less sympathetic towards him.Based on a novel by Kenta Nishimura one suspects that there's some autobiographical content in Kenta's story so it might be a stretch to extrapolate an individual anecdotal story to see it as a reflection of a generational problem. Undoubtedly however it would seem like Kanta's education his development as a young man his relationships and his prospects for the future in postbubble economy Japan have indeed been influenced or affected to some extent by the actions of his elders as is suggested by the unspecified sex crime of his father. Nothing good will happen to you for the rest of your life a work colleague tells him and indeed it's hard to see how Kanta can turn his life around. Is it a kicking Kenta needs or a kick up the pants?".

	schema:headline " What America needs is a few good volcanic eruptions?";
	schema:reviewBody "As a Big Budget movie I'm sure that Volcano took more than a few months to make.  Too bad someone associated with the movie didn't take that time to wander into the local library the children's section perhaps and check out a book on Volcanoes.  I've seen Saturdaymorning cartoons that have a better understanding of lava.Instead we get many scenes of outright stupidity that would challenge even the densest of viewers.  In one scene Tommy Lee Jones and an assistant are standing near a volcanic vent and their protective suits start to melt of course skin is stronger than a protective suit so they escape unharmed. But in numerous later scenes people walk by lava like you might walk past a lake.  Maybe this is because no one seems to know it's lava.  I lost count of how many times a character said something like What is that stuff? or There's something really hot and glowing coming down the street and things are melting into it.  Wonder what it could be?In what has to be one of the worst scenes ever filmed two characters load an injured man onto the outstretched ladder of a hook  ladder truck. Then they hang onto a dangling fire hose as the ladder is lifted above the lava. The heat is so intense that the fire hose SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUSTS but our characters are unhurt their boots smoke a little.  I didn't know that fire hoses were so flammable...But Volcanois not just a dumb disaster flick with bad science.  No! It's also a SociallyImportant Commentary on our Society Movie!  Throughout the film there are numerous social messages.  These are so corny and contrived that they could only have been written by people who have never actually experienced them.  A racist cop tries to arrest a guy for assault in the middle of a disaster scene! but then the two team up to help save the day. Aww.  Later a little kid notes that everybody looks the same when covered by ash and soot.  Aww.  America's racial troubles could be ended if only a giant volcano threatened us all.More?  Oh sure there's more!  Tommy Lee Jones is the toohardworking dad who comes to value his daughter.  Said daughter is a selfish brat who learns some responsibility and respect for her dad.  There's a guy whose only role in the movie is to say obviously insulting things.  This makes him the bad guy.  One can see the writers of this movie hammering his role out  We need someone who's rich and yuppielike and snooty.  Someone like us only not as enlightened.  Someone who wouldn't make a SociallyImportant Commentary on our Society Movie like we are!  Of course bad things happen to him and all is right with the world.In the end the mysterious glowing sometimeshot substance we come to know as lava is channeled into the sea and all of LA lives happily ever after in a just and fair world.  A world of course with a big smoking volcano plopped down into the middle of it.  Certainly that won't affect the real estate values?The lessons of this movie are quite clear.  1 lava is harmless if you don't touch it 2 small children will inevitably wander into incredible harm but emerge OK and 3 only through the trauma of sudden volcanic activity will we come to appreciate the true Brotherhood of Man.Whoever thought up this movie should be thrown into a volcano...".

But in numerous later scenes people walk by lava like you might walk past a lake.  Maybe this is because no one seems to know it's lava.  I lost count of how many times a character said something like What is that stuff? or There's something really hot and glowing coming down the street and things are melting into it.  Wonder what it could be?In what has to be one of the worst scenes ever filmed two characters load an injured man onto the outstretched ladder of a hook  ladder truck. Then they hang onto a dangling fire hose as the ladder is lifted above the lava. The heat is so intense that the fire hose SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUSTS but our characters are unhurt their boots smoke a little.  I didn't know that fire hoses were so flammable...But Volcanois not just a dumb disaster flick with bad science.  No! It's also a SociallyImportant Commentary on our Society Movie!  Throughout the film there are numerous social messages.  These are so corny and contrived that they could only have been written by people who have never actually experienced them.  A racist cop tries to arrest a guy for assault in the middle of a disaster scene! but then the two team up to help save the day. Aww.  Later a little kid notes that everybody looks the same when covered by ash and soot.  Aww.  America's racial troubles could be ended if only a giant volcano threatened us all.More?  Oh sure there's more!  Tommy Lee Jones is the toohardworking dad who comes to value his daughter.  Said daughter is a selfish brat who learns some responsibility and respect for her dad.  There's a guy whose only role in the movie is to say obviously insulting things.  This makes him the bad guy.  One can see the writers of this movie hammering his role out  We need someone who's rich and yuppielike and snooty.  Someone like us only not as enlightened.  Someone who wouldn't make a SociallyImportant Commentary on our Society Movie like we are!  Of course bad things happen to him and all is right with the world.In the end the mysterious glowing sometimeshot substance we come to know as lava is channeled into the sea and all of LA lives happily ever after in a just and fair world.  A world of course with a big smoking volcano plopped down into the middle of it.  Certainly that won't affect the real estate values?The lessons of this movie are quite clear.  1 lava is harmless if you don't touch it 2 small children will inevitably wander into incredible harm but emerge OK and 3 only through the trauma of sudden volcanic activity will we come to appreciate the true Brotherhood of Man.Whoever thought up this movie should be thrown into a volcano...";

	schema:headline " The script is the real natural disaster in Volcano";
	schema:reviewBody "Watching Mick Jackson's disaster flick in which the eponymous natural disaster wreaks havoc throughout Los Angeles is like watching a 3 a.m. infomercial. It's such silly mindless fluff yet there's just something about it that keeps your eyes glued to the screen.Volcano is admittedly wellcast and acted despite a dreadful script and a plot whose summary could fit on a matchbook. Tommy Lee Jones who would give 110 making a McDonald's commercial stars as Mike Roark the hardboiled head of the Office of Emergency Management where he is assisted by his sidekick Emmit Don Cheadle. After initially poohpoohing the thought of a volcano in L.A. from geologist Amy Barnes Anne Heche who constantly ends her lines with a fourletter word like a period after a sentence it's only a matter of time before he is proved wrong before his very eyes. Other solid performances come from Jacqueline Kim Dr. Calder John Carroll Lynch Stan the oftmaligned subway boss and Keith David a great actor who is otherwise wasted here in a role as a police lieutenant who has no impact on any events in the film which is halfway over before he even appears on screen for the first time.However there's the small problem of having something resembling a good story to go with the awesome visuals which are indeed spectacular. But forget the volcano Jerome Armstrong's script poses the greatest threat to the characters. To put it mildly it's the biggest piece of clichridden muck to come along in awhile laden with plot holes smarmy sentimentality the offender here being a dog rescue scene near the beginning and heroics forced weareallbrothers morals and implausibilities. Yes this film is rooted far from reality but it should make a little sense along the way.Working at the OEM must be the cushiest job in the world for all the employees do throughout the picture is holler at each other and stare blankly at computer monitors. And why do they continuously show news broadcasts on their big screen? Is that where their disaster briefings come from? Mike's sullen daughter Gaby Hoffmann in a thankless role in the tradition of True Lies and FaceOff due to her own incompetence is suddenly thrust into peril and is thus separated from her father a subplot that helps build up what turns out to be one great big joke of an ending. Describing it here can't do it justice. After being taken to the hospital in Dr. Calder's Land Rover to receive treatment for a seconddegree burn on her right leg she is seen some time later with a bloody scab on her left cheek as she talks to Mike on the phone. And you thought your HMO was rough. Plus I seriously doubt that someone who jumps right into a pool of hot lava would slowly melt like a snowman in Miami while he screams and tosses the body of a man nearly twice his size to safety from a burning subway train. Then there's the wonderful familyoriented scene of two firemen burned alive in their overturned truck.And lest we forget that Volcano takes place in L.A. there's the obligatory racistcop episode in which a black man asking the fire chief to help his neighborhood is suddenly handcuffed out of nowhere by an officer for harassing him a tacky scene complete with groan references to Rodney King and Mark Fuhrman. The whole time he's cuffed the black man makes carefree wisecracks to the officers all while his 'hood is burning to cinders. But of course everything's eventually resolved. You're a good man the other cop praises his partner after the latter grudgingly dispatches fire trucks to the black man's neighborhood as if he has performed some immense display of generosity.In another lovely homage to L.A. there's also a looting scene where extras run incredibly slow while carrying empty boxes.And what in the world was with the constant barrage of news reporters? Did we really need someone reporting The house behind me has just exploded into flames...all hell is breaking loose! while people were running for their lives all around her? As the volcano explodes out of the La Brea Tar Pits and lava is running onto the street it's from a reporter describing this sight from where we hear one of the worst lines in the film It's as if the tar had caught fire melted and somehow expanded. Hey McFly if tar is already a liquid to begin with then how in the world can it melt?When an army of helicopters drops gallons of water on the lava blocked off on Wilshire the reporters and camera crews who are camped right up against the concrete barriers manage to stay conveniently dry the entire time.Despite a high body count scores of injured civilians and billions of dollars in damages everybody's smiling as soon as a rainfall ensues like those 7up commercials circa 1986. Feels so good comin' down! Remember that? Lots of questions are left unanswered How will they clean up and repair everything? Will a future eruption occur soon? Will the Cubs win the World Series?Yet for all its pretentiousness and gaping flaws I have to admit that Volcano was entertaining. It's a load of escapist camp that doesn't have a care in the world. And I do have to give credit where it's due somehow the filmmakers managed to keep slowmoving lava exciting for 104 minutes.Plus you can't help but get a kick out of a disaster film that includes the line This city's finally paying for its arrogance and finds the time to include a Bible quotation. 710".

	schema:headline " A pretty simplistic disaster movie with all the usual clichs but just enough stuff happening to make it passable entertainment";
	schema:reviewBody "Despite a history of major geological events in the area nobody really suspects anything when a handful of pipe engineers die from intense burns while underground. Investigating the accident OEM chief Mike Roark almost gets killed himself when an underground fissure throws up intense heat and flame. Expert Dr Amy Barnes believes that magma may be coming up to the surface of the earth and causing the events but would you believe it nobody buys it. Nobody that is until the tar pits overflow and start to pour lava onto the streets destroying everything in its path. With Roark convinced and Barnes wishing she had been wrong the race is on to protect the city. Better known as 'that other volcano movie of 1997' this film gets out the disaster movie handbook and follows it step by step. So we have a manly and practical hero an expert children and pets in peril human conflict sacrifice special effects 'bad' politicians etc etc. So far so formula and so it all continues. The basic set up does the usual things by setting up the most basic of characters for us to use as a focus before then just letting the lava go and relying on special effects to do the rest. The need to turn the drama into a specific story around Roark means that it occasionally forces him and his into unlikely dangerous positions that require them to be inches away from the action this is not convincing and at times just feels like overkill sucking any real tension out of the film.Without much real excitement the film just piles on the special effects and unfortunately these look dated with some poor back projection failing to really cut the mustard.The film soldiers on unsure of how it can keep raising the stakes while remaining plausible it doesn't! and it will satisfy those just looking for a noisy disaster movie but no more than the clichs that those produce. The script has a few digs at LA the news reporting the pet obsession etc but these don't amount to much but it works much better than the rather sickening attempts at racial commenting in the final few scenes 'everyone looks the same'  ugh!. The cast try hard to convince us that they are real people in real danger but even the talent involved cannot do much more than put on grim faces and soldier on. Jones is a good lead because he has a solid presence but even he cannot make it exciting when he is placed within inches of anything fallingburningexploding. Heche simply fits into the 'I hate it when I'm right' expert without really bringing more than competence to the role while Hoffmann simply tries to find trouble to get into anytime the film dips. Cheadle is good support but minor subplots featuring the likes of David Corbett and Rispoli only serve to highlight that the film cannot even manage to do the disaster movie stable of having each character have a background to make us care.Overall this is an average disaster movie at best and as such will only really play well to those that like that sort of thing. The script is weak and cannot wait until the lava flows but even then struggles to make it exciting throwing specific near misses at us again and again to keep us interesting. The cast have nothing to work with and make little impression but viewers may find this has just enough going for it to make it watchable if totally forgettable.".

So a more apt title would have been Lava. Or perhaps Lava Flow. Or how about It's like Lava!. Where oh where did my Volcano go? Oh where oh where can it be? It must be stuck in a different movie.Anyway Volcano Lying title! is a disaster flick. It's a very mainstream cheeseorama disaster flick. It's the kind of flick where people do noble things and your eyes are supposed to water up with emotion. Oh they'll be watering up all right. You'll be laughing your head off so much that the tears will fall. One scene stands out A guy tries to save the passengers on a subway train from the slowest moving lava in the world. So he jumps on board and starts taking people out. In his final act of selfless courage he carries the last person out as he slowly melts into the lava! I don't know about you but if lava was burning my legs to the bone I think I'd be howling in agony. I sure wouldn't be able to keep a straight face like this guy nor could I carry anything let alone a person to safety.The whole movie is like that. It's about people caring about other people. A preposterous disaster will unite us at last! Sniff sniff.  A little girl at the end of the movie notices everybody covered in black soot and remarks that they all look the same. Can't you see the message? We're all the same! Humans must help other humans! Especially when Hollywood concocts an asinine disaster flick! Save me!".

You'll be laughing your head off so much that the tears will fall. One scene stands out A guy tries to save the passengers on a subway train from the slowest moving lava in the world. So he jumps on board and starts taking people out. In his final act of selfless courage he carries the last person out as he slowly melts into the lava! I don't know about you but if lava was burning my legs to the bone I think I'd be howling in agony. I sure wouldn't be able to keep a straight face like this guy nor could I carry anything let alone a person to safety.The whole movie is like that. It's about people caring about other people. A preposterous disaster will unite us at last! Sniff sniff.  A little girl at the end of the movie notices everybody covered in black soot and remarks that they all look the same. Can't you see the message? We're all the same! Humans must help other humans! Especially when Hollywood concocts an asinine disaster flick! Save me!";

	schema:headline " Get me that lady geologist!!! spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "'Volcano' is a Bmovie at best and at worst is more of a disaster that what it's supposed to be depicting.  To be fair you have to be prepared in any movie to suspend disbelief for one major concept.  'Volcano' asks you to suspend disbelief in science human interaction and common sense.Tommy Lee Jones gets to be the studlyyet1990ssensitive head honcho of the Office of Emergency Management and he's fine when he's not stuck with the stupid dialogue the script provides.  However Anne Heche gives a howlingly bad performance as a smartass geologist who becomes Roark's love interest while the city is burning down natch.  Gaby Hoffman goes from Field of Dreams and American President to a turn as a whimpering needy and victimforlife daughter of Jones.  Don Cheadle gets to sit in a really coooool office and take Jones's phone calls doing the job that in reality Roark would and should be doing.Anyway the movie really starts going downhill when Heche's geology partner gets sucked into a lava vent while they're breaking into the subway lines. It picks up speed when Jones starts suggesting that they use buses to dam the flow of the lava flowing down the street Heche's geologist who loves to lecture everyone about The Science Of Geology being apparently oblivious to the fact that lava is hot and it melts metal and rock and a dead bus is unlikely to have much effect.  It really starts to suck when the film introduces Rodney Kinglike racial tension between two bad actors dressed as cops and an angry black man who can't understand why the fire department is busy with this large river of flowing lava.  But hey in the end the three of them will be working together to build a Krail dam to stop the lava from eating up his neighborhood even though the dam is built in the wrong direction and the material used wouldn't stop lava anyway.  Besides Krails are hardly watertight but I guess lava wouldn't think to poke its head through the gaps not when Tommy Lee Jones is glaring at it.  Don't even get me started on the strandedsubwaycar subplot where a tunnelful of hot lava is coming down but oddly enough it's not too hot to attempt a rescue it's not too smoky to see and there aren't any poisonous gases so everyone can breathe.  This must be LA Lava or Lava Lite.  You know it eats cars but is ecofriendly.There are moments of sheer camp here that almost make you wonder if this was meant to be a comedy.  For instance the two security guards packing up Hieronymus Bosch paintings have a completely meaningless and farcical conversation about weight and at the end no sooner does the little boy RoarkJones rescued note that everyone looks the same while covered in ash than a rainstorm breaks out and cleans everyone up  and then the sun comes out and Heche says something along the lines of aw shucks Roark.'Volcano' almost achieves Battlefield Earth status but except for Heche no one approaches Travoltalike badness and the technical aspects are handled pretty well.  If you are from the LA area as I am it's kind of funny to think of a lava flow wiping out Wilshire Boulevard.  I gave it a three for the effects and the little amount of tension you get from this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although this movie and I use the term loosely was made in 1997 we just watched it tonight for the first time. My husband commented that a Tommy Lee Jones movie that we'd never heard of made him a little apprehensive. I blithely watched anyway certain that if Jones was in the movie it must at least be worth two hours of my time. After all he has been one of our goto actors for years. Although Heche isn't one of my favorite actresses I was additionally reassured by seeing another wellknown face. The list of accomplished actorsactresses continued to grow so I endured more and more of this film certain that if I pushed through enough clichs and trite social statements I would arrive victorious on the other side of the plot. Alas there was no plot. It appeared to be burned by the everoozing lava of doom.The characters were paperthin. The plot was so chock full of holes that it literally distracted me from most of the special effects and acting in the movie. Was the fee for a brief consultation with an elementary science teacher too much for this film's budget? No acid rain...no toxic gasses like sulfur or hydrochloride...no deadly ash...no skinsearing heat just a few feet from the lava. Wow...it's the world's friendliest lava ever! The events were no better than the characters. Each incident was so contrived and farfetched...it's like the writers said Okay we need to get rid of the little girl NOW...and poof she's splashed by a lava bomb which burns her enough that she has to be carried to safety not from the lava but from her own helpless stupor...but just moments later in the car she is in no apparent pain and soon after is running effortlessly through the groan! building that oh no! is about to be blown up. After enduring all of this your reward is the line from the little boy at the end about all the people looking the same...which has got to be one of the worst movie lines I have ever heard. Even if it wasn't so painfully scripted it was ridiculous timing for all the characters involved. Kid and cop aside as if the mother would still be in the area and just needs to be pointed out because she just isn't speaking up...what...she's hoping to slink off into the shadows and get away from the little brat once and for all? I don't think so. Obviously the child's mother would be missing or dead  or yelling her head off to find her toddler.The token black gangsta tough hoodlum with a secret soft spot versus the chip on his shoulder narrow minded cracker cop with a secret soft spot scene made my eyes bleed. Even if such pat characters existed they wouldn't behave as the movie portrays them given the circumstances. Something about imminent fiery death and massive destruction tends to catch people offguard ya know? There are too many canned movie moments like these to mention...really it's just an embarrassing movie to watch. Those poor writers...where are they now?".

Apparently blocks of concrete in shape of a horseshoe will stop the lava from flowing around the edges of it? It's as if the movie expects me to be stupid enough to believe all of that works and it's quite creepy. In a sense I have to become more dumb to enjoy the movie.Kelly Tommy Lee Jones characters daughter in the movie is the reason why I lowered the stars from 3 to 2. Gaby Hoffmann is 15 but her character talks and behaves like she is 10. The character also appears extremely awkward needing a babysitter and apparently doesn't have a single friend in this movie. She is clingy spoiled and can't do anything without the input of others. Not even rescuing herself when lava is threatening to kill her. Nope she stands there shouting for her father to run to the car pick her up and he actually has to carry her all the way to a doctor because... well... would you expect her to be able to do it herself? Sure she had a small second degree burn on her thigh but at the hospital she walks perfectly fine and you even see her running less than an hour later.I also found the movie stupid as it claimed several hundreds had died in this incident yet it seemed you had to be a complete and utter moron to be able to die at all. Were those people really more stupid than Kelly? The only logical death in the movie was the firefighter trapped in the firetruck and one of the few characters I actually felt sorry for.In conclusion the movie is very stupid but because it has a good pace and lots of things going at all times there isn't a moment when you can take a nap since you'd miss out. It's too bad that all you get to see for more than half of the movie is stupidity.".

Nope she stands there shouting for her father to run to the car pick her up and he actually has to carry her all the way to a doctor because... well... would you expect her to be able to do it herself? Sure she had a small second degree burn on her thigh but at the hospital she walks perfectly fine and you even see her running less than an hour later.I also found the movie stupid as it claimed several hundreds had died in this incident yet it seemed you had to be a complete and utter moron to be able to die at all. Were those people really more stupid than Kelly? The only logical death in the movie was the firefighter trapped in the firetruck and one of the few characters I actually felt sorry for.In conclusion the movie is very stupid but because it has a good pace and lots of things going at all times there isn't a moment when you can take a nap since you'd miss out. It's too bad that all you get to see for more than half of the movie is stupidity.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was pretty lame. I didn't lava it. In 1997's the United States was welcome that year with two big budget volcano films. One was Dante's Peak the other is this mess of a movie. Directed by Mick Jackson the movie had a lot of things going against it. One thing is the horrible acting. Tommy Lee Jones seem to forget what movie he is in because he's channeling his inner Samuel Gerard from 1993's Fugitive with this role. Tommy Lee Jones plays Mike Roark head of the Los Angeles Emergency Management Center whom with Dr. Amy Barnes a volcanologist Anne Heche discover an actual volcano ready to emerges from the La Brea Tar Pits and destroy Los Angeles. It's up to Mike and his management team including his secondincommand Emit Reese Don Cheadle to save as much people as possible. Too bad for Los Angeles they put a guy in change for Emergency needs that has no clue how Volcanos and earthquakes work. That's really smart. Serious how does this guy not know what lava and manga is!? The ignorance of geography is just annoying. Are we supposed to believe no one in LA has a clue what a volcanic eruption or lava looks like? Sure the first time people might do doubletake. However it soon gets to the point where the film seems to be set in an alternate reality where the very existence of volcanoes is an obscure geological fact completely unfamiliar to the general public. It's an insult. For a city as large as Los Angeles the fictional and totally ridiculous volcano erupting unnoticing erupting is just out of the world unrealistic. How does this volcano get unnoticing for years from every scientist in the world over the years? Yes California is a geologically complex place with many centers of volcanic activity but most of them aren't anywhere near the Los Angeles Basin. So maybe scientist weren't looking for it but still Los Angeles area has no volcanoes active or even recently extinct. The LA basin is also full of oil wells and tar pits. Petroleum deposits cannot form geologically in the presence of volcanic activity anywhere in the vicinity you can't have oil tar and volcanoes in the same place period. It's nearly impossible to have volcanos such as a Parcutin type there. It's like me saying that the volcano on the moons are all activate when there clearly dead. Another thing that bugs me about the movie is Anne Heche. I really don't buy her as a scientist. She has to be one of the worst actress that came out from the 1990s. The movie even has the nerves to set up a love plot between the 28 year old Anne Heche and the 51 year Tommy Lee Jones. Really? Do you think that's needed for this ridiculous movie!? They have little to no chemistry. If that doesn't get you turn off the movie adds more subplots like a doctor Jaye Calder Jacqueline Kim choosing her job over her jerk husband who wants to flee the city. Why on earth did the man marry her if he's against her helping people? I would thought the word 'Doctor' who give him some clues what she does for a living. The movie even wants to deal with racism. If there wasn't enough subplots in the movie alright. There is a few scenes where a black guy and racist cop are fighting while the eruption and lava flow are going on. Only to connect with each other when the disaster threaten their neighborhoods. In a better movie and director this would be great social commentary but in this film it's deliver in such a cheesy and offending way. Even the boy last line in the end of the movie sounds tacky. Another bad character is Roark's daughter Kelly Gaby Hoffmann who tend to freeze up constantly forcing people to save her. Her clueless way to save herself cost the chance of her hero trying to save someone else's life. Does she felt any empathy about that? No! The worst instance being losing a kid she was put in charge of and when she finds him on an exploding street decides to stay there and wait to be saved. Her behavior is justified mention by an easily missed conversation between her mother and father early in the movie but gees... she so tiresomely getting saved all the time to the point that I wanted her to die in the film. There is also a lot patting scenes with characters that have little to do with the main plot. While I do like the character of Stan Olber John Carroll Lynch and his last scene was pretty damn epic. There is little reason why the movie needed him around. The visual effects were alright in the most part. Still there couldn't get the science between the lava right. I like how the heroes place concrete barriers in a culdesac so when the lava reaches them it'll dam itself but they face it in the wrong direction for the dam to work. In real life dams and bridges need to have the arc against the point with the most pressure. There are too many instances to count where individuals are standing directly on the other side of concrete barriers redirecting and holding back lava. Most of them with the ash they breathed in would have turned the insides of their lungs into pavement and killed them well before the final act. The movie was composed by Alan Silvestri. Too bad it's not that good. Overall The ads say The Coast Is Toast but to be truth the movie is toast. It's painful to watch.".

Like start walking and you're going to be okay slow. You starting to see the problem here? So yeah the movie of course tries to make its subject matter into this huge intense battle against the forces of nature but it just doesn't work. You don't buy it because every single life that's threatened seems to be so because of sheer stupidity andor carelessness. Which prevents the viewer from sympathizing.Add in the fact that the script is lazily written the dialogues are terrible and the acting is more wooden than the jungles of Amazon. Even Tommy Lee Jones is boring because he's not even trying to act. He's simply Tommy Lee Jones trying to change the flow of lava. Riveting.Not worth a watch guys. If you want to see a good catastrophe movie... well the term good is subjective within this particular genre but at least most are better than this one.".

Its a very traditional disaster film true to its genre in which the improvised hero saves the day with total heroism in a situation off total despair. The only two real characters here are the Volcano and the City because no character is truly developed not even the hero. They are faces people who do things. Sometimes they're there just to scream hysterically be scared to die to show cowardice or to create situations in which the hero will shine. Because of this the work of the actors is just OK including Tommy Lee Jones. It would be impossible for any actor to shine with such empty characters. The strongest part of the film are the action scenes stuffed with special effects. Some are so farfetched that we're forced to think that guy should be on the luckiest day of his life to survive in that unbelievable way. But anyone who is expecting a CGI show will be disappointed they're not always good and seem a bit dated in the eyes of the current audience. But it's a 1997 movie... everything has its time and of course with today's technological breakthroughs our eyes will not see this movie the same way we watched it twenty years ago. Even so there are some scenes and sequences where the film is powerful and emanates a pleasant tension that makes us uncomfortable. Not everything is bad predictable or clich.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have noticed from a lot of the other comments on here regarding this Movie is that a lot of reviewers here are bitching about the lack of scientific accuracy..... This is a BigBudget Hollywood Movie for Christ sake Get a life! you're NOT supposed to take this kind of stuff as fact... It's a 100 Minutes of Mindless escapism....Nothing More... Jeez!!!.....While I would agree mostNearly all of the situations which happen in 'Volcano' are highly unlikely such as trying to stop a flow of lava with a Bus standing inches away from molten Lava and not feeling the heat... Unlikely of course but this is Hollywood.Slight spoilers!As for the Plot here goes..... Tommy Lee Jones Plays Mike Roark The Director of the Office of Emergency Manangement Nice Title! Anne Heche What Happened to her? Plays a Geologist stretching credibility a bit too much there called Amy Barnes who team up to stop a Volcano Well Obviously! From destroying Los Angeles....and that's pretty much it. and it's full to the brim of all the usual Disaster Movie clichs such as the guy who runs the Metro doesn't believe listen to Roark  Barnes' concerns....blah....blah.... ends up being a hero while melting to death in a pool of Lava.......Lost Blonde blue eyed boy.....Scared injured daughter...... The sexy Doctor's heartless Boyfriend.....all present and correct......End of slight Spoilers!Now 1997 was a big year for Volcanoes as Dante's Peak came out the same year as this and audiences seemingly wanted neither as both Films Flopped 'Volcano' took just HALF it's 90m Budget Stateside and barely broke even Worldwide while 'Dante's Peak' took 67m stateside against a 100 plus Budget Personally though I prefer 'Volcano' as I can't stand Pierce Brosnan although neither movie really deserved to bomb.Take 'Volcano' for what it is a Big Budget Hollywood Special FX Extravaganza and don't try to think too much and moan about the inaccuracies and you WILL enjoy.... I did as Hollywood Blockbusters go this is one of the Best.".

	onyx:emotionText "I have noticed from a lot of the other comments on here regarding this Movie is that a lot of reviewers here are bitching about the lack of scientific accuracy..... This is a BigBudget Hollywood Movie for Christ sake Get a life! you're NOT supposed to take this kind of stuff as fact... It's a 100 Minutes of Mindless escapism....Nothing More... Jeez!!!.....While I would agree mostNearly all of the situations which happen in 'Volcano' are highly unlikely such as trying to stop a flow of lava with a Bus standing inches away from molten Lava and not feeling the heat... Unlikely of course but this is Hollywood.Slight spoilers!As for the Plot here goes..... Tommy Lee Jones Plays Mike Roark The Director of the Office of Emergency Manangement Nice Title! Anne Heche What Happened to her? Plays a Geologist stretching credibility a bit too much there called Amy Barnes who team up to stop a Volcano Well Obviously! From destroying Los Angeles....and that's pretty much it. and it's full to the brim of all the usual Disaster Movie clichs such as the guy who runs the Metro doesn't believe listen to Roark  Barnes' concerns....blah....blah.... ends up being a hero while melting to death in a pool of Lava.......Lost Blonde blue eyed boy.....Scared injured daughter...... The sexy Doctor's heartless Boyfriend.....all present and correct......End of slight Spoilers!Now 1997 was a big year for Volcanoes as Dante's Peak came out the same year as this and audiences seemingly wanted neither as both Films Flopped 'Volcano' took just HALF it's 90m Budget Stateside and barely broke even Worldwide while 'Dante's Peak' took 67m stateside against a 100 plus Budget Personally though I prefer 'Volcano' as I can't stand Pierce Brosnan although neither movie really deserved to bomb.Take 'Volcano' for what it is a Big Budget Hollywood Special FX Extravaganza and don't try to think too much and moan about the inaccuracies and you WILL enjoy.... I did as Hollywood Blockbusters go this is one of the Best.";

It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen and it's obvious that it didn't get many awards but for an action movie I think it's very good. The effects were great and everything looked so real. The story has a lot of fantasy in it but that is also an usual thing for action movies. The movie is very entertaining and I had a great time watching it. Anne Heche was as great as usual even tough the script doesn't give the actors much space to show their talents. If you wanna see her in a great part watch Return To Paradise.

	schema:headline " Playing To Type How Could The Japanese Be So Unemotional Yet Project Such Potent Feelings?";
	schema:reviewBody "For many Like Someone In Love may be a boring film to watch but others are about to be engrossed by characters their stories interactions and even a drive through Tokyo. Or just be fascinated by the director's style. Or love the outside of main character Akiko played by Rin Takanashi and her appearance and hate her dilemma and inconsiderate duplicity. Or be engulfed in utter dismal sorrow at the treatment of Akiko's grandmother played by Kaneko Kubota which in terms of sheer emotional sadness is second only to Tomi Hirayama's life and death in Tokyo Story. Here is a film that in turn will induce absurdity embarrassment squirming love lust hate loathing discomfort and pity. Akiko is a typical Tokyo girl. She is from Fukuroi in Shizuoka. She is pretty has a fianc and is in the city attending university. She however leads a surreptitious existence. We know this soon enough because we quickly put two and two together based on her conversation with her fianc Noriaski played by Ryo Kase and the persons she shares a table with a manipulative and filthy Hiroshi played by Denden and Nagisa played by Reiko Mori. Foreign directors in Japan could go one of two ways. It could be a Lost in Translation Sofia CoppolaGrade A or a Map Of The Sounds Of Tokyo Isabel CoixetGrade C. Look for sequences in Tokyo and Yokohoma including the entrance to Daisan Keihin Road and Aoyama Book Centre. This is not Adrift In Tokyo yet the drive at night is so commonplace and yet simultaneously so pivotal. How could one not grade this film more like the former film than the latter? As the film opens Akiko is heard but not seen. This is the first of many intrigues in a story where most things are implied and perceived and not spelt out for us. Then we see manipulation and deceit in multiple backandforths. The story unfolds in realtime as a peculiar drama in which patience is a necessity. Should one persevere the film literally makes an art form of making the viewer guess what is going on now and what will come next. Images are seen as reflections one overhears conversations being conducted offcamera and one listens for the consequences without actually seeing the incidents' instigators. There are a few sequences of levity as with Akiko's interaction with Watanabe's neighbour and the latter person's with her brother. The earlier almostmonologue itself is delivered with breathless conviction. Speaking of which each of the admittedly few cast members exudes an amazing ability to make the acting look easy when it is anything but. After all it is anything but given that the characterdriven focus and a lack of special effects and graphics will have to hold our attention. Yet they do and at length. Ryo Kase in particular delivers such a convincing performance that I for one could not have foreseen after seeing him in Hachimitsu To Clover. He might as well not have been an actor in a film but a boyfriend being lied to by a woman in his real life I am not lying to you she assures him as she lies to him and deceived as usual making Akiko a shameless wench in more than one way playing it straight as the uncaring female type while Noriaski is as bewildered as any man who has lost a woman to dishonesty. Make no mistake about it. Like Someone In Love's honesty and cruelty lies in showing Akiko as a casual and professional deceiver as she only outwardly frets to not be one or be unhappy about herself and her actions. Her acting is natural and matteroffact perhaps practiced from the life of a modern woman.The film however disappoints many with its ending. Like the rest of this piece of art leaves much to the imagination of the audience. Using the word 'piece' however might be apropos given what the director likely wanted to convey at the end. Include in the disappointed group this writer. Likely a decade ago the joke would have been that the director and studio ran out of money. A more likely culprit is the Zen of Like Someone In Love. Zen is a Chinese Buddhist school that emphasized the now above all else. Earlier in the film Watanabe sings 'whatever will be will be' and alternately counsels Noriaski to let it go and advises Akiko to stop fretting and let things happen. As it turns out he is ignored and is wrong in that sequence but the director and writer's script direction is based upon emphasizing the present moment at every turn. Amazing as it is Like Someone In Love falls short because it assumes too much and does not give us a definite ending.Like Someone In Love is quite impressive in another regard. The grandmother is never properly seen but even with the Japanese capacity to sadden her part is dismal. She is an old woman in a strange town longing for love and family having left her infirm husband behind for a day only to connect and bond and what happens instead is as sad as anything one could see. The buildup is masterful. Akiko's cruelty to among others the older generation and the latter's patience is indeed alternately reminiscent of Tokyo Story and The Only Son and even more cruel because it is so easily rectifiable and generational. Kudos goes to the direction and cinematography which depict such loneliness all around in a metropolis of thirteen million. It should be noted  because of the earlier emphasis on the Japanese sensibility  now that the story and direction come courtesy of an Iranian in this FrancoJapanese coproduction which in the latter case makes it by happenstance related to one of Japan's most controversial films In The Realm Of Senses. Akiko a beautiful woman with such an ugly life behaviour and personality except that is how it is usually isn't it?".

	schema:reviewBody "Like Someone in Love 2012 is a Japanese movie written and directed by the great Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami. Kiarostami brings his quiet thoughtful style to a culture that is surely very alien to him. Japanese viewers may note cultural errors in the movie. My thought is that Kiarostami can look beyond cultural differences to universal themes.The movie set in Tokyo stars Rin Takanashi as Akiko a young provincial woman who is a call girl. She doesn't walk the streets. She works out of a bar whose owner arranges the sessions at people's homes. As the movie opens Akiko is facing two immediate problems. Her jealous boyfriend is on the phone demanding to know where she is. Akiko is a college student and her boyfriend is aware of that. He doesn't know that she's a prostitute but he can sense that something isn't right and he suspects her of cheating.Akiko's grandmother is visiting Tokyo that day and desperately wants to see Akiko. Akiko would love to meet with her but the bar owner is adamantshe must go out on a call to an important client. The client is Professor Takashi Watanabe played by Tadasi Okuno. Akiko has no choice but to ignore her grandmother and visit the professor's apartment.Prof. Watanabe is a gentle lonely widower. He has prepared a special dinner for Akiko and he's playing Western music. It's Ella Fitzgerald singing Like Someone in Love. It's more like a seduction scene than a paid sexual encounter.Akiko spends the night at the professor's home and he drives her to the university the next morning. It's at that point that the film takes a different turn because Akiko's violent boyfriend confronts her on the university steps. All of this action takes place in the first third of the movie. In the remainder of the film Kiarostami continues to explore this unusual and somewhat threatening love triangle. This interaction among three very different individuals provides a fascinating look into human relationships. Where these relationships will lead isn't always obvious or predictable. I enjoyed this intelligent thoughtprovoking movie. It will work well on DVD. It's worth seeking out and watching.".

	schema:headline " Beauty is in the subtleties";
	schema:reviewBody "Most of what happens in this film is implicit and off screen. The director chooses to focus on a few brief encounters and a newly forged fragile relationship between a call girl and an esteemed older Sociology professor who lives 1 hour outside of the city. Though seemingly simple plotwise the brilliance and intricacies come to life in our minds long after the film ends.The audience isn't provided with a substantial backstory this is a sliver of time we're exposed to and we reckon that Akiko is a student who moved to Tokyo and struggled with finances so she began moonlighting as a call girl after her classes and exams after finding success due to her exceptional though generic beauty. She mentions that she often reminds people of others perhaps her universal familiarity is her allure allowing her clients to project whatever they want her to be leaving the real Akiko unfamiliar to everyone including herself clearly a stranger even to her suspicious for good reason and controlling fianc who we can assume gives the emotionally damaged Akiko some sense of stability in a twisted form of consuming love that she can accept. It's unclear if the relationship was ever good or if Akiko's compartmentalization and doublelife has created the toxic dynamic that exists in the time we're privy to.Akiko's pimp sends her to a client old enough to be her grandfather. Formerly a student of this aging Sociology professor her pimp holds him in high esteem. It's apparent that Akiko seems comfortable immediately with the professor and undresses soon after she arrives and passes out in his bed. He's patient with her despite her refusal to eat dinner with him which he prepared for her and silently watches over her as she sleeps. The next morning he takes her to school while she continues to sleep. In our sleep we are the most vulnerable so these scenes show us the immediate comfort the two feel in each others' presence.While he waits for her he meets Akiko's fianc who is also waiting for her. Through masterful and cryptic dialogue the fianc assumes the professor is Akiko's grandfather. We see what we want to see seems to be the message the director is insisting on despite very obvious clues that not all is what it seems ex. Akiko's fianc has an advertisement with Akiko's photo on it advertising her services Akiko never mentioned her grandfather visiting only her grandmother and her grandfather is a fisherman not a professor. The ambiguity of their relationship echoes that of Abbas' film 'Certified Copy' where we're not sure what's real what's pretend what's a dream and who's who.The abrupt ending literally shatters a lot of what we've come to understand in this poetic soft film. Perhaps making up for the slow beginning and shocking us to our senses the ending calls into question a much more that happens non diegetically how did the fianc find out within the few hours he was denying the truth and now? Is the Professor alright? With so little actually explained in the film our minds run wild with answers filling in the complex backstories that we personalize.All we really understand is that the Professor sees Akiko as familiar because she resembles his wife and granddaughter and though nothing sexual happens at least on screen the nature of their relationship from the outset is of sexual expectations. Perhaps this film is really discussing the innocence of what has darker pretenses on the exterior while also evaluating the darkness that exists within an innocent exterior Akiko.".

Stories which belong to us ordinary people! Aren't they important? And Kiarostami doesn't conceal this fact that he likes Haiku and Japanese culture but he doesn't have any idea how this feelings came up to him. He started writing poems that resembled Haiku when he was just 20! The serene nonchalant and often profoundly philosophical language of haiku allows the poet to swiftly touch on the core of the universal human condition love despair humor death as his movies do and now Kiarostami made his last movie and one of the best ones where Haiku was blossomed Japan. All these said I can't ignore the innovative cinematographic techniques he used in Like Someone in Love that adds to the beauty of this movie. Remember the first scene in the bar with Camera fixed on a table the girl is talking in behind while we see other people activities. We don't know what we should track. The other scenes in the car which camera plays with lights and shadows are just magnificent. I'm really amazed how delicately he sets up these all. Every detail is deliberated.

	schema:headline " A Moody Film About The Impossibility of Love";
	schema:reviewBody "Anyone expecting the classical forms of plot and characterization in this film will be sadly disappointed. LIKE SOMEONE IN LOVE has a minimal plot  a young student Akiko Rin Takanashii who may or may not be a prostitute visits the home of elderly writer Takashi Watnabe Tadashi Okuno an affection develops between them even though no physical contact takes place. Watnabe encounters Akiko's fianc Noriaki Ry Kase and convinces him that the two are related Noriaki finds out that Watnabe is lying and comes to his apartment and smashes a window Abbas Kiarostami's focuses more on shifting moods  the sad resignation of Akiko as she goes about her business neither enjoying nor appreciating it the blank face of the cabdriver who takes her to Watnabe's apartment the wistful looks of Watnabe as he looks at Akiko for him she might be both desirable yet also an object of regret for his own lost youth. Kiarostami refuses to give us the security of explaining his characters' motivations he leaves it up to us to make our own decisions. Comprised of long closeups interspersed with shotreverse shot sequences the film is more focused on what is not said rather than the dialog. What gives LIKE SOMEONE IN LOVE its true freshness is the quality of its visual imagery the film is chock full of prison images we see the protagonists sitting in Watnabe's car through the windscreen the world outside reflected in the class the bright lights of Tokyo streets fade into a blur as the yellow cab drives through seemingly endless long and straight boulevards Akiko is seen sleeping in Watnabe's bed through the frosted glass of the bedroom door while Akiko and Watnabe exchange their dialog in the confined spaces of Watnabe's apartment or Watnabe's car. Through such techniques Kiarostani shows us how the characters are prisoners both of themselves  and their inability to disclose their feelings  and the urban environment which confines them both night and day. The denouement is both unexpected and in terms of the film's thematic preoccupations quote shocking by smashing Watnabe's window Noriaki both literally and figuratively tries to break the prisonlike atmosphere. But there is a sad irony here although we see the window breaking we do not see any resolution as far as the characters are concerned. The title and the Ella Bitzgerald song that is heard regularly on the soundtrack are likewise ironic the characters can never fall in love but they merely act like someone in love.".

LIKE SOMEONE IN LOVE has a minimal plot  a young student Akiko Rin Takanashii who may or may not be a prostitute visits the home of elderly writer Takashi Watnabe Tadashi Okuno an affection develops between them even though no physical contact takes place. Watnabe encounters Akiko's fianc Noriaki Ry Kase and convinces him that the two are related Noriaki finds out that Watnabe is lying and comes to his apartment and smashes a window Abbas Kiarostami's focuses more on shifting moods  the sad resignation of Akiko as she goes about her business neither enjoying nor appreciating it the blank face of the cabdriver who takes her to Watnabe's apartment the wistful looks of Watnabe as he looks at Akiko for him she might be both desirable yet also an object of regret for his own lost youth. Kiarostami refuses to give us the security of explaining his characters' motivations he leaves it up to us to make our own decisions. Comprised of long closeups interspersed with shotreverse shot sequences the film is more focused on what is not said rather than the dialog. What gives LIKE SOMEONE IN LOVE its true freshness is the quality of its visual imagery the film is chock full of prison images we see the protagonists sitting in Watnabe's car through the windscreen the world outside reflected in the class the bright lights of Tokyo streets fade into a blur as the yellow cab drives through seemingly endless long and straight boulevards Akiko is seen sleeping in Watnabe's bed through the frosted glass of the bedroom door while Akiko and Watnabe exchange their dialog in the confined spaces of Watnabe's apartment or Watnabe's car. Through such techniques Kiarostani shows us how the characters are prisoners both of themselves  and their inability to disclose their feelings  and the urban environment which confines them both night and day. The denouement is both unexpected and in terms of the film's thematic preoccupations quote shocking by smashing Watnabe's window Noriaki both literally and figuratively tries to break the prisonlike atmosphere. But there is a sad irony here although we see the window breaking we do not see any resolution as far as the characters are concerned. The title and the Ella Bitzgerald song that is heard regularly on the soundtrack are likewise ironic the characters can never fall in love but they merely act like someone in love.";

Dissection of the title alone provides so many interesting clues and directions for the film to take in addition to what was analyzed previously. And while it does in fact address those interesting ideas indirectly it is as minimal as any filmgoing audience could possibly stand. We essentially watch an unexplained relationship unfold in almost realtime just under 24 hours.Akiko Rin Takashi is a collegeaged girl up to something in the big city of Tokyo that is probably not good for her. She's having an argument with her boyfriend on the phone and she's saying no to a job that a middleaged man is offering her. This middleaged man is clearly her pimp and no means yes sir I will do whatever you tell me to. So into the cab Akiko goes and we begin to worry about her safety. We spent an awful long time worrying about her safety with no idea what lies ahead for her. The cab ride was two hours long and we saw a lot of it. Akiko arrives at the apartment of an older gentleman looking for companionship. We don't really know what exactly Takashi Watanabe Tadashi Okuno wanted with Akiko and then in the morning he drives her back to Tokyo. Another long car ride.Visually the car rides were impeccably shot. The scenery was reflected in the windshield and we could still see the characters' faces behind. Unfortunately we don't really know what's happening with these characters during these long car rides. Sometimes a car ride is just a car ride.Eventually we meet Noriaki Ryo Kase Akiko's offensive boyfriend. And he starts putting the relationships into perspective. A different perspective. He allows Akiko and Watanabe to act differently than they actually are which allows us to start seeing them as they actually are. And then it ends. Well not quite that quickly but without giving anything away it ends.We're given so little on screen to examine that it can be frustrating even to the viewers that appreciate the subtle beauty in film. Two weeks after first seeing it my mind has started to form a few opinions on what was being said but it's still a bit too little too late.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had never before seen a film by Abbas Kiarostami. But he is an esteemed film maker having won a Palme d'Or in Cannes and Iranian directors have quite a reputation so I thought I could enjoy this movie. How wrong I was. The most appropriate word to describe this film is annoying. It consists of extremely long shots with a static camera confusing dialogue and distracting side stories that don't serve any purpose. I have nothing against slow movies in fact sometimes I like them a lot. But in this movie the director seems to make all possible efforts to make everything as least attractive as possible. The audience has to endure slow conversations about whether the lead character resembles someone on a painting or about the crush a woman has had all her life on an aging neighbour. That would be tolerable if it served any purpose if it added something to the story or the mood of the film. But it doesn't.The camera registers a day in the life of Akiko a student who secretly works as a call girl. She ignores her grandmother who calls her to have lunch during her visit to Tokyo but instead visits a bar and takes a taxi to visit a client although she is supposed to prepare her exams. By pure coincidence the client meets her boyfriend who doesn't know about her work and her secret life is exposed. All this in a few excruciatingly long and slow scenes. Of course there are people who argue that this kind of film deliberately denies the rules of mainstream movie making. It's different and we're not used to that. Why does everything have to serve a purpose? Why can't things just happen because they do? Just like in real life? And why are we annoyed when these things are filmed with a motionless camera instead of with fast edited slick camera movements? True. It can be quite refreshing to see directors moving away from what movies are supposed to look like. But in this case it felt too much like showing off. By trying to do his own thing Kiarostami neglects the needs of the audience. The best thing about this movie is the Ella Fitzgerald song it's named after which is featured on the soundtrack.".

	schema:reviewBody "The great Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami made Like Someone In Love in Japan but it could have been set anywhere for this is a film that knows no boundaries or borders. As you would expect from Kiarostami it's brilliantly written and directed and beautifully played particularly by Tadashi Okuno as an old professor whose loneliness draws him to a young student supplementing her income by working as an escort. He's not looking for sex just conversation and company and when the next day they run into her jealous boyfriend the old man allows himself to be mistaken for her grandfather ... and then the boy finds out the truth.It's a film of mostly small dramas and when violence finally erupts Kiarostami keeps it off screen. For the most part these people simply talk about their problems their relationships and life itself and Kiarostami films sequences in 'real time' and with a fixed camera just as he does in his Iranian films. I found it mesmerizing at times funny sometimes moving and in the end really rather shocking. It makes for essential viewing.".

	onyx:emotionText "The great Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami made Like Someone In Love in Japan but it could have been set anywhere for this is a film that knows no boundaries or borders. As you would expect from Kiarostami it's brilliantly written and directed and beautifully played particularly by Tadashi Okuno as an old professor whose loneliness draws him to a young student supplementing her income by working as an escort. He's not looking for sex just conversation and company and when the next day they run into her jealous boyfriend the old man allows himself to be mistaken for her grandfather ... and then the boy finds out the truth.It's a film of mostly small dramas and when violence finally erupts Kiarostami keeps it off screen. For the most part these people simply talk about their problems their relationships and life itself and Kiarostami films sequences in 'real time' and with a fixed camera just as he does in his Iranian films. I found it mesmerizing at times funny sometimes moving and in the end really rather shocking. It makes for essential viewing.";

He films the air of anticipation the cautious exchange. True to Japan he films the drama with no needless suffering as awareness with that faint melancholy they know over there as mono no aware which comes from a notion of time where things are not inevitable as we understand in the West when we talk about fate nor could they be anything else than what's before the eyes.What will be will be says the old man who poses as the grandfather to both protect the girl and conceal his misdeed. We have this wonderful ambiguity all through the thing. There is no problem of evil see in Buddhism and Kiarostami's cinema alike. No moral blame in that the girl does what she does to go through college and ignores her grandma or that the old man desired the company of someone like her that night or even that he lies about being the grandfather.But when what will be is finally at hand and the old man looks confused and foolish as he faces a beating what's the good of all the philosophizing then? But that's when Kiarostami abandons the story probably thinking he has evoked enough and we should mull over the rest. I consider this a real miss a poor ending. We don't need any concrete answer of course. It's just that ending it at that point in the story with the karmic noise but not the echo back into life we forget all about the girl the sweet fragile self who is not the dolledup face in the flyer we forget about the waiting grandmother it's all cleaved away from the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every now and then I search IMDb's list of movies to find something to watch when I feel like I have seen everything I could have wished to watch. But I stumbled across this movie saw the trailer and gave it a shot. It had a sort of Lost in Translation vibe to it so I gave it a chance.Like Someone In Love focuses on three main characters. The first being Akiko played by Rin Takanashi who is a college student who does escort work Noriaki played by Ryo Kase who is jealous manboy who vies for Akiko's affections and then Takashi Watanabe played by Tadashi Okuno who is an old man who asks for Akiko's company from her boss pimp Hiroshi played by Denden.The story for the film deals with Akiko's life as an escort. At first though you think it is simply about this young girl dealing with a jealous boyfriend but as the movie goes on we realize that Hiroshi a sort of pimp is perhaps forcing Akiko into her current profession. But unlike Akiko's friend Nagisa played by Reiko Mori who seemingly is given to whoever Akiko is special. Because of this she seemingly has some leeway but ultimately she belongs to Hiroshi who sends her to be with his former professor Takashi. Upon meeting him we assume the worst e.g. the pervy old Japanese man who probably buys underwear from vending machines. Luckily though he seems to be more so the type of old man which wishes for some company and conversation rather than sex with a 20something year old. After meeting he takes on the role of pretending to be her grandfather thanks to various characters having said assumption. But then we meet Noriaki the wouldbe jealous boyfriend and with him you realize as well as when you reflect on the film why the title of the film is Like Someone In Love.Now the film itself is very strange. The reason for this is because you aren't ever really sure where it is going. Akiko appears and as you get comfortable with her you think the worst. However until we meet Noriaki the film seems very light and sort of sweet. The reason I say this is because Takashi after you realize he isn't a perv you realize is just a sweet old man who wants some company. His wife is gone daughter is who knows where and all he has is books and no real human company. So it makes his moments with Akiko sweet until she decides to try to flirt with him. Another thing I liked was Noriaki's character to a point. To be honest while I find his patriarchy point of view problematic you had to give it to the actor portraying him. Very much so the bit he is able to do within the movie made me think of Laurence Fishburn as Ike Turner in What's Love Got To Do With It. But instead of charm he gave us genuine vulnerability which is why I called him a man boy in the character introductions. You can see he really does have feelings for Akiko but he has feelings for the idea of her and because he can't advance to really get to know her he is unable to deal with his frustrations so he lashes out. With all that said though if you just watch the movie and don't really analyze it you wonder what was the point of the movie? Before writing this review I didn't get this movie at all. However after going to the IMDb boards and checking some comments only then you understand what this movie is trying to portray. Before that though I was wondering what were we necessarily supposed to get out of Akiko's adventures with this lonely old man? Was he supposed to play fauxgrandpa long enough to save her? Make up for her ditching her grandma because she was forced to work? And what of Noriaki? The boy has issues and we aren't fully sure how in the world those two came together. Was he someone she knew before her profession or during? Much less the ending is so abrupt that it makes the film feel slightly incomplete.Overall Worth Viewing but No Rush As a film I would say off the bat I wouldn't physically go to the movies or really go out of my way to see this. But I must admit that I grew to appreciate it once I fully understood the intentions of the movie and began to appreciate the character portrayals. With that said though I feel if I need to put a disclaimer or search about to get a movie perhaps it isn't worth really recommending. So while it isn't a bad movie even after it being broken down it doesn't really stand out in any way to make it worth recommending.".

A previous reviewer mentioned that he thought that 'Once Upon a Time in Anatolia' was more successful in its use of the slow burn. I felt myself that once that excellent movie moved back to the city it lost that mystical intrigue and bordered on the ponderous.

Most people have mentioned that the abrupt ending comes so unexpectedly and so swiftly that it feels to some like they've been cheated. I can understand that point of view as you want to know how things pan out and you DON'T but I don't think Kiarostami is interested in narrative structure in the way that Hollywood would insist upon. His interest lies in identity and concealment and how our behaviour and persona are affected by our relationships with others. And there are not many countries where the real self is more consistently hidden beneath a veneer than Japan.All in all I was mesmerised partly due to the physical beauty of Rin Takanashi and the fragility of her character. The phone message sequence in the taxi is absolutely heartbreaking. The look of the film had me transfixed also the reflections on glass windows and the deliberate physical compartmentalisation of the characters was such a vital part of the film's meaning and was also aesthetically beautiful.I can't wait to see it again but I know others may feel differently.".

	schema:reviewBody "Crossing cultures and language barriers is something happening more and more in cinema with wellknown directors establishing their name for making films from their homeland looking abroad to try out their skills in a different culture. With 'Like Someone to Love' Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami heads to Japan to work with a Japanese cast and crew to look at the concept of love from various different angles and perspectives. Akiko a young student working as a prostitute ignores both her grandmother and fianc to let herself be talked into working the night before an exam. But her client an aging academic seems more to simply want an evening's company than full sex with a woman. Seeing her off to her exam the next morning both Akiko and her client Takashi are left to deal with the consequences of her deceit. 'Like Someone in Love' is a film that is lacking in many respects but indulgent in others. Various plot holes leave the audience having to make their own deductions as to how things developed rather than making it clear on watching. Time that could have been spent on this is instead spent on lengthy shots with little actual action. The first two scenes consist of one half of an extended phone conversation followed by a close up of Akiko in the back of a taxi listening to all seven of her voicemail messages. With this the case the audience can be forgiven for thinking that the next two hours will be excruciatingly long. The film despite lacking in plot is more an analysis of the different relationships Akiko has with the people in her life her dutiful grandmother whom she ignores her pronetoaggression fianc Noriaki whom she deceives and her client the aging Takashi whom she turns to in crisis. The most likable of the three main characters is Takashi whose bumbling around Akiko provide some humour and his earnest assistance to her show him to simply be a kind man that is lonely. His discussion with Noriaki is perhaps the film's most important indicating that neither Noriaki and Akiko are ready for marriage. But while humour and wisdom come from Takashi in parts other flaws lead 'Like Someone to Love' to miss as much as it hits. While the question is asked as to what Akiko sees in Noriaki the question could also be asked with the roles reversed with the only good relationship Akiko appearing to have one with someone she has known less than 24 hours making her less of an appealing character than required in the lead coming across more as a spoiled brat than abused victim. The sudden development in Noriaki's anger requires assumptions to be made rather than good storytelling. The intentional sudden and abrupt ending shows the problems that misguided love has brought the trio to and in that sense the film works in getting its point across. Though one could argue that Kiarostami takes too long to get there. Having made many shorts in the past perhaps 'Like Someone to Love' would have been better made in a much shorter format with the idea good but the execution like the film's characters somewhat misguided and indulgent.".

His discussion with Noriaki is perhaps the film's most important indicating that neither Noriaki and Akiko are ready for marriage. But while humour and wisdom come from Takashi in parts other flaws lead 'Like Someone to Love' to miss as much as it hits. While the question is asked as to what Akiko sees in Noriaki the question could also be asked with the roles reversed with the only good relationship Akiko appearing to have one with someone she has known less than 24 hours making her less of an appealing character than required in the lead coming across more as a spoiled brat than abused victim. The sudden development in Noriaki's anger requires assumptions to be made rather than good storytelling. The intentional sudden and abrupt ending shows the problems that misguided love has brought the trio to and in that sense the film works in getting its point across. Though one could argue that Kiarostami takes too long to get there. Having made many shorts in the past perhaps 'Like Someone to Love' would have been better made in a much shorter format with the idea good but the execution like the film's characters somewhat misguided and indulgent.";

	schema:headline " Spatiotemporal Structure of Like Someone in Love";
	schema:reviewBody "The very initial scene in Like Someone in Love begins with a voice off. We know that this is a way of expansion of the space. When it comes to Kiarostami it also has a philosophical approach to the process of making a meaning out of something. In case of a voice off where we hear the speaker and see the listener especially when two people are having a conversation our attention is drawn to the listener. The listener then is the subject of the scene. She is the meaning maker. We read the scene through hisher reaction a change on hisher face. The philosophical approach arises here. The director implies that the person who receives the information and processes it in the background of hisher own thoughts is the actual meaning maker. Not what is said is important but how it is perceived is what matters. At the end of the first scene we see the images of Akiko and her boss juxtaposed to each other. At this moment when the speaker and the listener come together what is said is properly perceived and makes sense so that Akiko decides to visit her customer I think. This is that aha moment which is constructed by the contribution of both parties and intensified by such a juxtaposition.On the other hand the timing of the first scene is very linear. We realize that the timing of this scene is soscaled to our daily life timing from the very initial. We literally wait for Akiko's return when she goes to the bathroom as if we are a guest in that bar waiting for her which is not very conventional in mainstream movies but frequent in Kiarostami's movies.In the taxi while Akiko is going to the house of her customer she listens to her voice messages from her grandmother. We never see the grandmother yet we are aware of her presence from the conversation between Akiko and her boss even from very beginning. Here she is being visible while invisible in a manner. Why do we have to hear her in the taxi then? We know that she exists and the story that she wants to visit her granddaughter while she's in Tokyo so why more of a proof? What I think is that the director is interfering here and now he is being visible while invisible. We know that this is the director's touch so that here he is as well.The space is expanded in two layers in the taxi scene. In one layer Akiko is above the taxi driver with her being aware of the grandmother's complaints. In the other layer we are above both of them. Linearity of the timing however is disrupted in the taxi through the voice messages that take us from the taxi to the earlier hours of the day.There is one thing that is interesting here though. The first 3 voice messages are from the grandmother. We perceive them through the face of Akiko. We are expected to observe her while she receives these messages. However the voice messages of the grandmother are interrupted by two other messages that were sent by some irrelevant people. While she is listening to those messages the camera turns its attention to the street and we no longer perceive the messages through the face of Akiko. That is why I consider those interruptions to be irrelevant and I think this is the touch of the director again where he is being visible through an invisible interference. From the last message till the other day the linearity of the time is restored. We see all those turns on the road waits on the red light the other cars in the traffic and we hear the turn signal the radio so that we're restored to the reality of that moment. From now on we wait for that slow process of Akiko's putting on her make up. The necessity that the driver had to call the customer to ask the address could not be skipped even though this was an attempt in vain. That phone call from the friend of the customer had to be received. These are all the supporters of the linearity of the time anymore. The phone call in addition to its contribution to perception of the time being originated from a different location is another example that disrupts the perception of the space for the audience.The juxtaposition that we saw in the first scene is also repeated in the meeting scene of Akiko and her customer. The scene begins with a conversation where the audience interprets the flow of the dialog through the face of the listener and it ends with juxtaposition of the speaker and the listener on a different texture this time through the screen. Here acting as a mirror the screen allows the audience to physically expand the space.This scene is followed by the car scene where we see the characters from out of the front window of the car. Now the director is compressing the space with this shooting technique trapping the characters inside the car. The compression of the inside of the car is even more exaggerated by the shadows of the clouds and the outside world. As the clouds are large and the shadow of everything out of that small car is imposed on them the characters are even more trapped in the car. It could be a sunny day with no clouds or no reflection. But would we have the same feeling of being contained in a squeezed space then? I believe Kiarostami has an intended touch here too making himself visible again.Another example that gives the sense of realtime timing is when the boyfriend and the customer are having a conversation in the car. Initially we wait for the boyfriend to finish smoking and we experience the hesitation that he goes through during that time not skipped a good detail. Then a long conversation begins. This scene is very typical of Kiarostami who is known for making sophisticated conversations taking place in a car. While reading Kiarostami we should always consider the audience since he believes that the final decision about his films is made on the minds of the spectator. In this car scene the spectator is taken into the car being included to that trapped space. She is not a spectator anymore but is a moderator of an argument. She is forced to perceive the argument digest it and not allowed to remain distant. This inevitable attraction towards the conversation is achieved through the shooting preferences of the director who placed the camera hence the spectator into the car. When Akiko returns after her exam is finished the argument ends hence the moderator is kicked out of the car also the camera and becomes the spectator again. Until the end of that scene whose remaining is not that philosophically sophisticated anymore the spectator stays on the out of the car. Eventually when they reach to the car service the argument begins again so that we are taken back into the car.In the following scene when the customer arrives home there is a voice off which is not only used as a means of expansion of the space but also used as a way of incorporating the audience. We do not see the owner of the voice in this scene yet the customer answers her directly looking at the camera. Therefore in a way the spectator becomes the owner of the voice as if the customer was answering our questions. We are the owner of the voice with a cost of being put in a disturbing position since the neighbor's questions annoy the customer. Eventually we feel distant from the neighbor even though we are her.In the consecutive scene however the audience is alienated from the scene though having more empathy for the neighbor. Now we see the actual owner of the voice who is allowed to be seen from the behind a small window telling the story of her handicapping life. How she has to be attached to her brother is intensified by how she is attached to that window how she is an object with which the main story has barrier in between. Now she is trapped in that house in her life which we perceive as a spectator observing her out of the window. We are now alienated from her yet we feel more empathy towards her. Such spatial arrangement through a shooting technique allows the audience to have more intuition about even a random character and hisher own position as an audience.In Like Someone in Love the space is expanded or compressed as the scene demands using different shooting techniques. The time is constructed in a linear manner in general. However this linearity is sometimes disrupted by phone calls or voice messages. The spatial and temporal structure of Like Someone in Love is a complex one with layers and layers most of which might not be even covered in this analysis.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film in my humble opinion has been misunderstood by the public judging by the comments I've heard about it. First of all the director Cedric Kahn is one of France's most interesting figures to come out in the last years. He knows what he is doing and what's more he's being naughty in the way he presents his story that makes us see it one way but is it what we are seeing real? The adaptation by M. Kahn and Laurence Ferreira Barbosa takes the Georges Simenon story from America to France.The most interesting thing about Antoine is that he is an ordinary man. He is married to a Helene who is a more successful person Helene is a lawyer who must make a lot of money much more than Antoine. As a couple we can't see them together at all. Antoine is a man who is not handsome. Helene on the other hand is a beautiful woman and we wonder what brought them together in the first place? We witness Antoine going to the bathroom where he ogles his own wife in the shower. It appears their sexual life has ended long before we meet them.Antoine has a drinking problem. On the trip to pick up their children they encounter heavy traffic. As they take a detour from the main highway their troubles start. We see the passing red lights of the different bars beckoning Antoine to stop and have another beer or a beer with a chaser. To make things worse they hear on the radio about the escapee from the Le Mans prison near to where they are traveling.

	onyx:emotionText "This film in my humble opinion has been misunderstood by the public judging by the comments I've heard about it. First of all the director Cedric Kahn is one of France's most interesting figures to come out in the last years. He knows what he is doing and what's more he's being naughty in the way he presents his story that makes us see it one way but is it what we are seeing real? The adaptation by M. Kahn and Laurence Ferreira Barbosa takes the Georges Simenon story from America to France.The most interesting thing about Antoine is that he is an ordinary man. He is married to a Helene who is a more successful person Helene is a lawyer who must make a lot of money much more than Antoine. As a couple we can't see them together at all. Antoine is a man who is not handsome. Helene on the other hand is a beautiful woman and we wonder what brought them together in the first place? We witness Antoine going to the bathroom where he ogles his own wife in the shower. It appears their sexual life has ended long before we meet them.Antoine has a drinking problem. On the trip to pick up their children they encounter heavy traffic. As they take a detour from the main highway their troubles start. We see the passing red lights of the different bars beckoning Antoine to stop and have another beer or a beer with a chaser. To make things worse they hear on the radio about the escapee from the Le Mans prison near to where they are traveling. We see the roadblocks and the erratic way in which Antoine begins to drive.After one pit stop Helene disappears. She has decided to take the train and leaves him a note. Antoine goes to the station but he is late. Thus begins what will be a long night adventure along rural nocturnal France.Without giving away what happens we watch Antoine waking up.

	schema:reviewBody "Red Lights is a strange abstract almost existential exercise in movie making. Adapted from the 1953 novel by Georges Simenon and set to Debussy's elegantly creepy Nuages writerdirector Cedric Kahn offers up movie with attributes of a Hitchcockian suspense thriller.The feeling of foreboding begins immediately when we meet Antoine Dunant JeanPierre Darroussin a lowlevel insurance executive. He's just leaving his job to meet his beautiful wife Hlne Carole Bouquet in a local caf. They are planning to drive to the countryside from Paris to pick up their kids from summer camp.But as soon as Antoine gets to the caf he guzzles three beers back to back with one eye on the street lest his wife arrive before he's suitably fortified. It soon becomes pretty obvious that their marriage is far from happy  Antoine armed with enough drink to sink an elephant settles into a manner of truculent impetuosity while Helene remains detached cold and almost abusive.While in the road Helen discovers that her husband is utterly plastered. She hardly says anything as he weaves all over the road but her silence speaks volumes. Thus starts a trip of barely controlled hostility with the husband clenching the wheel and brooding while the wife fumes beside him. Both are so busy bickering with each other and thinking dark thoughts that they're half oblivious to news reports of an escaped convict on the loose nearby.Antoine isn't usually a drinker but something has snapped in him and as the neon signs of the roadside bars start to beckon him he becomes obsessed with downing as much cold beer and whisky as he can. He leaves Helene angrily waiting in the car while he goes into yet another bar to prepare himself for the long night ahead.Hlne freaked by his increasing belligerence and inability to drive in a straight line abandons her husband to look for a train station. Meanwhile Antoine strikes up a conversation with a reserved onearmed stranger Vincent Deniard.When minutes later the stranger steps out of the parkinglot shadows his face half hidden by the hood of a sweatshirt and asks for a ride the cocky staggering Antoine doesn't even break stride. By now he's so sweaty and drunk that he waves the fellow right into the car.What follows is detour into a night of terror for Antoine Helene and for the viewer. The movie starts to resemble everyone's nightmare  the inexplicable disappearance of a loved one. And as Antoine embarks on a desperate journey to track his wife down it soon becomes clear that Red Lights is really showing us a portrait of a marriage a marriage that has been enigmatically hanging by a thread.Their need to see the children again is probably just a way of distracting them from the aridness of their relationship. She's beautiful and accomplished while he plain and dull. Somehow the couple began their marriage as equals but she soon eclipsed him for which he can't forgive her. Other than this Kahn provides very little reason as to why their relationship has suddenly gone sour.What Kahn does provide however is the knowledge that marriage can often dissipate completely leave two strangers in a car totally sick of each other in desperate need of a reviving shock to the system. But when the sun finally rises and Antoine is released from his drunken hell Kahn does provide a dash of hope for the couple.In the end Red Lights is showing that relationships are frail and that the machinations of marriage are often inexplicable. And if nothing else Antoine and Helen show that it can all dramatically and irrevocably change and fall apart in a searing flash of red light. Mike Leonard September 05.".

While he says he doesn't drink too often two three times a year he says this night is different. Especially with a fugitive somewhere out on the loose as the radio says.Cedric Kahn is a skilled and trustworthy director via France for a few reasons in dealing with his latest film Red Lights. He doesn't make the pace in the tenser scenes with a couple of juicy exceptions really quick cut like in a choppy Hollywood piece. He brings an interesting blend of visuals with the city and the roads the cars then as it grows darker outside the lights outside become key. When Antoine awakes the next morning on the roadside he's out in the country. As well he has a great blend of music from Debusy whom I may have heard before this film but never recognized. It's a fascinating element to add with the impending doom of the film's story. But the key thing that the director can do for a film is the right casting and here's it's impeccable in dealing with the three leads. JeanPierre Darrousin is terrific at conveying the mindset of this husband in a rocky relationship. Then in the second and third acts despite what he's doing on the road he keeps consistent in keeping as the film's reluctant hero. Credit should also be given to firsttime actor Vincent Deniard who is perfect at being the quiet one you got to watch. And Carole Bouquet is a fair counterpart to a Darrosin. Although the denouement starts to drag for my money the film's main chunk doesn't. It would be one thing if Antoine just got drunk. But there's also a good interest in the talking points with the character as he decides to blow his mind in the process. Red Lights is definitely an arthouse film that won't please everyone the film ends rather realistically without the kind of extra bit American audiences might want that's more intimate here but it's still very compelling.".

Kahn proves himself a specialist on ridiculous men lacking selfconfidence and absolutely inapt to retain some dignity in a modern world like this.The thriller plot as stated by some earlier commentators may be a little weak especially as regards the man on the run he is obviously taken directly from the Simenon novel but his character is neither fish nor foul. But this is not what it is all about. The thriller plot is merely an excuse to give a touching and disturbing portrayal of character Antoine and his marriage.Let me answer to two of the plot holes discovered by two other commentators Antoine's drinking does make sense he drinks because of frustration and a minority complex for not feeling man enough in the presence of his successful wife. His drinking is a childish act of defiance he is not a sensible grownup not a man as he keeps repeating himself. And of course he doesn't recall all these telephone numbers from his memory as indicated with one of the first calls he calls directory inquiries and has himself connected to the respective partner each time remember there is cuts between the various calls.Red Lights is a brilliant character study concealed as a masterpiece of suspense. Darroussin gives a touching performance in his role as hero and antihero at the same time. He is not particularly likable but still makes us feel sorry for him.The ending which I am not going to reveal here is stirring in a very subtle way because above all it raises the question how it is all going to go on.I like stories in which weird things happen out of character logic.

	schema:reviewBody "Red Lights a subtitled French film spends it's 1.75 hour run following Antoine Darroussin and his wife Hlne Bouquet as they leave Paris for a night drive to Bordeaux to pick up their kids. What should have been an ordinary road trip turns into an extraordinary series of events which will leave the couple forever changed. The less you know about these events prior to viewing the better as any hint of what happens could lead to a case of mistaken genre and spoilage. This film is a human drama which doesn't attempt to entertain with extremes but rather opts to engross with a slowly seductive tale of intrigues kept to realistic proportion. Red Lights relies heavily on the ability to identify with the adult married couple and the problems they encounter and therefor will play best with mature adult audiences. A nicely managed methodical and very believable film which spends most of its time with Darroussin Red Lights received good marks from critics and public alike and is well worth a look by mature viewers into French flicks. B".

What should have been an ordinary road trip turns into an extraordinary series of events which will leave the couple forever changed. The less you know about these events prior to viewing the better as any hint of what happens could lead to a case of mistaken genre and spoilage. This film is a human drama which doesn't attempt to entertain with extremes but rather opts to engross with a slowly seductive tale of intrigues kept to realistic proportion. Red Lights relies heavily on the ability to identify with the adult married couple and the problems they encounter and therefor will play best with mature adult audiences. A nicely managed methodical and very believable film which spends most of its time with Darroussin Red Lights received good marks from critics and public alike and is well worth a look by mature viewers into French flicks.

I will say that the acting is incredible JeanPierre Darroussin and Carole Bouquet provide a real tour De force as the main couple. All the incidental characters also make it stick and the film is so artfully filmed in fact everything combines together to make an overall brilliant picture. Perhaps needless to say it is a very psychologically demanding film but absolutely essential viewing. France after a slip in the 80s and early 90s has come back with vengeance in the Cinema stakes and hopefully the rest of the world will sit up and take notice of this Cinema Revolution currently going on! Flawless and truly unmissable.".

What made this incident unique and dramatic is the other factors that came to play  encounters with a dangerous convict on the run by both protagonists and Antoine's indulgence of alcohol resulting in him committing certain outofordinary acts.

Mostly due to Antoine's drinking and Helene's nagging him about it.Almost having an accident Helene becomes more and more concerned about Antonie's ability to drive and insists to go behind the wheel herself. Antoine feeling that it's an insult to his manhood and driving ability staunchly refuses. Stopping in intervals at roadside bars Antoine juices himself up with bottles of beer and shots of whiskey to the point where he misses an exit. This gets him miles off the road to Boaedaux where his and Helene's children are at summer camp.The last straw for Helene is when Antoine again stops at a bar nightclub and gets caught up with the action and drinking. This has Helene walk out on him and take a taxi to the nearest train station for a ride to Bordeaux. It's then when fate takes hold of Antoine and in his hast to find Helene. Antoine finds an escaped murderer and even worse he almost ends up becoming one of his victims.Well directed written and acted French FilmNoir melodrama that has you wondering like Antoine if your dreaming or if whats happening or happened to you is real or not. Antoine is desperate to find Helene and drives all around the Bordeaux area coming up empty in finding Helene. It's later that he get's some information from a local hospital that Helene is a patient there. At the hospital Antoine finds that Helene was found beaten unconscious and alone on a train going to Bordeaux. Antoine doesn't really know if the injured woman is Helene or not until almost the end of the movie. To the complete shock of Antonie and the audience were told that his wife's attacker is a convict who escaped the other night from prison and was later found in the woods dead run over by a car. This bit of startling information brought Antoine back to reality since he thought that what happened to him the night before was all some nightmare that he had while he was dead drunk alone lying in his car.Feux Rouges is a movie that you have to really stay with and not get too irritated with it's very slow pace and lack of dialog. In some scenes the movie goes on for minutes without a word being spoken. The second half of the film where Antonie is out trying to find his wife Helene has the added suspense to what exactly happened to him the evening before. Thats when Helene left him and he ended up in the woods facing death from a desperate escaped convict. We also find out what exactly happened to Antonie and his wouldbe murderer was far more interesting then where she was and what happened to Helene. In the end it what happened to Antonie that evening had a lot more to do with Helene being beaten and hospitalized then even he would have dared to have guessed.".

The last few seconds of the movie show the couple exchanging loving smiles while driving to the South where they would pick the children from a camp to continue together the vacation. Everything goes wrong in the inbetween.'Feux Rouges' starts as a relationship drama and turns into a thriller and a wrongturn movie. It is inspired by a novel of the Georges Simenon and as many of Simenon's novels the characters are far from being great communicators. The lack of communication the routine and maybe the differences in social positions make of Antoine an unhappy husband who is ready to spoil the start of the vacations by heavy drinking while on road. Much of the movie happens on the road and the gradual tension building picking with the disappearance of the wife Helen strikes a cord of uneasiness and even claustrophobia  great achievement for a film filmed on highways and roads with the sky almost permanently on view. As in many of Simenon's novels there is a moralistic twist and justice is made even if it is completely the result of hazard and not of the will of men. And there is a huge price to pay for this justice which we only can guess as it happens out of the screen and story time.Director Cedric Kahn has learned a few lessons in thrillers from the great masters and fist of all from Hitchcock. Antoine is wonderfully played by JeanPierre Darroussin as the type of character that we know from the very first moment that he will get into trouble and he indeed does all to confirm this but it is the character of Helene played by Carole Bouquet that he relates to all the time and who is his focal point of frustration worry and love.The simplicity of the story telling the careful gradation of tension towards horror the low key ending which does not solve the conflict but just postpones it beyond the duration of the screening make of this film a worth watching piece of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Feux rouges is an interesting thriller about a man searching for his wife. The plot turns when he meets a criminal and takes him up with his car on a night trip to Bordeaux. The film is thrilling until the end because you do not know what happens next. The audience is misled by some red herrings that could have been pulled out by Hitchcock. The herrings are no plot holes because the whole film is a dream. It begins with the man sitting in a bar waiting for his wife. Imagine you put this scene at the end of the movie with the man waking up out of a short sleep. It also explains the improbable happy ending and the dreamlike pictures of the night trip.Nevertheless it could have been a better movie. Based on a story by Georges Simeon it lacks of character building. The characters are onesided and not very likable. Underacting is sometimes part of the film noir unfortunately it does not work here.".

	schema:reviewBody "We are all supposed to be shaking in our seats. After all the director of this contrived and artificial piece of nonsense is confident that he has overwhelmed us with shock and horror. The problem is that nothing in the plot is remotely credible. Indeed it is frankly impossible. Carole Bouquet and her husband are driving south from Paris and a convict has escaped from a prison. Husband and wife split up after a quarrel. One takes the train and the other drives. We are expected to believe that out of the sixty million people in France the escaped convict on the same evening encounters only these two separately! He rapes the wife on the train and tries to murder the husband in his car. He does these two things in separate places more or less at the same time. Surely this is carrying surrealism too far. Are we not entitled to the respect of some semblance of rationality in the plot of a film which is supposed to be a 'suspense' film? But it gets worse. The couple are supposed to be driving south to pick up their two children aged 8 and 10 from summer camp. Despite this they quarrel over nothing and the wife abandons the car. As for the husband he has consumed several bottles of whiskey and numerous beers is totally drunk and is driving suicidally. What a way to pick up the kids! What is more astonishing is that we are meant to feel sympathy for the idiotic and irresponsible husband because poor fellow the convict whom he first approaches and then provokes turns on him. What a shame the convict didn't kill the useless twerp. What advanced state of decadence have the French media class entered now when in film after film we are all expected to shed crocodile tears for despicable and loathsome characters? And this film was nominated for a prize at the Berlin Festival! What is going on? Has everybody gone completely raving mad? This film is not worth watching and yet there are plenty of people around praising it. The characters are inhuman and the plot is absurd. Somehow somewhere something very deep is going wrong with filmmakers in France and their critics and festival juries. I called attention to this in my review of 'L'Enfant'. When the wholesome and delightful film 'Amelie' came out a few years ago a chorus of French critics and media folk howled in protest about it and heaped abuse upon it in the press. There is a sickness a deeply serious and growing sickness amongst certain levels of the French media class. All sense of morality has been thrown overboard and a howling intolerance of anything wholesome arises from a baying pack of corrupt and arrogant media insiders. This is all very worrying for those like myself who love French culture and wish it to continue in some form which can continue to command some respect.".

	schema:reviewBody "The French are renowned for intellectualising cinema and identifying it as an area of artistic merit with films such as  Bout de Souffl Belle de Jour and more recently the enchanting Amelie providing examples of the pinnacle of film making. Expectations can be high as they were with Feux Rouges and it can be easy to be disappointed.The narrative follows a married couple's journey to pick up their two children from summer camp. Helene Carole Bouquet is beautiful and intelligent and is a hit at the law firm where she works but her husband Antoine Jean Pierre Darroussin is less successful and attractive leaving him with feelings of impotency which he deals with by drinking. This offering from our Gallic neighbours has left me with a desire to sign the petition to fill in the channel tunnel immediately. I have been violently offended by this film. I consider myself a modern man unthreatened by powerful women I have a willingness to talk about my emotions I even shed a tear at the end of Titanic. But when confronted with a drink driving caveman that harbours a desire to beat his chest and reinstate some prehistoric superiority over his wife I can only be insultedThe insult is not the fault of the cast Darroussin's enchanting performance is particularly impressive perfectly portraying the levels of inebriation at times humorous always pitiful. It is not his drinking that annoys as Dudley Moores Arthur and Richard E Grants Withinail show drunks can be hilarious. It is the response of those around the drunk that are both bewildering and frustrating. Bars next to the motorway continue to serve the drunken Antoine and he coasts through a police roadblock with ease. The night time cinematography is surreal and beautiful perfectly expressing the hypnotic quality of road markings and headlights that can easily enthral the unwary driver. This is heightened by a fairy tale quality that is given to some of the nocturnal motorway encounters. The director does manage to build up tension and the first half of the film is gripping as we search for the answers for Antoine's drinking and sympathise with his plight as he is continuously kept waiting by his wife. Their relationship is interesting at this stage primarily because we are intrigued why Helene has settled for the unhappy and unpleasant Antoine. Unfortunately the film deteriorates quickly from then on never knowing quite what it wants to say. The only message that does come through clearly is a rather unpleasant one regarding equality between the sexes in a contemporary world. Antoine's journey is one of discovery as he searches for his identity as a man. This is emphasised by his disregard for authority by speeding and drink driving causing his wife to get the train. His attempts to bond with other men and his rants about brotherhood seem laughable but also dangerous as shown in the tense scene in which he picks up a hitchhiker. The film continues to irritate when Antoine realises that the hitchhiker is a wanted killer but looks up to him because he is a real man and does not bow down to anyone. By allowing Antoine to kill this murderer in self defence the audience is told that it is in combat that men become real men in this case Antoine regains his masculine power. He becomes the warrior. Helene is still strong though and in order to put her back in her place and to restore Antoine's masculinity fully Helene has to be stripped of her power by the last weapon of degradation that man has against woman. The rape revelation allows Antoine to return to his shattered and broken spouse and be a pillar of strength taking his rightful place as master of the household and removing any guilt he would feel at taking another mans life as he can view it as revenge for the violation of his wife.Is this a comment on the modern man? Are we still in an age in which men are so threatened by equality that was want to revert to some archaic time where the phallus rules over all?The cinematography is impressive in parts the characters are believable and there are moments of genuine humour but it is uneven with plot holes and distracting suggestions about infidelity and conspiracy theories. As a literary adaptation it suffers from the lack of a strong captain at the helm who also appears to have been intimidated by the source material. It lacks clarity of storytelling and bumbles between a cinematic experience and the representation of a literary one. Feux Rouges remains an immensely irritating film that portrays a man that has no place in today's society.".

Hollywood likes to pitch a regular sort of guy into a baffling situation over which he has no control  Denzil Washington up against shadowy State operatives or Harrison Ford against various bad guys for example. The pace is fast and there is tension followed by a letup at frequent intervals. We the audience identify with the protagonist and cheer for him or her to succeed. In this film there is a central character called Antoine who is stupid beyond belief  Homer Simpson is a philosopher by comparison  and who gets himself into a nasty but routine situation he could have easily avoided if giving a lift to an escaped psychopath is routine. Then he blunders his way out of it. We sigh with relief at the end as he avoids a fate he richly deserves. Funnily enough he is almost sympathetic for his one concern is the safety of his family  he might be thick but like Homer his heart's in the right place.There's plenty of tension though built up in a different way. The camera spends a lot of time on closeups especially on JeanPierre Darroussin of Marseilles movies fame who plays Antoine. An air of menace is generated by car radio bulletins heavy nighttime road traffic seamy roadside dives and Antoine's increasing intake of alcohol which reaches almost incredible proportions. Most of the time is spent on busy French roads at and we spend a lot of time waiting for the inevitable crash.JeanPierre Darroussin turns in a remarkable performance. He is a sort of French everyman an insurance company clerk married to a much more highpowered woman who is a corporate lawyer Carole Bouquet  gorgeous as always. You wonder how they ever got together. Yet Darrousin somehow convinces us that the fate of this little man matters to her as well as to us.The original property apparently was a story by the prolific French writer Georges Simenon of 'Maigret' fame and the interrogation of Antoine by an extraordinarily wellbriefed police officer is straight out of a Maigret episode. I would think the story has been updated a bit career woman attorneys were pretty unusual in Maigret's day. I can't really think that the police would assume so readily that Antoine was not guilty of any crime  police officers are known more for their pedantry than imagination but at least it helps the plot towards resolution.You won't like this movie if you don't like French films but it is a vivid and absorbing entertainment albeit about someone we pity rather than admire. It has not encouraged me to any do more driving in France even in an apparently indestructible Rover.".
