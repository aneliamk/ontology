The production of food overall has more drastically changed since that time than the several thousand years prior. Controlled primarily by a handful of multinational corporations the global food production business  with an emphasis on the business  has as its unwritten goals production of large quantities of food at low direct inputs most often subsidized resulting in enormous profits which in turn results in greater control of the global supply of food sources within these few companies. Health and safety of the food itself of the animals produced themselves of the workers on the assembly lines and of the consumers actually eating the food are often overlooked by the companies and are often overlooked by government in an effort to provide cheap food regardless of these negative consequences.

	schema:reviewBody "The message of 'Food Inc.' is that most of what Americans now eat is produced by a handful of highly centralized megabusinessesand that this situation is detrimental to health environment even our very humanity. The ugly facts of animal mistreatment food contamination and government collusion are covered up by a secretive industry that wouldn't talk to the filmmakers or let the interiors of their chicken farms cattle ranches slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants be filmed.Informed by the voices and outlook of bestseller authors Eric Schlosser 'Fast Food Nation' and Michael Pollen 'The Omnivore's Dilemma' this new film is an expos that offers some hope that things can be made better through grassroots efforts. True Kenner points out Monsanto Smithfield Perdue et al. are rich and powerful. But so were the tobacco companies and if Philip Morris and Reynolds could be fought successfully so can the food industry. The fact that the vast Walmart is switching to organic foods because customers want them shows people vote effectively with their pocketbooks every time they buy a meal.Other documentaries have covered this ground before. The 2008 French documentary 'The World According to Monsanto' 2008 focused on how that company with government support monopolizes seed planting and Deborah Koons' 2004 'The Future of Food' went over similar ground. Jennifer Abbott and Mark Achbar's sweeping 2003 film 'The Corporation' 2003 touched on Monsanto's monopoly too. In more general terms the ominous narrationfree German documentary 'Our Daily Bread' Nikolaus Geyrhalter 2003 delivered 'Food Inc.'s' message about dehumanized factorystyle food production with a European focus. Richard Linklater's 2006 'Fast Food Nation' grew out of Schlosser's book about how bad and disgusting American fast food is and how it undermines the health. These are all good films and there are and will be lots more. As this new film mentions exploitation and malpractice in the meat industry were exposed as far back as Upton Sinclair's 1906 muckraking book 'The Jungle.''Food Inc.' is a populist and practical film that speaks with the voices of farmers advocates and journalists and focuses on food what's wrong with it and what we can do about it. Kenner offers lots of practical information and appeals to everyday people. The film goes back to the Fifties to show how the rise of fast food contributed to centralized less diverse American food production. MacDonald's now much of the chicken beef potatoes and many other foods produced in the country. The film explains that only a handful of companies control not only most of the beef pork chicken and corn produced in the US but most other food products as well. Moreover not only is corn the major feed given to food animals but a surprising amount of the tens of thousands of products sold at today's supermarket  that packaged junk racked in the center of the store that Atkins and now Pollen have told us to avoid are also derived from corn. Because of the way certain food products have government support hamburgers are cheaper than fresh vegetables. Kenner focuses on a lowincome Orozcos who both work and feel forced to rely on fast food meals because they fill them and their kids more economically than fresh produce bought at the market.The new industry has developed chickens that grow bigger faster with more breast meat. They're kept in closed dark pens. The story is the same for all these poor mass produced critters crammed together in great numbers filled with antibiotics deformed suffering ankle deep in their own excrement brutally killed. The film has good footage of the big southern meat producer Smithfield showing how the new megafood industry feeds off of exploited lowwage illegal immigrants who it treats as expendable just like the animals.An important spokesman in 'Food Inc.' is an organic farmer you could just say a stubbornly oldfashioned one called Joel Salatin of Polyface Farm in Swoope Virginia who's also an author though the movie doesn't mention his books. His cattle are grassfed and watching them we realize that's the way nature meant them to be. They roams free living a healthy life trimming back the grass while fertilizing it so it will grow back. Cattle weren't meant to live on corn and doing so has led to infection. The industry solution to such problems is not to change back to earlier methods but to add more chemicals. They're doing crazy things like adding bleach to hamburger filler to keep the burgers from being poison.It's hard to keep a balance in such a documentary but Kenner tries. That Hispanic family is important. Slow food and organics have been a thing of the rich as their dilemma illustrates. There could be more focus on everyday people and their difficult daily choices. The Walmart story is important too Walmart customers are everyday people. It's easy enough for well heeled families to buy boutique produce at farmer's markets. Average Joes don't always have the time or the money for that. Also important is Barbara Kowalcyk who works in Washington with her mother as an advocate for stricter laws. Her 2 12yearold son Kevin died in 12 days from a virulent form of E. coli after eating a hamburger on vacation. She wants not sympathy but control of an indifferent industry. Carole Morison is another vivid voice she is a southern chicken farmer who lost her contract with Perdue for refusing to switch to dark enclosed tunnel chicken coops the latest in a series of enforced improvements that lead to more production at the cost of more cruelty. She also explains how the farmers in thrall to these big companies are kept in debt like indentured servants. Armed with witty clear graphics and ironically bright color 'Food Inc.' has a chance of gaining more converts to slow organic local food and opponents to crooked food regulation and monopolistic industry. This seems one of the most balanced and humane treatments of the subject yet.".

	schema:headline " Mustsee documentary for anyone who eats";
	schema:reviewBody "It is said that if you like eating sausage you better not see how it is made. If you like eating meat don't watch an animal being killed. If you have your fill of fruits and vegetables daily don't think about the pesticides that coat them.Our modern society has sanitized the presentation of food so that we can blissfully ignore what we should be concerned with where food comes from how it is raised picked handled altered transported and sold. Instead our attention is focused only on the awesome number of beautiful packages on market shelves the unblemished fruits and vegetables available year round. In our increasingly artificial world appearance trumps taste price trumps provenance and industrialization gives us a false sense of safety.It is therefore opportune to have the release of Food Inc. After you see it you'll probably not shop for food in the same way. You may even change the kinds of food you eat. Not enough to convince me to become a vegetarian but the ubiquitousness of corn and its derivatives stated multiple times in the film has made scouring of package labels a routine. The easy rule of not buying anything that contains more than five ingredients more frequently obeyed.The film contains material that has already been brought out by others for examples 1 the problem of genetically modified seeds crossing into properties that do not want them and 2 the appalling conditions in which farm animals are kept. Some material is stressed too much for example the whole issue surrounding the tragic death of a kid from a very virulent form of E.coli and the attempts to establish regulations that might prevent such deaths. Individual cases are worth mentioning but systemic and widespread issues are more compelling. The death of one is no doubt a tragedy but the impairment of thousands is of greater social consequence.The issue of food regulation in general is a subject that I would have liked to see more of. The adverse effect of more regulation as per the example above can be too much regulation. The subject is briefly broached by the good farmer Joel Salatin who kills his chickens in the open. Ironically those chickens are likely to be more healthy and tasty. Regulation may eliminate this practice. Regulation can therefore have a negative impact on food culture. One of the best example of this is preventing the importation into the US of many delicious young unpasteurized cheese from Europe or even the marketing of such cheese by US producers. How many get sick from those cheese compared to the number of sick from peanut butter or spinach?The film unwittingly projects a bit of naivet in a couple of places. The segment about an individual being sued by a food conglomerate and essentially losing for lack of money is not news. This is a capitalist system more money better lawyers almost certain victory. Yet the point is well taken that the food conglomerates are behaving in thuggish ways and acting with the protection of a complicit government the best money can buy. But again uncontrolled capitalism generates monopolies and they will fight tooth and nail to retain control and squash any semblance of competition. It's the logic of the beast. This not limited to food. Since voting habits have brought the US to this state of affairs our only recourse as consumers is to eat bananas and only bananas for breakfast lunch and dinner. It's called the Chiquita Diet.In any case this is a mustsee documentary. The director is to be commended for having the courage of tackling this very important topic.Don't forget to buy a five gallon basket of popcorn dripping with oleo and a big soda with plenty of high fructose corn syrup before going into the screening room. It may be the last time you do.".

It's called the Chiquita Diet.In any case this is a mustsee documentary. The director is to be commended for having the courage of tackling this very important topic.Don't forget to buy a five gallon basket of popcorn dripping with oleo and a big soda with plenty of high fructose corn syrup before going into the screening room. It may be the last time you do.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that foodborne diseases cause approximately 76 million illnesses 325000 hospitalizations and 5000 deaths in the United States each year. If you are the mother of twoyearold Kevin Kowalcyk who died in 2001 after eating a hamburger contaminated with E. Coli however statistics do not tell the story of crushing personal loss. The tragedy of Kevin's premature death spurred legislation known as Kevin's Law introduced by Rep. Anna G. Eshoo DPalo Alto that would give the U.S. Department of Agriculture the power to close down plants that produce contaminated meat but it has failed repeatedly to pass the U.S. Congress because of opposition from the meat industry. EColi outbreaks and other foodsafety related issues are discussed in the outstanding documentary Food Inc. directed by Robert Kenner a film graphic in part that may leave you with a severe case of indigestion. Kenner is an unabashed advocate for greater food safety and the film with commentary by Eric Schlosser Fast Food Nation and Michael Pollan The Omnivore's Dilemma.attempts to convince the public of the shortsightedness of the megacorporations that dominate the food industry and their faster fatter bigger cheaper method of increasing profits often at the expense of public safety. Representatives from foodproducing giants such as Monsanto Smithfield Tyson and Perdue that control our food supply were invited to be interviewed for the film but declined or did not respond to Kenner's request. According to Schlosser The industry doesn't want you to know the truth about what you're eating  because if you knew you might not want to eat it. Interviewing farmers and ranchers Kenner learned that they are mostly at the mercy of megacorporations like Monsanto which have increased their share of the soybean market from 2 to 90 in the last decade. Monsanto developed their own custom gene for soybeans and now threaten their customers with lawsuits for patent infringement if they save their own seeds to use the next year. The film observes that part of the reason why the food industry is so hard to regulate is that many of the government officials currently assigned to watchdog roles were once employed by the companies they now monitor and notes that FDA food inspections have plummeted from 50000 in 1972 to 9200 in 2006. Other subjects covered are the treatment of cows that are forced to eat corn instead of grass which then goes into Coke high fructose corn syrup diapers decongestants and batteries and the dreadful conditions of chickens that are herded into darkened cages before they are slaughtered. On that subject Kenner interviews Carole Morrison who was unwilling to jam her chickens into cages without sunlight and as a result had her contract canceled by a giant chicken conglomerate who refused to have any further business dealings with her. Also discussed are the growing rates of diabetes in young people the soaring incidence of obesity and the use of low paying illegal immigrants to work in the food processing industry.In spite of the horror stories however Food Inc. is not depressing and Kenner seems more interested in educating the public than frightening them. He shows that people can make a difference by citing the tobacco industry as well as the efforts of an entrepreneur from Stonyfield Farms who sold his line of organic products to WalMart and a Virginia farmer who insists on raising animals with dignity and respect. To the strain of Bruce Springsteen singing Woody Guthrie's This Land is Your Land advice on how individuals can make a difference include  buy locally shop in farmer's markets where possible seek out quality and organic products even if they cost a bit more and be sure to read the labeling to learn where a product comes from and the ingredients it contains. Food Inc. by itself may not be the catalyst that will preserve our health and well being and make food taste the way it did fifty years ago but it is an important start and should be seen by anyone who eats that means all of us. As the director puts it I think we're beginning to see the dangers of this inexpensive food that these big agribusinesses are producing. And the more we can see the cracks in this system the faster it's going to fall apart. I'm hoping that this film can help people to start to think about itPeople are becoming much more conscious of their food and the more we think about it the more good food we're going to get. I'll vote for that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Food Inc is essential viewing even though it's not a great movie. Much like An Inconvenient Truth its facts and accumulation of information trumps style or overall craft. This doesn't mean that the director isn't making a bad film or doesn't have some clever visual cues and transitions or know how to combine interviews and archival footage since he does. But it's the precious interviews he gets and just leaving the theater knowing that American food or just stretching worldwide is run by four corporations and that the farming industry as is advertised as the American Farmer is in deep trouble.It's separated into sections and each one has something interesting. The one that got to me personally was the section on chickens how they like cows as well are genetically engineered to get bigger a lot faster than they used to and how the working conditions are at best hazardous and at worst untenable. We see one woman interviewed the only one who bucked her corporate bosses to let the cameras in to the state of the chicken coop. Even if one hasn't seen a regular chicken coop before the state of this place the stark and dark misenscene gives us a picture of how it is. As someone like myself who likes a good piece of chicken every now and again it made me about as guilty as imaginable.But perhaps that's part of the point of Food Inc  get us informed to the point where we're scared sless. The downside may be the reach while Inconvenient Truth had the boost of a Vice President the big names in this documentary are authors one of which wrote Fast Food Nation and surprisingly eats a hamburger on camera from a diner of course and speaks about how burger and fries are some of his favorite food to eat despite the horrors of the fast food industry. So it's difficult to say how many people will see this who don't already have some idea about the atrocious conditions in slaughterhouses the outbreaks of EColi that affect countless people including little Kevin as seen in the film and Monsanto's patent of a soybean seed that they genetically altered. Between that last part alone and a little factoid made about Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas it's no wonder one leaves the theater flabbergasted.There is some hope the film provides however. A Virginia farmer who treats all of his livestock with care and feeds them right not copious amounts of CORN which by the way is practically coming out of your ears as you read this gives a few moments to reflect on how the ideal of the American farmer of what they can give to the community and how they can try and be reasonable with having to do the inevitable of killing living things for food. Hell the director even has WalMart's one really good moment in the documentary sun in years with its endorsement of organic products. But whatever you're own persuasion on food be you a hardcore vegan or someone just coming from McDonalds before the movie starts Food Inc can make some sort of difference if only for the information. I know I may not stop eating certain foods but I'll never forget to give another look or a double take on what's in it or what may not be there at all. This movie is good valuable stuff.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Food Inc.";
	schema:reviewBody "I recall a story where a teacher had tasked her students to draw a picture of a chicken for art class and to her surprise one of them drew a chicken fillet. I suppose the point here is that we've become so detached from the origins of our food sources save for the form they take when already in the supermarkets cured and prepared with ready to cookeat processes becoming the norm of our daily lives. And with periodic cases of food scares and poisoning this film takes a look throughout the food chain of today and although it's rather UScentric it still has plenty of relevance here since after all we import almost everything.With technological research applied to our food sources be it the humble grain or to the meat to satisfy all us omnivores out there the drive of course is to produce enough to feed all the mouths although sometimes things get done out necessity and spiral out of control when the pressure's there to produce food that can grow faster fatter and to shorten the time it takes to get to the dining table.Directed by Robert Kenner this is a documentary that followed some of the points that you would have become familiar with in films like Fast Food Nation whose writer also provided an interview and laid the foundations of our predicament quite squarely on the MacDonald brothers who had revolutionized the way food gets prepared presented and sourced. Kenner cleverly sections the film into digestible chunks each focused on aspects of the food chain and the products themselves. The stark images and footage on how animals are treated as products in an assembly line subjected to the mass production killing process will definitely shock you into thinking  that cannot be right nor humane. Will it make you swear off meat? Probably.In fact the picture got painted in very bleak terms where food conglomerates continue to grow in size and profits resulting in the power they have over consumers politicians and the likes where choice and options are but a facade on shelves because the brands and products all belong to common parents. Corporations exists for profits and are not responsible for consequences arising from their drive to make money. Everything else that resulted from that drive whether or not a negative impact on society and human lives can be considered collateral in their goal to feed the earth and profit from it. Naturally none of the conglomerate representatives wanted to be interviewed for the film and that comes with no surprise especially when their underhanded tactics in dealing with opposition and corrupt practices get exposed through hidden cameras.And in some ways the film too makes you feel a little guilty for being part of the fuel on the demand side of things. With demand comes the opportunity to supply and make money and corporate social responsibility is still something relatively new as a buzzword that has plenty of room to be translated into action.But the film is not all noise in complaining and presenting a doomsday scenario and that's where the film earned merits in providing workable alternative solutions rather than just barking up a tree. It balanced the issues on what we could do and engages the audience to be catalyst for change making one realize that one has the power to skew demand to more acceptable methods of production rather than one bred on convenience. It's not all serious nature here as Kenner does inject enough wellplaced humour into the documentary so that it doesn't come off as too heavyhanded in treatment in pointing the loaded guns of blame onto others.Food Inc. is an incredible documentary about where our food comes from and for those without an inkling of knowledge it would be worthwhile to sit through this film and get some enlightenment. More importantly of course is to take action to prevent our stomachs from becoming just repositories for Salt Fat and Sugar. Highly Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "With family run farms pretty much a thing of the past institutional farming has pretty much taken overand the dimdark  dismal effects are omnipresent. There is an epidemic of food borne illnessdue to cattle being exposed to over use of steroids to make them grow fatter faster and this also includes chickenspigsetc.not to mention GMO corngrainsetc. Robert Kenner's eye opening film 'FoodInc.' manages to shine at least some light on some pretty unethical practices that are being undertaken by corporate owned  managed farms. The likes of Eric Schlosser author of 'Fast Food Nation'which was made into a semi fictional film a few years backis featured in interviewsalong with Michael Pollan. Many fingers are pointed at guilty parties doing the dirty deeds of the farming industryalong with some pretty unpleasant footage of unethical practices i.e. abuse of farm animals although this film doesn't take up any kind of vegetarianvegan agenda of it's ownthe viewer can make up their own mind just what they prefer to eat. Much to my surprisethere is little discussion of the mad cow disease epidemic orBSEfrom a few years back only a passing reference. Rated PG by the MPAAthis film contains some unpleasant footage of animal abuseas well as a rude wordor two. Okay for older children who care about what's on their plate for breakfastlunch or dinner.".

	onyx:emotionText "With family run farms pretty much a thing of the past institutional farming has pretty much taken overand the dimdark  dismal effects are omnipresent. There is an epidemic of food borne illnessdue to cattle being exposed to over use of steroids to make them grow fatter faster and this also includes chickenspigsetc.not to mention GMO corngrainsetc. Robert Kenner's eye opening film 'FoodInc.' manages to shine at least some light on some pretty unethical practices that are being undertaken by corporate owned  managed farms. The likes of Eric Schlosser author of 'Fast Food Nation'which was made into a semi fictional film a few years backis featured in interviewsalong with Michael Pollan. Many fingers are pointed at guilty parties doing the dirty deeds of the farming industryalong with some pretty unpleasant footage of unethical practices i.e. abuse of farm animals although this film doesn't take up any kind of vegetarianvegan agenda of it's ownthe viewer can make up their own mind just what they prefer to eat. Much to my surprisethere is little discussion of the mad cow disease epidemic orBSEfrom a few years back only a passing reference. Rated PG by the MPAAthis film contains some unpleasant footage of animal abuseas well as a rude wordor two. Okay for older children who care about what's on their plate for breakfastlunch or dinner.";

	schema:reviewBody "If there is any truth to the saying you are what you eat then the USA is in big trouble. You don't have to be a doctor farmer or a nutritionist to see that way too many Americans are fat.Not big boned.Not with glandular problems.Not with genetic predispositions.Just fat plain and simple.But like trying to buy clothing that has no connection to Asian sweatshops or any product not directly connected to oil finding wholesome foods that are delicious and nutritious is difficult.After seeing the documentary Food Inc. if you are planning to go to dinner you may find your appetite suppressed or at the very least you will reconsider your choice of restaurants.Food Inc. from writerdirector Robert Kenner is a documentary that looks at the huge corporate run food industry and how through a series of small not even necessarily conscious steps they have become purveyors of cheap food that is no longer wholesome nutritious or even tasty and how the big food corporations are now making more money than they ever have before at any time.But the real price is paid by us the consumers. We pay for it in a significantly greater risk of food borne illness and in generally poor health from crappy products that are way too high in fat sugar and salt.Now anyone familiar with Eric Schlosser's book Fast Food Nation or Michael Pollan's book The Omnivore's Dilemma is already familiar with many of the arguments put forth in Food Inc. Both Eric Schlosser and to a larger extent Michael Pollan were consultants on the making of this film and they appear in on screen interviews as well but reading about the unsanitary conditions chickens are raised in is one thing actually seeing them is another.Food Inc. makes the point that if you only look at the picture labels of food items in the supermarket and take them at face value you would think that your bread meat cereals and dairy products are all made on small farms by happy wholesome farmers.Food Inc. shatters that delusion absolutely completely and totally. Unless you actually buy your food from a farmer directly at his farm or roadside stand you are getting overprocessed crap from huge conglomerates who make more money now than at any time in American history yet they are providing us consumers with more crap literally in many cases than at any other time.The big food conglomerates all say that the public have irrational ideas about where their food comes from and that's why they don't want anyone to see how they actually raise the crops and animals that feed us and they are right. If people saw the truth about where what they were putting into their mouths came from there would be riots.Food Inc. tries to show us that truth and it is hard to swallow even though director Kenner presents his material in a calm and straightforward manner.I was particularly disturbed by a sequence where a meat processing company in order to cut down on EColi bacteria in their product mixed their meat with another product that was simply ground beef and bleach yes bleach combined with beef to kill the bacteria.This made more sense to the food company than finding a way to cut down on the amount of cow feces mixed into the beef to begin with. Something is definitely wrong when my hamburger has to be mixed with Clorox to be safe.Contrary to what the food conglomerates think there is no mental disconnect between the public knowing that the cows and chickens raised on farms for food are going to be killed but no reasonable person wants to see any individual animals suffer unnecessarily.Seeing these big food conglomerates penning up animals hoof deep in their own excrement chickens packed to the point of suffocation and force fed vitamins and antibiotics to make them grow abnormally fast and large and don't even think about the pigs they seem to get the worst treatment of all.In the case of beef it is almost a complete monopsony. Since McDonald's is probably the single largest purchaser of beef in the USA maybe the world as the single buyer they pretty much have control of the market. Therefore they can demand that anyone who sells them beef conform to their standards for meat.What's good about this is it makes for a uniform product.What's bad about this is it makes for a uniformly bad product.This is why a Big Mac tastes exactly the same in California as it does in New Jersey. I for one don't think that's a positive outcome.But Food Inc. is not just a lecture on the horrors in hamburger. The film actually provides you with some options on better eating that are easy to follow and can make you feel empowered. We don't have to be passive consumers there are things we as individuals can do to make sure we get the good food we deserve.But there are some moments in Food Inc. that are truly sickening and I don't mean the shots of sick downer cows being ground up into Big Mac meat or the deformed chickens who can't even stand because of their unnaturally large breasts no the moments that are the most sickening come from the all too human food industry Public Relations douche bags.Hearing their convoluted doubletalk about how the conglomerates well funded attempts to fight having to label where their food products actually come from or whether they have been irradiated or have been genetically modified and how all of this is really just the food companies fighting for your right as a consumer to choose is more nauseating than a mouthful of fecal contaminated cow slurry.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I got back home from watching the utterly depressing documentary Food Inc. I booted up my computer to check my email and the first headline I saw on the news site I use as my homepage was a report on an outbreak of E. coli. The bacteria were apparently found in a sample of that vital staple of the modern American diet chilled cookie dough. At that point some dozen or so people were sick. I'm not sure which type of E. coli this report referred to specifically but it seems there is a modern type of E. coli which causes internal bleeding in its victims is often fatal and apparently didn't exist until we started pumping cattle full of corn instead of grass or hay to fatten them up faster. One of the film's most compelling 'stars' was a mother whose toddler died of E. coli infection after eating some hamburgers.To be honest Food Inc. didn't really tell me anything I didn't know already which is why I didn't give it 10. Meat production is no longer about happy smiling farmers chewing on straws beside their plump warmbodied cows in sun filled grassy fields. Or even about Marlboro smoking cowboys riding the range on trusty steeds to round up stray mavericks while the sun sets over the western horizon. It's about feces encrusted cattle jammed cheek by jowl into manure filled feed lots mile after mile after smelly mile while we pump them full of subsidized corn growth hormones and antibiotics and process them like so many slabs of raw industrial protein. And when we do process them a job usually carried out by cheap immigrant labor because none of us squeamish meat eaters want to do the job the manure randomly falls off the cattle's hides and onto the meat where it festers until we cook it  or fail to cook it  and eat it. But don't worry soon we may have a way to make sure no nasty bacteria remain on the meat.we're going to wash it all with another chemical to kill the bugs  I forgetbut was that REALLY caustic soda  sodium hydroxide?  Lovely eh? Food Inc. doesn't just look at beef production although that's probably the most compelling part of the film because watching a mother try to recover from the deathbyfoodpoisoning of her toddler by turning into Erin Brokovich and taking on the might of the food industry AND the government is fairly riveting stuff. Food Inc. also looks at the chicken industry GMO soy beans and the ludicrous subsidies that have made nutritionally poor fast food far far cheaper than anything remotely healthy. Like fruit and veg whole grains or humanely produced meat. And not only that the subsidies have underwritten the cost of grain exports via NAFTA to the extent that producers in developing countries can no longer compete in their home markets putting farmers in places like Mexico out of work. So what do they do? They migrate  often illegally  to the USA to work in meat processing plants.And if you are a farmer trying to grow non GMO soy beans  or any crop really  please don't be silly enough to do it anywhere downwind of a GMO field because if stray pollen happens to land in your field and the mighty seed company finds evidence of their genes on your patch of ground boy are you in trouble. Quite how you keep your crop GMO free under these circumstances is beyond me. But should anyone out there want non GMO food  well we can always import it from another country. And we do. Meanwhile Big Seed is putting out of business a centuries old small industrial practice that helps farmers save seed from year to year. If this were happening overseas we would call it fascism.And in this manner following individual cases Michael Pollan author of the excellent Omnivore's Dilemma and maker of Fast Food Nation Eric Schlosser show us how food production has strayed from being about producing well food and has become a huge industrial operation controlled by a frighteningly small number of big businesses. Never mind Eisenhower's 1961 warning about the Military Industrial Complex. Why did no one warn us about the Agricultural Industrial Complex? The European Union's past obsession with industrializing food production is at least understandable given the horrendous WW2 shortages which led to rationing which continued for years after the war. But when did America ever have rationing? Truly a frightening and depressing movie. I'm a lucky middle class person. I have a garden where I grow veggies and I can afford to buy organic eggs and meat. I know not everyone can. But there must be some way to break this ludicrous vicious circle. When we see the people who are now existing on fast food use money they could  and should  be spending on fruit and veg to instead pay for their prescription drugs to treat the diseases they get  from eating fast food  something snaps in my head and I wonder if the whole world is totally and utterly bonkers? And on it goes.But as the small scale organic farmer said as he processed some home grown chickens and pigs through his family run business where people come to buy genuinely farm raised grass fed meat after a 3 or 4 hour drive Don't say you can't afford 3 a dozen for organic eggs when you're standing there with a 75c can of coke in your hands.. Exactly. Eat less  mostly greens as Michael Pollan approximately says.".

	schema:headline " Brilliant expos of food industry coverup";
	schema:reviewBody "Food Inc. is the new brilliant documentary which should shock all Americans about what has become of our food supply. It begins with the camera slowly panning through a supermarket focusing on row after row of sanitized food products. The point is made that there are only a few multinational corporations who actually produce the vast majority of food products seen on our supermarket shelves today. They seek to lull a complacent public into believing that the food we eat is wholesome and is produced in the simple spirit of our agrarian forefathers. Of course we soon see that their marketing seeks to cover up a much more sinister reality.Food Inc. first focuses on chicken production. The filmmakers got a hold of one chicken producer who raises chickens for Tyson Foods perhaps the largest poultry provider in the country. The chicken producer was more than willing to show his behindthe scenesoperation until he was told by Tyson to shut up. It's obvious they didn't want him to show how the chickens were raisedthousands of them shut up in a building devoid of sunlight and being fed with cheap corn products to fatten them up. Today's chickens were contrasted with the chickens of yesteryear and today they are twice the size. They were able to interview a woman who raised chickens for Perdue. She apparently was fed up and refused to go along with Perdue's directives to raise her chickens using mass production techniques. But even with her more humane efforts many of her chickens were dying due to antibiotic resistance. The woman herself indicated that she had developed health problems as a result of contact with these antibiotics. One of the film's revelations I wasn't aware of was that these small businessmen are at the mercy of the conglomerates and if they don't do what they say they'll be put out of business.Another segment involves a food safety crusader who lost her three year old to E Coli contamination after eating a tainted hamburger. She sponsors Kevin's Law named after her fallen son but gets little support in Congress due to the lobbying efforts of the food industry who have prevented passage of the bill.More shocking revelations abound including an extended segment on just how pervasive corn has not only been utilized as a cheap source of food for livestock leading to the proliferation of manure that gets into our food supply but also how it's used to create new processed food with little nutritional value. We also meet a lower middleclass Hispanic family who can't avoid eating fast food even though they're aware how unhealthy it is for them. The father is suffering from early onset Diabetes which is becoming one of the fastest growing health problems linked to eating unhealthy meals of processed food. The family not only doesn't have the time to shop for better foods but they don't have the moneyso they end up going to McDonald's instead.Immigrant workers are also exploited by the multinationals who used to recruit farmers in Mexico who could no longer compete against the big food producers in the U.S. They shipped the workers here in droves where they're now economically dependent on these corporations despite working in horribly unsanitary conditions. Now with antiimmigrant sentiment running wild a few token workers are rounded up everyday to appease the public and the corporations are never charged with hiring illegal help.The most shocking information we learn is the role of Monsanto Corporation monopolizing the soybean market. As a result of a Supreme Court decision Monsanto now holds a 'patent' on their genetically modified soybean. They've ended up destroying the careers of small farmers by suing them for violation of their patents Monsanto's soybean ends up as part of the farmers' crop so they're accused of infringement. What's worse is the long line of government officials former Monstanto employees who are now and have been in the highest positions in the Food and Drug Administration responsible for food safety oversight. Ten years ago there were 50000 food safety inspections a yearlast year the FDA only authorized 9000. And these officials weren't only appointed during the Bush administration. President Clinton also had a healthy share of these former Monsantoites working at the FDA.While Monsanto is clearly the biggest villain among many Food Inc. attempts to highlight more productive people in the 'system'. One interview focuses on an organic livestock producer who feeds his cattle grass and not corn. While it's clear he treats his livestock better than the conglomerates I'm not a believer in the idea of 'compassionate slaughter'. Why eat meat at all? There's also an interview with the president of Stonyfield Farms famous for organic yogurt. He ended up selling out to Walmart but he feels it was a good thing since 'better' products were made available to the public on a mass scale. Again the sale of any kind of dairy products organic or not is not a good thing in the long run for one's health. Food Inc. attempts to end on an optimistic note. It's up to the consumer to choose more healthy food. The example of successful consumer action is cited in the case of the tobacco industry which was brought down after the public woke up to the deleterious effects of its products. Until the public is willing to look behind the veil of unhealthy food production in this country they will continue to enjoy bad meals at McDonald's and other nefarious 'restaurants'. Food Inc. is one of those rare documentaries which can open peoples' eyesand that's not easy to do!".

Variety is the key.We wanted to watch the movie however were scared as a lot of people I'm sure that we'd never want to eat meat again. It actually didn't do that at all. What it's changed is where we buy meat and who we choose to support. Regarding the corn situation it's always been a concern due to corn intolerance in some of us.

However after watching this doc Food Inc. you will think a little bit more about what your eating the next time as this film shows the wicked process that many foods go thru before they reach your mouth. Most chilling is how the industry is controlled by corporations who are more interested in profit and making money than people's health.Starting off it shows and even interviews many chicken farmers who tell the horrifying tales of how chickens are hit and injected with steroid to be made bigger and fatter before slaughter so that it's more tasty and fatter when it hits the plate of a hungry mate. Also interesting and yet gross is how cows are shot up with hormones and then given the ever popular and tasty corn syrup before they are butchered. This all happens before they are processed to meat which due to the injections and chemical infections causes cases of death and other food sickness from being poisoned to catching diseases. Most disturbing is the words from a mother who lost a young son after he eat three hamburgers and became infected with death.Still you see during the film it's an on going fight with the food industry as it's powerful and very cunning for the very way that they fight traditional farmers by making them use their own corporate chemical seed. As one farmer is nearly bankrupt in his lawsuit against a company as he tries to save his own plantings of original seed. And still as many fight and lobby congress many from the food giant companies are lobbyist and heads of committees and with their interactions with politicians always bills are passed in favor for the food companies.Too the industry is clever as it's use of corn syrup in everything makes for the need to make those products more cheap than lets say organic food or home grown. And you see how the food factories work their workers to death for low wages too as they profit more from the more beef that's butchered with fewer employees.This film is interesting and informative it shows just how greedy and money hungry the food industry is. As money is put over health it was interesting to see how the process of food is done and very revealing was the premium the industry puts on corn syrup. And very cruel to see was the slaughter of pigs cattle and chicken yet even more cruel was the injections and feeding of corn and hormones before slaughter. Yet the film does show hope by showing the world of organic food and it encourages us to lobby congress for better food laws. Most telling was that of a Virginia farmer who still raises food the old fashion way with environment and grass weed he stays away from the process of high tech injections. Good doc that will make you feel guilty the next time you eat as when you buy out of the supermarket next or take that bite off of your plate you will think about the corrupt and nasty way it was processed even though it still taste juicy and sweet.".

	schema:headline " Food for thought that's not too tough on the stomach";
	schema:reviewBody "Robert Kenner's documentary Food Inc. sounds like something you've heard of before. When Eric Schlosser's book Fast Food Nation first woke America up to the horrific way that fast food meat is processed and Morgan Spurlock's documentary Super Size Me exposed the deadly health concerns of too much fast food most Americans began to associate fast food with unhealthy food. The organic food movement began to take off and most well educated Americans began to take what's in their food more seriously. But it hasn't been enough  Food Inc. breaks down why in this highly educational investigative film.The documentary highlights the problem on a corporate scale. Although we appear to have a wealth of options at the supermarket just because we're not buying from the big companies or going to the fast food restaurants as much doesn't mean we're not buying from the same process. The food industry has changed so much over the last 50 years because of the big companies that the way cattle chicken and pigs are raised have completely changed. The battle for healthier and safer food goes beyond choosing fast food.Kenner visits chicken farmers who are basically controlled by the big industry names. Not moving toward more engineering and efficiency is cause for loss of contract. These farmers are constantly in debt to meet these standards imposed by the major brands and thus have to meet them in order to work out of debt. He talks to a soybean cleaner being run out of business by Monsanto the company that engineered a pesticideresistant soybean and won the right to enforce that patent so that no farmer could save an unused engineered bean.The strength of the food lobby and the business people making the policy decisions in government is incredible. Kenner shows us how protected they are reminding us of when Oprah was sued for saying she wouldn't eat another burger on her show and had to fight forever before winning the case. The disconnect between the decisionmakers and the farmers is vast.Food Inc. also tries to inform us as much as possible for ways to instigate change rather than let us be completely overwhelmed by the apparent lack of control both the public and farmers have over food production.

	onyx:emotionText "Robert Kenner's documentary Food Inc. sounds like something you've heard of before. When Eric Schlosser's book Fast Food Nation first woke America up to the horrific way that fast food meat is processed and Morgan Spurlock's documentary Super Size Me exposed the deadly health concerns of too much fast food most Americans began to associate fast food with unhealthy food. The organic food movement began to take off and most well educated Americans began to take what's in their food more seriously. But it hasn't been enough  Food Inc. breaks down why in this highly educational investigative film.The documentary highlights the problem on a corporate scale. Although we appear to have a wealth of options at the supermarket just because we're not buying from the big companies or going to the fast food restaurants as much doesn't mean we're not buying from the same process. The food industry has changed so much over the last 50 years because of the big companies that the way cattle chicken and pigs are raised have completely changed. The battle for healthier and safer food goes beyond choosing fast food.Kenner visits chicken farmers who are basically controlled by the big industry names. Not moving toward more engineering and efficiency is cause for loss of contract. These farmers are constantly in debt to meet these standards imposed by the major brands and thus have to meet them in order to work out of debt. He talks to a soybean cleaner being run out of business by Monsanto the company that engineered a pesticideresistant soybean and won the right to enforce that patent so that no farmer could save an unused engineered bean.The strength of the food lobby and the business people making the policy decisions in government is incredible. Kenner shows us how protected they are reminding us of when Oprah was sued for saying she wouldn't eat another burger on her show and had to fight forever before winning the case. The disconnect between the decisionmakers and the farmers is vast.Food Inc. also tries to inform us as much as possible for ways to instigate change rather than let us be completely overwhelmed by the apparent lack of control both the public and farmers have over food production. There are people out there fighting such as the mother turnedadvocate of a boy who died of e.coli infection and there's proof that consumer choice can drive even the giants like WalMart to do things like only provide milk from cows without growth hormone. It also doesn't lean on the many possible grossout factors. If you've been eating processed meat all your life you won't come out of this film saying I'm going to be a vegetarian but you'll be wiser when it comes to your food purchases and who you support namely organic and local brands when you are at the grocery store.Food production has changed so much that it feels like Food Inc. is opening up a huge can of worms in terms of just how much is wrong with the process but the awareness that it will create in each of its viewers is enough to justify the documentary's broad scope.Steven C Visit my site at httpmovimusereviews.com";

The food industry certainly has it's reasons especially the almighty dollar and to be fair I think this movie kept that into perspective. Yet demonetization of these multinational organizations was inevitable because of the undesirable effects of such gross over production.The movie was tactful and at times utterly horrifying. To me this was nothing new. The movie lacked essential information was riddled with questionable assertions contained a few logical fallacies and was completely adulterated with naturalistic philosophy. It also tows the global warming line as well. Aside from it's shortcomings it is going to be powerful in its own right to those who are new to the subject.With such backing and credibility hopefully this can reach those in the darkness. Our modern social climate is inundated with massive propaganda so much that many have began to seek answers amidst the chaos. To those I hope this is but a small step to a much larger journey. In all assurances the rabbit hole is much deeper.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Food Inc. documentary directed by Robert Kenner shows the many problems in the food industry. The documentary displays the facts in a straight and simple manner. After seeing the film it made me think twice about what I was buying at the supermarket. My family and I started shopping at Whole Foods and the Fresh Market because we are more conscious about the food we eat now. Last year I saw this film for the first time and it got me thinking about organic foods. The documentary talks about choosing organic over inorganic frequently. I also did an essay for school on whether you should choose organic or inorganic foods because the film got me interested in which one to buy. I thought this was a good documentary because it made me take action and it made me tell other people about it. The director achieved his aim which was to change the way you think about your food. What made the film affective was the use of actual footage of the chickens and cows. I think it's disgusting how the animals are being treated and slaughtered. The documentary was made years ago and there still aren't people changing the way they are being slaughtered or kept. Also this documentary reminded me of the movie Supersize Me. Supersize Me is directed by Morgan Spurlock it shows him eating McDonalds for a month and he documents his weight and health. There's one scene that reminded me of Food Inc. which was when he talked about how McDonald's chicken McNuggets are made. Kenner used the same animations as Spurlock and I think those kinds of visuals really hit home to the viewer. Overall I thought this was a good documentary that informed the viewer on the issues in the food industry. I recommend this film to every person because I think everybody should know where there food comes from and how it's being made. We never think about where our food came from. This film will definitely change how you view food.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gregory LaCava directs a sensitive and thoughtprovoking film about the relationships among the staff and patients in a mental hospital circa 1935. The team efforts of psychiatrists Claudette Colbert and Joel McCrea and threatened when misogynistic head honcho Charles Boyer appears on the scene. He feels Colbert has no place in a man's profession.  His eyes are soon opened as he witnesses Colbert's skill and nohow with the patients. Provoking questions are injected here and there ie. McCrea states that he feels there's no difference between sanity and insanity  everyone moves within their own private world.  The film has a humanistic and sensitive approach to the subject  I felt involved and challanged by this films propositions.  Excellent support is provided by Helen Vinson as Boyer's sister with a dark past.  Joan Bennett is also on hand as the sweet wife of McCrea balancing the delicate mental world of a woman being cheated on by her husband.  This is another Paramount film that seems to be forever lost to TV or video.  Check those private collectors lists  this film is worth having.".

Joan Bennett is also on hand as the sweet wife of McCrea balancing the delicate mental world of a woman being cheated on by her husband.  This is another Paramount film that seems to be forever lost to TV or video.  Check those private collectors lists  this film is worth having.";

	schema:reviewBody "Until The Snake Pit and later One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest are superior films the film about mental illness up to when these two came out was Paramount's Private Worlds. It came out in 1935 and gave Claudette Colbert an Oscar nominated performance as the dedicated psychiatrist who has no time for romance. Unlike those other two classics Private Worlds deals more with the staff than with the patients. Colbert and colleague Joel McCrea have to swallow disappointment about McCrea not getting a promotion as head of the institution. Instead an outsider and a foreigner played by Charles Boyer gets the job. Boyer has some old fashioned notions about women in medicine there are doctors and there are nurses male and female because that's how God intended it. In the end Colbert does far more than just convince Boyer she's competent.Boyer also has a sister who lives with him and if he doesn't have enough crazies to deal with on the job Helen Vinson gives him an opportunity for research at home. She's flighty and irresponsible and she was responsible for someone's death and Boyer keeps her on a tight leash. Living with that at home no wonder he's such a pill at the office. For the life of me I'm still wondering how the French named accented Dr. Manet Boyer's character has an American sounding sister. Vinson gives her usual good performance so I guess people overlooked that back in the day.She sets her sights on McCrea and that causes an emotional breakdown in McCrea's wife Joan Bennett who was already jealous of all the time McCrea spent with Colbert.Down in the cast giving a really great performance as the grandmother of Nurse Ratched is Esther Dale whose answer to all problems with the patients is lock them in the rubber room in solitary. Seeing how Colbert deals with Guinn Williams as opposed to Dale really shows Colbert's worth to the institution.Claudette lost the Oscar in 1935 to Bette Davis for Dangerous and probably would not have won it again as she was the winner the year before for It Happened One Night. And Davis was not thrilled with her performance in Dangerous either.Though I believe The Snake Pit and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest are superior films Private Worlds still has its merits with some fine performances covering over a somewhat flawed story.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1935 it was considered quite daring for a leading studio like Paramount to take a chance on Private Worlds. Because depression weary audiences were more into the screwball delights of My Man Godfrey and Twentieth Century soap operas or gangster movies Phyllis Bottome's novel about mental institutions was considered a challenge to producer Walter Wanger. Story and cast were top drawer  Claudette Colbert was Queen of the Lot and she had decided to play Dr. Jane Everett a workaholic psychiatrist after showing the public she was a charming comedienne in The Gilded Lily. As the star Paramount wisely surrounded her with up and coming Charles Boyer pretty ingenue Joan Bennett popular Joel McCrea and all round bad girl Helen Vinson.Dr. Jane Everett Claudette Colbert and Dr. Alex McGregor Joel McCrea are trying their best to bring hope happiness and understanding into the lives of the mental patients of Brentwood Hospital. Alex is looking forward to a promotion to the role of Superintendent but in a surprise twist a French doctor Charles Manet Charles Boyer is promoted instead. Manet brings with him some old fashioned ideas about women doctors and the new fangled way Brentwood is being run. He has an instant ally in Matron Esther Dale whose favourite treatment  solitary confinement  has been frowned upon up to this time.Everyone has their own private world. Jane is a workaholic who cannot get over the death of a young man she was once in love with. Charles has bought his sister with him. Claire Helen Vinson is an acquitted murderess who may have been guilty and has a destructive streak which is now destroying Alex's marriage. Alex's wife Sally Joan Bennett is beautiful but highly strung and seems to have been living in the hospital grounds a bit too long. She reaches out to Carrie Flint I'm Carrie Flint  I've come to tea a disturbed young girl who Sally seems to identify with and feels she can reach out to. The movie comes to a climax when Sally suffers a complete breakdown and is rushed to the hospital  Alex doesn't realise as he is out with Claire. Of course Charles then realises he has found his soul mate in Jane  he just has to convince her!!Everyone in the cast is superlative  Claudette Colbert was nominated for an Academy Award but unfortunately lost to Bette Davis for her flashier part in Dangerous. This movie was a turning point for Joan Bennett and proved to people that she was a good actress and not just a pretty face. Jean Rouverol was unforgettable as Carrie Flint  she had a pretty exciting life herself. She and her husband were blacklisted in the 1950s and went to live in Mexico. Her last film appearance was in a 2009 short about Alzheimer's Disease. Her mother Aurania Rouverol created the Andy Hardy series. Some of Private Worlds impressive touches by underrated director Gregory La Cava  tilted camera angles to create mental disturbance seems clichd today but they weren't in 1935. Even though it was supposedly groundbreaking in it's approach it was 13 years before a major studio would take another chance on tackling the world of mental illness  20th Century Fox's The Snake Pit.Highly Highly Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "We all live in many worlds the soap opera Another World once declared and indeed this shows the dangerous world of psychiatry as seen through one particular institution where different methods are disagreed upon by the long time doctors and their new chief of staff. Claudette Colbert has a calming kindly way of dealing with even the most dangerous of patients and has created a bond with young doctor Joel McCrea whose fragile wife an excellent Joan Bennett is admittedly jealous of their bond even though she knows it is platonic. Nasty nurse Esther Dale despises the coddling manner in which these two psychiatrists treat their patients and when McCrea is turned down for the open chief of staff position Dale is overjoyed. The arriving new chief of staff Charles Boyer has something against women psychiatrists and immediately moves Colbert out of the men's ward and into the more sedate out patient program. Their initial differences are passiveaggressively manipulated by the Nurse Ratched like Dale who soon finds out that her methods aren't quite approved by Boyer either and uses knowledge of his sister Helen Vinson's past against him when she is threatened with termination. Bored with his pregnant wife McCrea begins to see the extremely neurotic Vinson which has a negative effect on Bennett's sanity that makes her see visions and hear things especially after she attempts to host a tea party with one of the more fragile patients at the institution. Starting off great this was intriguing and mesmerizing up to the point where Dale manipulated her way back into the position of head nurse more like a prison matron who barks orders at her nurse charges and treats the patients as if they were animals. I felt sorry for the actress Esther Dale typecast usually because of her hard looks as an unfeeling older woman because I hated her character with no regret right from the start. Dale who became a comical busybody in the Ma  Pa Kettle movie plays this role the exact same way she played her prison matron in Condemned Women. A nice change of pace for her was Holiday Affair as Janet Leigh's mother who is opinionated but quite big hearted. No case of that here and after the scene where she is reinstated she basically disappears anyway and the film goes down hill from there. Colbert somehow got an Oscar nomination for this she's good but certainly not outstanding while it is Bennett who gives truly the best performance just a few years before darkening her hair and becoming a film noir vixen. The photography and editing are excellent however reminding me of some of the photographic effects later utilized in The Lost Weekend and The Snake Pit which covered much of the same territory. Certainly psychiatry has changed a lot in the past 80 years for the better Thank God! but this isn't quite the drastic and cruel methods used in the Val LewtonBoris Karloff horror melodrama Bedlam which dealt with mental patients a century before this. Had the script focused more on improving the situation and dealing with nasty Dale rather than focusing on the growing romance between Colbert and Boyer I would have ranked this quite a bit higher.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS THROUGHOUT. 'Private Worlds' is a turgid melodrama that seems more like a soap opera than anything else. Each of the major characters has his or her bizarre subplot and there's no foreshadowing of any of these. We get no clue that Dr MacGregor's wife is emotionally disturbed until she suddenly starts hearing voices. We get no hint that Dr MacGregor is having an affair with Dr Monet's sister until we see them at it. In fact I had a great deal of trouble believing that Dr Monet French actor Charles Boyer and his sister Claire Texan actress Helen Vinson are siblings their accents don't match and I was positive that their ostensible siblinghood would turn out to be a cover for something else ... which turns out to be one of the few plot twists that does NOT happen.Claudette Colbert stars as Dr Jane Everest a hospital psychiatrist whom everyone else deems slightly abnormal because she's a woman who's dedicated to her job instead of yearning to be a wife and mother. Does anyone want to mount Everest? We see her demonstrating her rapport with several mental patients Guinn Williams chews the scenery as an escaped psychopath and Bess Flowers gives a sensitive and touching performance in a brief role as a depressive. Less convincing is Jean Rouverol in a poorlywritten role as the victim of childhood abuse. Esther Dale whom I've never liked is more annoying than usual here.The hospital's director has retired and Colbert is quidsin to be the new boss. But the board of directors can't have a gasp! WOMAN in charge! The new appointee is Charles Boyer with bedroom eyes and Casbah accent. He blithely tells Colbert he's taking her off the ward and transferring her to the outpatient clinic which he feels is a more suitable place for a woman. C'est la vie oui?Although released by Paramount this was an independent production of Walter Wanger and the low budget shows. Most of the cast give good performances despite weak material. Samuel S Hinds a reliable character actor who usually played pillars of integrity has an interesting piece of business here. Cast as Dr Arnold a dignified psychiatrist who quietly does his job Hinds attracts little attention until he casually mentions that he used to be a patient in this same mental hospital! The announcement never leads to anything so we never learn whether Dr Arnold is telling the truth or cracking a bad joke.Individual aspects of 'Private Worlds' are enjoyable and impressive but this really feels like a turgid soap opera rather than a drama of human relationships. At the end Colbert and Boyer suddenly decide to fall in love. Pass the anaesthetic please. I'll rate this thing 5 out of 10. Good night nurse!".

	schema:reviewBody "Private Worlds showcases some psychological aspects of the human nature. Dr Jane herself suffers a psychological dilemma after her lover's death  she is confined through the prison of the past. She is unable to see inside herself as she does with other patients but Dr. Monet insists on helping her overcome her trouble. The final scene is brilliant when Dr. Jane drops the doll implying her breaking with the past and starting a new life with Dr. Monet. There is another touching scene when Dr. Monet helps the dying old man with praying. It is a wellbuilt melodrama with subtle and impressive performances of the two leads Claudette Colbert and Charles Boyer as well as the outstanding direction of Gregory La Cava. .I think it is to the movie's credit that the choice of the subject with this impressive handling is quite unusual and unique in this time. It also supports women's work and proves her success even in professions mainly dominated by men.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though I was keen to watch this movie because of the terrific cast I expected to find its presentation of psychiatric medicine dated and naive. While this is at times true Claudette Colbert's treatment seems to be simply talking to the patients like a kindly elder sister Private Worlds also makes several observations that are relevant today including the thendaring one for the general audience that we all live in a private world and that the difference between sanity and insanity may be only a matter of degree. The doctors in the smaller roles are far more plausible than Colbert Charles Boyer and Joel McCrea who simply behave in accordance with their wellestablished screen personalities. But they are never so moviestarrish as to be unbelievable. The script cleverly uses the harshness of Boyer the new head of the hospital to forceful dramatic effect while most of his diktats make us regard him dubiously or unfavourably at the climax of the picture he is very harsh in a way that is clearly right and much more insightful than we had thought. Female viewers are helped in this favourable opinion by Boyer's looking extremely youthful and absolutely gorgeous. Two touches show a disregard for credibility that would never pass today. No one is surprised that in addition to being a psychiatrist Boyer is qualified to perform major surgery and is very good at it. And when a dying patient mumbles in Arabic the staff say what a pity it is that no one there understands him. For heaven's sake you think why don't they get a translator? How long has the poor man been there? These are more than compensated for however by the outburst from the crabby old matron who complainsthat too many patients are being cured and sent home! How can the hospital keep going she asks if it isn't full of sick people?".

Ana turns out to be famous and fame brings other love interests and a new life. Directed by Perdigo Queiroga this film has screenplay by Armando Vieira Pinto and the cast is headed by Amlia Rodrigues as Ana Maria Virglio Teixeira as Jlio Vasco Santana as Joaquim Marujo and Antnio Silva as Chico Fadista.This movie despite being one of the greatest classics of Portuguese cinema has two very curious features the first is that the story of main character is almost a biography of the actress who embodies it the great fado singer Amlia Rodrigues for which the film brought even more fame and success. The second feature is the apology of fado as a kind of national song. Fado is a music genre originally born in Lisbon's brothels and taverns where people used to drown his sorrows and sailors forget their loneliness. It's a sad nostalgic melancholic music that only in the twentieth century through government policy and propaganda went viral in the country. Nonetheless no one denies the beauty of fado the depth of its ballads and letters. This film although its propaganda to an idea that was wrong at that time deserves place in the heart of the Portuguese because this did happen over the decades.".

First of all to all those who objected to Trevor Howard the director of this film wanted to have all Native American actors and had arranged for Chief Dan George to play the title role but he became really ill just before shooting. There wasn't any other actors available who were Native Americans and they were lucky to get Trevor Howard who in most opinions did an amazing job. Every part of this film was authenticated and was extremely well received by the Native American communities. It may seem slow but then you are missing the point. It was not billed as an adventure movie and I am afraid you are comparing it with those that are. This movie was quite simply the story of a family that finally brought some respect to Native Americans who for years had been portrayed as awful cookie cutter images that were neither flattering nor accurate. Another interesting fact is that the committee that nominates films for Academy Awards did want to nominate this film but they had a dilemma. The movie had to be in the category of foreign films as it had subtitles but a movie that is in that category has to be nominated by the country it represents. This made it a catch 22 and at the time they could see no way to circumvent the rules and so the nomination fell through.".

	schema:reviewBody "A native Indian family fleeing from an area struck by disease is forced to be on the move during winter and grandfather is sick. With the last of his strength the old patriarch ascends to his death platform to join his ancestors. In these hard times resources are dear and a sick and dying old man with nothing more to contribute to the family must do the noble thing and not be a burden to his kin. He would slow them down and consume food blankets space and warmth that should nurture those who will carry on his line. He must go with dignity and walk on the wind. It is his time.But as it happens this old man's greatest adventure and finest moments are yet before him and as we shall see he will not only contribute a much greater boon to his family than they or he could ever imagine but he will ultimately find closure to a great tragedy he suffered in his own youth. Windwalker is a refreshingly different film. All dialogue is spoken in authentic native dialects with subtitles where necessary to aid the telling. The story unfolds through the use of the sparing English narration and wonderful visuals. Also refreshing is the absence of any caucasiannative interaction and angst. All characters are native North American Indian. Good guys bad guys those whom the viewer decides himselfherself are good bad or otherwise all are seen in a setting that predates the arrival of Europeans on the scene. Too it can be seen that the indigenous way of life really wasn't idyllic just because Caucasians had yet to come along and 'ruin' it! There is disease famine rapacious attacks from neighboring rival bands... Sort of like Europe in a way wasn't it? Free of heroic 'indian fighter' themes such as early cowboy movies had Windwalker is also free of the latest theme in which the 'white men' are portrayed as having destroyed the native's presumed blissful former lifestyle. It is a blessing to be able to watch and share a movie with a North American native setting that is completely free of any political leanings one way or another. No racial tension or posture exists because it's all native. Bravo!The story unfolds with enthralling straightforward simplicity and spiced with occasional dry humour reaches a satisfying conclusion. Suitable for all ages this is a movie well worth watching.".

	schema:headline " Simply Put A Triumph In Every Sense of the Word";
	schema:reviewBody "There are some films that I've seen where I can't fathom for the life of me of how overrated they've become on IMDb  many of them having hundreds of reviews and over inflated ratings  and then there are also films where I can't fathom how underrated or unknown they are having very little in the way of reviews or fame. 1980's Windwalker is one of those films that sadly falls into the latter category. Starring English actor Trevor Howard it's a movie that simply shouldn't be as good as it is mainly because of the fact Trevor Howard one of the quintessential English actors of his generation stars as an aging American Indian or Native American whatever you prefer Cheyenne warrior! Just hearing that fact alone would probably have you believe that the movie is one to be panned almost immediately. And yet my friends nothing could be further from the truth.The movie takes place in the rugged western wilderness of preEuropean North America during the brutally cold winters of that area and focuses on a family of Cheyenne and in particular on aging and dying warrior patriarch Windwalker Trevor Howard. As he lays dying of old age and decay he accepts that his time has come and begins to recount to his grandchildren his days as a young man those scenes being played by James Remar of how he came to win his wife and true love Tashira Serene Hedin the birth of his twin sons and how in one instance one of them was snatched and taken away and his lovely wife killed. Saddened by this memory but content that he has lived a good full life Windwalker dies and his laid to rest in the Cheyenne way. But little does the old warrior know the great spirit in the sky is not quite ready to let Windwalker's spirit onto the wind just yet for as his family is traveling back to lair they are attacked by a band of their hated enemy the Crow tribe. Using a combination of wisdom and powerful magic Windwalker sets on to his final adventure to save his family and make it more stronger in ways he never could have imagined.Windwalker is perhaps the most authentic movie ever done on Native Americans one reason due to the fact that there's not a single cowboy in sight and another because  other than some narration in English at times  the dialogue is spoken entirely in actual Cheyenne and Crow languages and dialect. Trevor Howard despite being English is absolutely and shockingly believable in his role as the Cheyenne warrior chief embarking on his last adventure becoming completely immersed in his character and in many ways actually becomes Windwalker. Adding to this is the performances of the other actors  some of whom are actually Native American  who all do a fine job be it James Remar as the young Windwalker Nick Ramus as Windwalker's son the beautiful Serene Hedin as Tashina even Billy Drago as one of the Crow scouts turn in believable performances. Another strong aspect of the film is the sets filmed in the wilds of Utah there were many times I thought I was watching a portrait being painted simply because the outdoor locations were so mesmerizing and beautiful. Director Kieth Merrill expertly takes all of these elements and weaves together a brilliant film that shows beauty the power the human spirit has when it comes to survival and also shows that violence and war are in no way limited to just one group of people. Indeed life among the native tribes was not as idyllic as some would have you believe. How in the world this film is not more widely known or did not even get one Oscar nomination is something I will never figure out for the life of me. To put it bluntly folks you are robbing yourselves by not seeing underrated gem and that's a phrase I use very sparling my friends. If you should ever have the opportunity to see this don't pass it up. I promise you are in for a real treat with this one. Also marks the first appearance of animal actor Bart the Bear.".

Saddened by this memory but content that he has lived a good full life Windwalker dies and his laid to rest in the Cheyenne way. But little does the old warrior know the great spirit in the sky is not quite ready to let Windwalker's spirit onto the wind just yet for as his family is traveling back to lair they are attacked by a band of their hated enemy the Crow tribe. Using a combination of wisdom and powerful magic Windwalker sets on to his final adventure to save his family and make it more stronger in ways he never could have imagined.Windwalker is perhaps the most authentic movie ever done on Native Americans one reason due to the fact that there's not a single cowboy in sight and another because  other than some narration in English at times  the dialogue is spoken entirely in actual Cheyenne and Crow languages and dialect. Trevor Howard despite being English is absolutely and shockingly believable in his role as the Cheyenne warrior chief embarking on his last adventure becoming completely immersed in his character and in many ways actually becomes Windwalker. Adding to this is the performances of the other actors  some of whom are actually Native American  who all do a fine job be it James Remar as the young Windwalker Nick Ramus as Windwalker's son the beautiful Serene Hedin as Tashina even Billy Drago as one of the Crow scouts turn in believable performances. Another strong aspect of the film is the sets filmed in the wilds of Utah there were many times I thought I was watching a portrait being painted simply because the outdoor locations were so mesmerizing and beautiful. Director Kieth Merrill expertly takes all of these elements and weaves together a brilliant film that shows beauty the power the human spirit has when it comes to survival and also shows that violence and war are in no way limited to just one group of people. Indeed life among the native tribes was not as idyllic as some would have you believe. How in the world this film is not more widely known or did not even get one Oscar nomination is something I will never figure out for the life of me. To put it bluntly folks you are robbing yourselves by not seeing underrated gem and that's a phrase I use very sparling my friends. If you should ever have the opportunity to see this don't pass it up. I promise you are in for a real treat with this one. Also marks the first appearance of animal actor Bart the Bear.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm sure that there is a story behind the casting of Trevor Howard as the old Cheyenne Indian who has led quite a life in Windwalker. We already know that Chief Dan George was originally supposed to be cast in the title role and that would have made rational sense certainly. Still Howard brings a certain noble dignity to the part of the old Cheyenne warrior though film fans on both sides of the pond are used to seeing him as ardent lover in his youth and barracks roisterer in his middle age in British films.As a young man Howard saw his wife killed and one of his two twin sons kidnapped by the Cheyenne hereditary enemy the Crow. Later on in old age Howard is as custom has put while not quite dead on the funeral pyre. When he doesn't die being out there in the cold it occurs to him that their might be some higher purpose for him being kept alive. He rolls off that pyre and goes back to his family. And the rest of Windwalker is Howard learning why the Great Spirit has kept him alive.Windwalker is one of those sleeper films that people enjoy discovering. It is a film about Indian culture out in the plains and Rocky Mountains before the white man arrived. It is caringly and lavishly photographed in some rugged terrain the more realistic to make this film. It was what Dances With Wolves came to be later the ultimate film about Indian life and lore. Nick Ramus and James Remar are wonderful as the two sons.This film came and went very quickly. Back in the day in 1980 when it first came out. I met a young man in one of our fabulous gay bars back then named Tommy Barker who had lived on a reservation though he was not an American Indian. He was quite steeped in the culture and we went to see Windwalker. It was great to see it with someone who really appreciated the film and its authenticity. I lost track of Tommy shortly after that. He was a great person and I certainly hope that he's not in the past tense for good. This review is dedicated to him.The phrase that Charles Dickens used in describing Dr. Manette in A Tale Of Two Cities Recalled to Life is how I think of Windwalker. I think you'll be blown away when you see it.".

The fact that it was told in subtitles didn't make a difference due to the great directing and greater actors. I wish I had seen this movie when it first came out because of the cinema effect used on some of the scenes reminded me of the other great fantasy movies of that time. Movies like Merlin The Superman Trilogyand Legend. I loved that glossy throwback effect from the 1930's. I think anyone would love to watch this and the simple magical tale it depicts.

The story takes a bit of time in the telling and since it's not a traditional Western some may find the lack of action to be an issue to the point of tedium. One thing that could definitely have been done better was to name the principal characters as the story progressed. For example I never heard Smiling Wolf referred to by name nor the names of Dancing Moon Spotted Deer and Horse That Follows. If those names didn't show up in the credits I would never know they were part of the story and even now I'm unable to place them with the characters.The surprise here of course is the way British actor Trevor Howard portrays the old Windwalker quite apart from the historical characters he often got to do in the Forties. His craggy features and gravelly voice suited him well here with a look that didn't force you to suspend disbelief that he wasn't a Native American.

	schema:reviewBody "There was Windwalker.It's been ages since I've seen this movie. In fact I think the last time I saw it was in the theatre or on HBO a few months after it had been pulled from its initial release. I think most of all I remember the ending and thinking how heart felt and touching it was. It's nice to think that in someway we will consciously be reunited with loved ones when we die but the truth is we aren't when we pass on though it makes for some great mythology.And that's the thing that struck me about this film that is how it shows unintentionally the parallels of other cultures that went through a tribal period of development. A time when your society is just realizing who they are and are trying to come to terms with nature an always impersonal and sometimes hostile environment in which it is a struggle to survive not to mention other individuals or groups who want what you have.And we see the first person narrative of a man trying to come to terms with his surroundings. He applies his own sense of order upon an nature's impersonal surroundings. And that's true of all cultures and as an amateur scientist it was interesting to see how the drama unfolded in this time before the historic clash of cultures of European and Asian cultures visiting the Americas the Vikings not withstanding. It's a period drama that focuses on a culture that's more basic. There's a technological base which is not quite bronze age not quite medieval but a bit beyond the stone age.Other positive aspects are Reed Smoot's artistic lensing which really adds a sense of authenticity and by capturing the majesty of of the Rocky Mountains or Sierras where the film take place. The cloud enshrouded mountains dusted with snow the coniferous forests which are lush and green and the wilderness in winter and spring. It really is a pleasure to watch for that alone.The other high point of this film is the music. We hear the echoing flute giving us some basic melodies that accentuate the expansiveness of rugged North America populated by animals and Native American tribes. The music like all good scores accentuates the emotions of the scene without being too narrative. It adds auditory flavor and helps give us a sense of wide open spaces or tracks of land that are untapped rugged wild and are there to be used to sustain the life of the tribe. There's a kind of mysticism that could be gleamed or interpreted from the music and that's probably intentional but I don't put stock in spiritual themes. It is man's own early interpretation that we're witnessing here as he fights for survival against cruel odds.But not all is struggle. There are tender moments in this film although perhaps a bit too few though one begins to think that if there were more then the film may have verged on being saccharine. The story itself is not uncommon but has a kid of paleolithic twist by virtue of it being about Native American tribes. Yet it should resound with all cultures across the globe. From Russia to the Middle East to Southeast Asia the South Seas and certainly Europe and Africa. There really is a commonality expressing who we are as human beings in this film. There's a lot of things in this film that can be commented on. But in the end it's a kind of love story and story about survival and coming to terms in a primitive way with nature.Definitely worth seeing at least once.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes the dialog is in Cheyenne and Crow and the actors do a remarkably good job with pronunciation tone pacing etc. Yes the wardrobe is largely authentic although in many cases the characters wore way more clothes than real Cheyenne or Crow would have. Yes a lot of the Cheyenne and Crow traditions motives etc. were accurately portrayed. Yes some of the children were portrayed by real Navajo kids.The story was an OK telling of the life of a man and his family shown in both forward and backward chronology. But for me it raised too many unanswered questions to make sense in the end.How are we supposed to cheer for a brash douchebag of a young Cheyenne who steals enemy Crow horses as a dowry without considering the horrible impact it will have on himself and all the people around him? What year was it anyway? Horses didn't come to the New World until Spanish settlersinvaders brought them in the 1600's and they didn't reach Cheyenne territory until the 1700's. One of the Crow wears a Hudson Bay blanket jacket but those didn't make it past the Great Lakes until railroads arrived in the 1800's.What was the deal with the central character having blue eyes? The actor who played the old man wore tinted lenses clearly visible in closeups. James Remar who played the same character younger has naturally blue eyes. In the book does the main character have blue eyes too? Was it even necessary to the story? If the actors are in colored lenses why not brown ones? How does an old man just risen from death or near death kill and skin a bear? And how does he tan the hide in a day? And this isn't a question no Cheyenne Crow or other Native American would leave the blood of his enemy on his own skin after a fight. That's sort of like willingly turning yourself into a voodoo doll for your enemy to abuse.Likewise Cheyenne women would never be as passive as they were portrayed. They'd be fighting fast and brutal along with their man no hesitation no hiding.The story? Kind of OK nothing special but mostly it was a vehicle for sumptuous tableaux showcasing beautiful Natives against nature's golden splendor. You know stuff you'd see airbrushed on the side of a customized van.".

	schema:headline " Native American film from 1980";
	schema:reviewBody "Released in late 1980 Windwalker is an unconventional Western in that there are no white people cowboys cavalry etc. and all the dialogue is spoken in Native languages with English subtitles the story takes place in what later became Utah in 1797 with flashbacks to 50 years earlier. Trevor Howard plays an aged Cheyenne who's about to die and James Remar plays the younger version of the same man. The plot revolves around the Cheyenne's family and their skirmishes with a small band of Crow warriors. Nick Ramus Serene Hedin and Dusty McCrea also have significant roles.This is a beautiful and wellintentioned film but it's not without some weaknesses. The Utah wilderness locations are picturesque and the score is pleasant albeit dated it sounds exactly like what it is early 80s New Age music made for an historical fantasy film about Native Americans. And whereas the Cheyenne and Crow characters look generally authentic they somehow appear too clean like they put on their brandnew Native clothing a few hours before filming in other words it smacks of fantasy more than reality. The depiction of Natives in Jeremiah Johnson eight years earlier was noticeably superior. Another negative is the usage of white dudes in major Native roles and Asian boys as Indian children but I guess they had to do what they had to do to get the film made. And besides Howard has Indianlooking facial features despite the color of his eyes and I wouldn't be surprised if Remar had Native blood in his veins. As far as the Asian boys goes didn't Native Americans originate from Asia in the first place? In other words they're acceptable substitutes to genuine Native Americans.Despite the negatives this is definitely a beautiful film I just wish the story was more realistic and interesting like the depiction of 17th century Natives in 1991's excellent Black Robe one of my alltime favorite movies. Although a lot of the story in Windwalker is good there are a lot of comic book elements and it's at times fantastical. Moreover the story raises questions like how does this elderly man just risen from death or near death kill and skin a bear? And how long does it take him to tan the hide? It looked like a day.Still the movie's worth seeking out if the positives trip your trigger. A lot of people love Windwalker.The film runs 108 minutes.GRADE C".

The film confused me right from the start with Trevor Howard's performance as a Cheyenne elder. I had wondered if Windwalker intended for its title character to be white like Little Big Man was Anglo. Then I was further confounded when I saw James Remar playing Windwalker as a young man. How did a young white American transform into an old British thespian? Furthermore how did this combination mystically form a Native American? Anyhow there were aspects of the movie that I did admire. First I liked the use of native languages people who hate subtitles should try reading a book more often though English still crept into the narration for no apparent reason. Also the story was worthwile and quite engaging in some parts. In the hands of a different production team the movie could have been great. As it stands the pace is slack and the mystical scenes are goofy. On a very minor note could someone change the box art please? For some reason that picture of the whitehaired Trevor Howard looking toward the heavens gives me the creeps. I cannot pull for a hero who might be inclined toward selfmutilation or demonic possession well I guess I can but not in this instance. Das ist alles.".

The movie I saw on basic cable this morning would barely rate PG. Massive cuts and edits were evident all through the film. Entire scenes were removed. The dialog was edited so that you'd think it was made in the 1950's. The hilarious masturbation scene was edited in such a way that it appeared Linda walked in on Brad while he was peeing. They actually ran the film backwards during this scene. Even some of the musical soundtrack had changed due to rights issues I'd guess.My point is if you've only seen this movie on basic cable you really haven't seen this movie. The version I saw today was on AE and they just butchered it. Things like that should be illegal.".

Amy Heckerling's Fast Times at Ridgemont High was the textbook definition of life as a teenager in the eighties and remains so to this day.  The story was brought to life in a very unique way that hasn't been duplicated sinceThere was no actual plot to speak of.  This was just...High School.  It's a film about a group of kids looking for love status or a good buzz.  The film was nothing more than that and it didn't pretend to be more. In addition Cameron Crowe's script made you care about what these kids went through as if their individual situations were happening to us as they may very well have.  It's almost a crime that a sequel was never made although a mediocre TV series was spawned.   Armed with a cast of characters that struck a chord with all of us primarily because we knew someone in High School who acted just like them and a soundtrack that reeked of the Mark GoodmanJ.J. Jackson era of MTV this film stands as a perfect portrait of a decade a lot of us say we'd like to forget....shortly before brushing the dust off an old Night Ranger cassette and indulging in a guilty pleasure.".

	schema:headline " The 80's Teen Culture at Its Finest";
	schema:reviewBody "Fast Times at Ridgemont High 1982Cameron Crowe's script for Fast Times at Ridgemont High' has totally held up in the nearly 20 years since it's release in its portrayal of teenage life. Virtually plotless the movie just follows the stories of a group of teenagers as they go about life in high school. And like so many 80's teen movies it rightfully takes place for quite a bit of its run at the local mall. I find this movie to be extremely realistic even in its somewhat exaggerated depictions of what some of the characters do Jeff Spicoli ordering a pizza in the middle of class or Charles Jefferson's winning of the football game by venting his anger at the school that supposedly trashed his car. But this is after all a movie and a pretty good one too. And check out all those kickass 80's arcade games! droolsI'll try and give my best recollection of each of the main character's basic storylines. Let's see Jeff Spicoli is the ideal surfer dude emptyheaded sporting Hawaiian shirts and talking in irresistible slang. He dislikes the uptightness of school particularly personified by his history teacher Mr. Hand. The two begin to have a battle of the wills. Brad Hamilton is a senior who goes from one fastfood job to the next who has no idea what he is supposed to do with his life even though everyone including his guidance counselor expects a lot from him. Stacy Hamilton is a guycrazy chick who is sensitive but who wants sex and attention leading her first into the arms of an older man and eventually into those of Mike Damone a cocky hustler when the only guy who genuinely cares for her is nerdy Mark Ratner. Damone is a shady character a charming sweettalker who scalps tickets and does what he can for a quick buck. He tries to help Ratner score with Stacy but then steals the girl. Ratner is an insecure nerdtype who is good at heart who works at the mall movie theater and who just wants his shot with Stacy. He finds himself brokenhearted when he uncovers Damone's betrayal. Linda Barrett is Stacy's best friend and confidante a sexy confident girl who is constantly moving from one guy to the next and sort of becomes a quasi role model for Stacy. That's the basic premise for all of what goes on.Probably the most famous line is that uttered by Sean Penn's Jeff Spicoli Aloha Mr. Hand.' I'm not sure if it's the Hawaiian talk or the idiocy of the teacher's name that has made this line so supremely quoted over the years. Anyone who has seen the movie recognizes it immediately. I can say immediately that I have never ever seen Penn play a part like this and I don't think I've ever seen a surfer personified with such grace. Even though the conflict between Spicoli and Mr. Hand is lighthearted I always wanted to see them having a fistfight in the halls. Stacy's story is actually pretty serious.she winds up being the victim of a teenage pregnancy which is not often addressed in a teen comedy. Her eventual realization that Mark is the guy for her seems natural and not scripted. And thankfully they're only starting to date by the end of the movie and not getting engaged or married or something equally stupid as in some lesser movies. Damone is such a weird offbeat character and his friendship with Ratner so unusual that I have to give Cameron Crowe credit for making it all work. Brad seems to have the least to do with the other characters but as an unsuccessful gogetter I can definitely relate to him.In conclusion this is one of my favorite 80's teen movies. It goes a lot deeper than The Breakfast Club' and its adult characters though not wellsculpted are treated with more warmth and humanity than many of teen comedies. It's a required viewing for teens young adults and anyone with a fondness for 80's culture.Grade A".

I'm pretty sure this movie is funnier now just because Sean Penn has had a successful career as a proper dramatic actor and he plays the ultimate surfer dude perfectly. The grudge between himself and Mr Hand Ray Walston is great and probably produces the best or at least funniest moments of the film.All in all Fast Times is fun. It might be because it's dated cheesy and clichd but it still does the job and it is entertaining.".

I'm only 19 just finished high school and I live in Australia and many of the aspects rings true for me as it does for almost anybody that you talk to that grew up in that era of America's history.Many aspects of the movie are absolutely hilarious but sometimes a few of the smaller jokes miss their mark and you will only notice the joke and laugh on another viewing which I strongly recommend in doing so. The characters are all great but are all surpassed by Jeff Spicoli portrayed by Sean Penn in one of his first roles and his surfer character has been imitated many times but never bested yes Bill  Ted are ranked at 2nd and he steals almost every scene he was in.In the movie you'll see some of the most accurate depictions of sex in a teen comedy which caused the movie to be quite censored and it downplays the Hollywood glitz of it all by portraying a girl lose her virginity in a dirty used baseball dugout covered in graffiti and then complaining it hurt the next day... one of the characters masturbating while a very enticing dream sequence occurs only to be disturbed by the object of the dream... and even a sex scene where the teenaged boy cums early after a few seconds which ends up getting the girl pregnant because of no condom use.Its these kinda portrayals of teenage life that I'm glad Hollywood makes movies and I know when I have some kids of my own I'll be showing this movie to them first above any other teen movies like American Pie and such... to show them what the real world can be like while still keeping it in a comedy situation.Rating 910Recommendation See this movie... numerous times its great its funny... its real.".

So many actors got a start here.Cage and Whittaker are hardly there so not much interesting to see. The two really interesting ones are Penn and Leigh. I've seen this film Sweet and Lowdown' and The Pledge' in quick succession. Of male actors working today Penn and Downey are in a class by themselves. Downey being more internally focused. Penn likes to let us watch weaving his own watching his display of himself and his display of his character into a single performance.You can see him doing that here. I recommend you get the DVD and listen to the comments of writer and director. After nearly twenty years these guys still apparently don't know what Penn is doing. He's graduated and they are still in high school.Jennifer Jason Leigh fascinates. I think she is every bit as serious an actress as Penn. But she has an instrument that holds her back  being a woman actor carries a curse because there are fewer risks you can take in how you move your body. Think why we don't have a female Jim Carrey.Lesser actors like say Jeanne Tripplehorn have a more appealing instrument so we the audience accepts more effect with less talent. The contrast is so much greater here with Leigh working next to Cates. Just as all Americans are inescapably racist in some way we all have this highschool level barrier of archetypes of woman that limits our skills as dramatic viewers. Sissy Spacek another effective actress suffered from this same problem I think.I'm sure the dynamic about how actors find intelligent roles has much to do with small town politics but Leigh has given us a Mrs Parker' and a reporter in Hudsucker' that is every bit as selfreferential as Penn's Surfer Bud. The problem is us I'm afraid. We need to graduate.Also. A lesson for P T Anderson. Crowe here writes the characters first they are based on real people then creates a series of small episodes. This works when the point is to evoke a general feel as in the porn industry Boogie Nights' here the rock industry in Almost Famous.' But usually that environmental impression has much less impact than other narrative approaches can accomplish in drama. Watch this film and you are reminded that its only charm is the evocation of an environment which has since been mined numb. Better to develop into real drama. Crowe hasn't since this. Let's hope PT does.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a very special film to me. It's the first high school movie that actually portrayed what REALLY went on inside the schools of the 1980's. What is seen in the movie is not only true and slightly disturbing but also really funny in ironic ways.The movie shows the interactions of a bunch of high school students all of which are unforgettable. I was especially very fond of Jennifer Jason Leigh since she gave a very realistic performance as a 15yearold high school student who finally gets laid at the beginning of the movie but later decides that she wanted a real relationship instead of just sex. Sean Penn's performance was arguably the least realistic but he was hilarious as the dopedout high school dude. And Judge Reinhold who later on costarred in the Beverly Hills Cop films was funny and likable as Jennifer Jason Leigh's older brother.There are many great 80's songs featured in the soundtrack. The very first song called We Got the Beat jumpstarts the beginning of the film with a blast. Then later on we hear the song Somebody's Baby twice when Jennifer's character has sex two times with different men. Although the song is a happy song it can make the sex scenes awkward since Jennifer looked very young for her age. I always had to look away from the screen whenever Jennifer was naked because she looked too cute! It was disturbing to see at first but I got over it.The only bad thing about the movie is that it's very short. But it can also be a good thing since a shorter film means that people can watch it more times in a row. When I first got the DVD I watched the movie 3 times in one day! It's one of the only movies that I can actually watch many times in a row.Overall this was a great highschool movie with lots of laughs and memorable moments. And despite the fact that some may get offended by the nudity and the short film duration the movie will still remain as a cult classic in my book.I give this film a 1010.P.S Look out for early roles  cameos by Forest Whitaker and Nicholas Cage in this movie!".

'Fast Times' deserves special kudos because it came out when the times in question were still taking place  in fact 'Fast Times' would go on to define its era as the mustsee comedy for those who made up the movie's subject matter back in late '82 and early '83.Here's my problem It's not much of a comedy. Sure it has funny moments but it's very downbeat too much of the time. The two main female characters played by Jennifer JasonLeigh Stacy and Phoebe Cates Linda give solid performances but have hardly a true laugh between them other than Cates' simple action of opening a door. The male characters have their funny scenes too but inbetween acts of such casual cruelty and harshness that it really doesn't compensate. Here's something to ponder The funniest performance in this film is by a guy whose only other comedies were 'Shanghai Surprise' and 'We're No Angels.' Sean Penn is very good as Spicoli but he's got the one character you are encouraged to laugh at him and Ray Walston's Mr. Hand of course both hilarious. 'Jefferson was saying if we don't get some cool rules pronto we'll be bogus too!' When they aren't in the film my attention drifts. As a comedy it's alternately funny and flailing. As a drama this is an afterschool special with swear words and nudity.'Fast Times' is fun to watch simply for the timecapsule elements. Writer Cameron Crowe really had his ear to the ground as he took measure of a LAarea high school in the guise of a student and director Amy Heckerling has a clearly sympathetic understanding for the tribal rites of the young. The score is warmedover '70s mellow guitar rock already past its prime but offers great songs none better than Jackson Browne's last great hit 'Somebody's Baby' which had its first release on the 'Fast Times' soundtrack and might be subtitled 'Stacey's Sex Theme' as it shows up whenever she gets it on. Heckerling doesn't gloss up the sex the first such scene takes place in a grimy concrete bunker with the memorable graffito 'Surf Nazis' over Stacy's head and that's to her credit. The film's grittiness works in this way for me because the early '80s seem on retrospect a less innocent time than the earlier eras depicted in the other teen films the first time in which sex between young people could be truly casual while traditional religious and social strictures seemed to fall mute. In that way she hits the right notes.But Heckerling accepts this casualness to the point of promulgating it. We see Stacy unabashedly learning about oral sex with a carrot and getting an abortion in which her main source of pain seems to be about getting a ride and money from the guy who knocked her up. With AIDS just around the corner and a host of moral issues surrounding unbridled sex among minors I find myself wanting to scream at the screen like Mr. Hand 'What are you people on dope?'That's a personal issue a lot of 'Fast Times' viewers won't join me in feeling. What I think is a broader problem is the shallowness of the story lines and the characters how lacking in deeper resonance they are. As Heckerling points out in her joint DVD commentary with Crowe Mark Rat Ratner is someone who finds sex as difficult as others find trigonometry. He's a nerd and I can relate so how is it the attractive sexually active Stacey chooses him and seeks a relationship with him? Hot girls don't chase nerds simple as that. The film might have tried to flesh out this relationship and offer some explanation why else she likes him other than his awkward smile his obvious desire and his willingness to offer her some encouragement after Mr. Vargas' morgue demonstration but you are left with a couple of halffinished awkward conversations and the sense that they had to wind up together because they are the lead actors.'Fast Times' is a fun film to watch but thin as the soles on a pair of checkered loafers. It's the definitive teen film of its time but 'Valley Girl' and 'Sixteen Candles' have better narratives 'The Breakfast Club' more interesting characters and 'Last American Virgin' a stronger ending. If it was just Sean Penn and Ray Walston sitting at Perry's Pizza for ninety minutes in a sort of 'My Dinner With Spicoli' I think 'Fast Times' would have been more fun.".

This film has superlative direction cinematography screenplay setting costume soundtrack and acting. All the artists involved deliver unequivocal portrayals of life during the 80's. In particular Penn Leigh Reinhold Cates and Walston are superb. Penn created one of the most memorable characters Jeff Spicoli to ever appear on film. Spicoli became a lifestyle for many fans. This viewer owned his first pair of black and white checkered Vans soon after the film. The plot revolves around two precocious teenage girls named Stacy and Linda. Stacy takes advice from her supposedly experienced best friend Linda and soon finds herself in a love triangle with a nice guy and his not so nice guy best friend. While this is all going down Spicoli who lives to surf and get high unwittingly starts to do battle with the strict teacher every highschool in the 80's had Mr. Hand. Mr. Hand despises Spicoli's lifestyle and antics but eventually comes to enjoy the company of the loveable and somewhat oblivious stoner. The plot is clever funny offbeat heartfelt insightful and has a hilarious ending. The film has flaws and is not perfect but it's exemplary depiction of teenage life in the 80's makes up for it. There are so many memorable scenes and famous quotes in this film. One of the most unforgettable scenes is Linda's exiting the pool and heading to the bathroom. It's quite uncomfortable for one of the characters. To this day you'll hear fans utter such lines as Spicoli's All I need are some tasty waves a cool buzz and I'm fine. This is a timeless classic film in it's genre. It's a stellar homage to the 80's.".

	schema:headline " disturbing depiction of teens as numb  dumb";
	schema:reviewBody "Reviewers who call this a great comedy must be kidding. This is one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. I can't tell if the filmmakers intended to make a social commentary on disaffected youth. But surely we're not meant to laugh at the sight of emotionally detached morally empty teens? Oh I'm aware that teenagers do stupid things and I'm not appalled by the portrayal of drug use sex etc. These things happen. I am appalled by the notion that lifechanging events such as losing one's virginity getting pregnant or having an abortion can be considered no big deal. These characters don't think before they act and they don't seem to feel anything afterward. This is what disturbs me about Fast Times and this is what I thankfully can't relate to.It's interesting that TV shows like Dawson's Creek were criticized for their supposedly unrealistic depiction of teens with large vocabularies who made a big deal out of everything and discussed their feelings. However at least those kids had thoughts and feelings! As an intelligent sensitive kid so did I. Guess I didn't have the universal teen experience. But personally I'd rather read or watch a story about adolescents who overanalyze and feel deeply than one where kids act like unthinking zombies. Shouldn't storytellers encourage growth and depth rather than perpetuating a shallow way of life?Apparently Cameron Crowe went undercover in a high school and based his story on real events which frankly scares me. Was this truly the '80s generation? Is this the current generation? And when making a film is it enough to hold up a mirror to reflect society? Or shouldn't the filmmaker go a step further to comment on what he sees? Maybe even try to make the world a better place? True many viewers are turned off by films that seem preachy but if writersdirectors are skilled enough I believe they can get a message across effectively. The best stories have a point a lesson to be learned. I cannot figure out what Fast Times is trying to achieve.Other than to gross me out. For instanceA 15 year old girl loses her virginity to an older man she barely knows who must be able to tell she's inexperienced and underage but doesn't seem to care outside while staring at graffiti. Is this supposed to be a comment on how degrading and meaningless sex can be? On the fact that first times are rarely enjoyable especially if you don't feel anything for the other person? A warning to choose your partner wisely? Perhaps but it's certainly unpleasant to witness. And difficult to understand why she goes through with it.

	onyx:emotionText "Reviewers who call this a great comedy must be kidding. This is one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. I can't tell if the filmmakers intended to make a social commentary on disaffected youth. But surely we're not meant to laugh at the sight of emotionally detached morally empty teens? Oh I'm aware that teenagers do stupid things and I'm not appalled by the portrayal of drug use sex etc. These things happen. I am appalled by the notion that lifechanging events such as losing one's virginity getting pregnant or having an abortion can be considered no big deal. These characters don't think before they act and they don't seem to feel anything afterward. This is what disturbs me about Fast Times and this is what I thankfully can't relate to.It's interesting that TV shows like Dawson's Creek were criticized for their supposedly unrealistic depiction of teens with large vocabularies who made a big deal out of everything and discussed their feelings. However at least those kids had thoughts and feelings! As an intelligent sensitive kid so did I. Guess I didn't have the universal teen experience. But personally I'd rather read or watch a story about adolescents who overanalyze and feel deeply than one where kids act like unthinking zombies. Shouldn't storytellers encourage growth and depth rather than perpetuating a shallow way of life?Apparently Cameron Crowe went undercover in a high school and based his story on real events which frankly scares me. Was this truly the '80s generation? Is this the current generation? And when making a film is it enough to hold up a mirror to reflect society? Or shouldn't the filmmaker go a step further to comment on what he sees? Maybe even try to make the world a better place? True many viewers are turned off by films that seem preachy but if writersdirectors are skilled enough I believe they can get a message across effectively. The best stories have a point a lesson to be learned. I cannot figure out what Fast Times is trying to achieve.Other than to gross me out. For instanceA 15 year old girl loses her virginity to an older man she barely knows who must be able to tell she's inexperienced and underage but doesn't seem to care outside while staring at graffiti. Is this supposed to be a comment on how degrading and meaningless sex can be? On the fact that first times are rarely enjoyable especially if you don't feel anything for the other person? A warning to choose your partner wisely? Perhaps but it's certainly unpleasant to witness. And difficult to understand why she goes through with it. Stacy moves on to her next sexual partner like she's changing shoes then casually asks the boy to pay for her abortion as if she's asking him to buy her a soda. Is this meant to be humourous or is it just bad acting? The aftermath of the abortion is also treated like it's no big deal when in fact it would be a painful process both emotionally and physically.

	schema:reviewBody "I have read many reviews in this forum by people that can only be young and uninformed that claim that movies such as Drive Me Crazy Here On Earth 10 Things I Hate About You and such are the best films around that are about teenagers and high school. That is not a stupid opinion only an opinion of someone that has never bothered to rent those comedies from the section of the local video store that gathers dust. Films like the ones mentioned are squalid imitations produced and written by misguided souls that are doing their best to cash in on a genre that has been dead for years. And yet they succeed. But if you want to check out and admire the pioneers of the business you have to go back to the Encyclopedia of the 80's and look for names like Hughes Heckerling Linson Kouf Boaz Davidson and so on. There you will find films with titles such as The Breakfast Club Secret Admirer The Wild Life Mischief Last American Virgin and Fast Times At Ridgemont High. Disguising today's excuse for teen comedies as honest attempts to delve into the psyche of today's youth is nothing but chicanery and should be uncovered for what it really is. Just a cheap knock off.Fast Times is the ultimate high school comedy that features everything from subtle observations like kids sniffing freshly photocopied paper to more overt gestures like teens and young sex. The films was written by a young Cameron Crowe who has gone on to be famous with films like Say Anything and Jerry Maguire. But back in the early 80's he returned to high school in cognito to observe teens and their rituals and the result was his book based on his studies. Some of the students were so angered at his film because they said that his characters were to much like the ones he knew and hung out with. And if that is true can you imagine what it was like to know a guy like Jeff Spicolli? Here is one of the all time funniest characters that has now been imitated to the point of banality. Here is a guy that wants nothing more than to have sex smoke some weed drink some beer and squeak by in his World History class. Oh yea and surfing is his passion. I don't think we were prepared for a character like Spicolli because I have never seen an imitation of him done quite right. He is the perfect caricature of the 80's surfer dude. As one of his classmates says  This guys been stoned since the third grade. If the Spicolli character is the comic genius of Fasttimes the rest of the cast is the reality. There is a pallet of interesting characters played by young and energetic soon to be famous stars that started their careers in this film. Jennifer Jason Leigh Phoebe Cates Judge Reinhold Forrest Whitaker Sean Penn and even lesser known faces like Anthony Edwards Eric Stoltz and Nicolas Cage all started in this film. Look at where they are today.Fast Times is the blueprint of any film that wants to capitalize on the teen market. There is well thought out comedy painstaking relationships the rahrah bravado of high school sports the essential prom night sex drugs rock and roll and of course the excitement of working at the coolest place in the mall. This is one of the funniest yet most poignant films about high school and growing up. If you think the Godfather is the Bible of all mafia movies Halloween is the godfather of horror films and Raiders of the Lost Ark is the pioneer of action films then you will understand that Fast Times at Ridgemont High is THE original high school flick. For those who think any film released in the late 90's or early 00's  with the exception of American Pie  is the best you can get then please do yourself a favour see this film. There is no contest. Every idea in todays films has been borrowed from the great ones from only a couple of decades ago. Look no further than this great movie. It is the one to watch.10 out of 10".

As with many movies employing such a theatrical device the glib MovieLand behaviors exhibited by the supposed 7 yearold autistic child in the film don't resemble genuine kids afflicted with genuine disabilities so much as the behaviors resemble cartoonish soapopera conveniences. Viewers could be reminded of Ed Norton's brilliant performance in The Score where the actor portrays a character who fakes mental retardation and then flips back and forth between the fake puton afflicted behaviors and the real criminal's behaviors throughout the film as part of the film's narrative development. Something about Norton's great work there somehow highlighted most other MovieLand characters with mental problems as a cheapo Hollywood trick used as a melodramatic gag when real inspiration has fled. Anyway the kid here was annoyingly corny as he did what can only be described as a stand up imitation of of a cliche.Overall great folks in a horrible movie. It happens sometimes. Forgive Dreyfuss and forgive Tyler they did go on to do better and much more real roles later on. I gave this a 3 out of 10 because of those two actors and their inherent screen presence.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't take joy in writing negative reviews especially for films I thought I would be doing the opposite for. I'm a big fan of Richard Dreyfuss' work as he stars in my all time favourite movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind. So it was only natural when I heard about this film I was rather intrigued. And of course as well as Dreyfuss there's an all star cast of Linda Hamilton John Lithgow Liv Tyler and JT Walsh. I even watched the trailer and I thought it looked good. I wasn't able to buy the film on DVD in Region 2 UK so I had to buy the Region 1 addition luckily I have a multi regional DVD player.But sadly it wasn't worth the hassle. Silent Fall was very disappointing. I didn't like the style it was filmed in the way the story folded and John Lithgow being in this movie may as well have been classed as a Cameo. Linda Hamilton's role is nothing to get excited about as her character hardly has any purpose or screen time. It doesn't even feel like a theatrical movie. I felt like I was watching something made for the Hallmark channel.It's a shame really because the plot of this film actually has potential to become a good story take away the obvious twist and the whole voice mimicking stuff. If this project was handled better and better use of the supporting actors this could have gone on to become a really good film.And then there's Liv Tyler's debut. Don't get too excited over that either. I think anyone watching her in this will be in for a shock. It's safe to say she must have took up some intense acting lessons after filming this.But let's end this on a slightly positive note. Richard Dreyfuss still did a good job. Far from his best performance but enough that stopped me from switching this off halfway through.I guess the script just fell in the wrong hands with this one.".

If this project was handled better and better use of the supporting actors this could have gone on to become a really good film.And then there's Liv Tyler's debut. Don't get too excited over that either. I think anyone watching her in this will be in for a shock. It's safe to say she must have took up some intense acting lessons after filming this.But let's end this on a slightly positive note. Richard Dreyfuss still did a good job. Far from his best performance but enough that stopped me from switching this off halfway through.I guess the script just fell in the wrong hands with this one.";

	schema:reviewBody "A good thriller with a stellar cast Richard Dreyfuss Linda Hamilton John Lithgow J.T. Walsh and Liv Tyler on her film debut a good directorBruce Beresford and one of the first screenwriting experiences of future Oscar winner Akiva Goldsman Silent Fall is a fine movie dealing with abrutal mystery murder where the only witness is an autistic kid Ben Faulkner who could reveal everything about his parents killings if he couldcommunicate or move a little from his shell of a particular world of himself. Dreyfuss plays a highly experienced psychiatrist who is contacted by hissheriff friend Walsh to get the boy's attention and find clues to solve the case with a personal trauma of his own the reluctant Dreyfuss charactertakes some time with his unconventional work practice to make contact with the kid and with such slowness another doctor Lithgow tries the use ofstrong medicine to get results and some solve everything quickly.Silent Fall works with efficiency though it's too limited to impress fans of a good whodunit. The lack of characters to build a more thrillingsuspense is astoundingly plainful because it makes everything look predictable except for the possible motive for the crimes. So if that doesn't workwhy bother watching you may ask. Simple because the dramatic elements are good enough to make you feel and understand that a higher purpose serves wellits story. It's all in the personal moments where Dreyfuss tries to make a bridge to connect with the austistic child that makes it all interesting. He has the skills and the observation power to enter the child's inner world and with that he can discover great things not just about him but also about himself.Ben Faulkner's only film performance not a trained actor by the way makes it a challenge to the veteran actor and for us viewers. His portrayal of akid with autism was spot on nuanced going from one emotion and reaction to another is a very good manner. Take their first encounter at the crime scenethe kid is yielding a bloody knife and despite an apparently frail boy who could be easily dominated never talking and just making some grunt noisesyou're already terrified. That's when the doctor handles things by finding ways to enter the kid's world and finally distract him. It's when those two aretogether creating a bond and obtained clues to the mystery that the film works brilliant  some other plot twists work as well. At some part the Rain Mentrickery goes way too much in dealing with autism but they don't fail to impress. It's just slightly overused.Now if you're still not impressed with anything of that at least give some view or recognition to the cast all greatly directed by Beresford. AlthoughLithgow and Hamilton aren't so strong because their characters are slightly pivotal to the story the newcomers Faulkner and Liv Tyler as his older sistermakes it all appealing. Tyler rose to stardom in Aerosmith videos then came this movie and not only is she stunning but her character is a deep fountainof surprises going from a sweet lovely girl to same scary extremes. And the late Mr. Walsh one of the finest character actors of all time got some timeto use his sinister and menacing looks to finally play a good guy since it's him in the role of the town's sheriff one could get easily fooled in thinkingthis man's got something to hide but we never fall thinking he's the killer.Here's a good psychogical suspense with thrills and surprises good performances and many memorable moments. It has some of all the nice elementsthat can compose a good movie with satisfactory. Non demanding audiences will have a good time watching it and some will have it as a possible favoriteon their film lists. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "I really enjoyed this film for a number of reasons. I think Katt Williams is hilarious all by himself and was a great person to cast as choir director. I thought the plot was not as generic as most theftbased plots that hit Hollywood. I thought the transitions that happened as the film developed were fun to watch. Overall I thought the movie was really good.If you are trying to decide whether or not you want to go see this movie consider this as you make your decision. First the film is stereotypical. The main characters live in and attend church in a run down community exposed to crime drugs and other stereotypical things you expect to find in a stereotypical community overrun with stereotypical people who are stereotypically Black or Hispanic. Second the film is funny. Things that are funny to people who understand the complexities and realities of being Black will realize this people who do not understand will find it challenging to find the comedy. Third the film will not be an Oscar nominee. The movie was not so well shot scripted edited or presented that you will see it up for major awards. That being said a number of movies come out every day that are entertaining but are not awardwinning and we watch them because we want to be entertained. This is another one of those films. So if you want to be entertained you understand the positive and negative inner workings of Black society and you do not mind viewing a film that displays both stereotypes and truths about the way Black people live move and have their being this movie is for you.".

Most of you who rate these movies based on it's cinematic beauty and character never take the time to view it for what it was meant. These movies are all great in my book one being because they are things that I have seen since I was 8 years old and still see today so I can relate to them. Which is what they are stories that are told for the enjoyment of people who can relate to them and to show those who cannot the reality that these characters lived in relation to real life situations.But since we have a lot of people who were born with silver spoons in their mouth trying to make their voices be the base of the percussion line they can and will never see it that way. Every time they watch a movie their looking at the camera detail the acting to be 10 stars the story to be about white houses with picket fences and a happy ending under a rainbow while we who relate to the story always think the movie was great because it speaks for us it lets everyone who see's it know that these things do happen regardless of it's budget and cinematography.So to all you bad movie critics My advice to you is to stop watching these movies that you cannot relate to or just stop being a critic and just keep it to yourself.Amsterdam Holland".

Boy it's even more freakish to have to watch misfits turning over a new leaf by some lonely old church ladies with ogling eyes! Absolutely a lame movie without any witty humor but with lots of unflattering stereotypical clichs to attempt at drawing out laughs and where events and characters flow and end at very predictable expectations.

In addition Cube Durell has a solid persona not varying much each film of an intelligent serious but secretly warmhearted guy a working stiff who just hasn't had the right breaks.His sidekick LeeJohn Tracy Morgan provides the feckless goofy but lovable klutz whose heart is bigger than Durell's. Beyond reasonable humor is Katt Williams' Rickey a choirmaster with loopy observations and mannerisms. The women in the congregation serve as enablers for the errant crooks and in one case as major eye candy. Most of the characters in the film are shameless stereotypes.The responsibility for this sub par comedy rests with writer director David E. Talbert whose more that a dozen successful plays with heavy social themes remind of the success Tyler Perry has had with a similar profile. But Talbert lacks Perry's refinement of style and substance that deftly mixes broad comedy with social concerns. Talbert may never reach the success of Perry but he should keep trying because social comedy is a powerful part of our popular culture.".

Or better yet why don't you come out with a new album instead of scaring us with your crummy acting ability.Tracy Morgan and Kat Williams It's back to standup gigs again!";

The strongest messages are about desperation redemption salvation and... love of thyself. The whole church robbery is just the backdrop and nothing more. People of all walks of life have escapes from whatever and will continually find to them no matter. The film is not preachy nor pushy. It's really very motivating if you've ever been frustrated with any given situation and how yow canwill impact it's outcome. Talbert  the cast's intention seemingly was to take one bad outlook on a few situations and tell a story of how it can be changed with a lot of hope and just letting go.Durrell  LeeJohn both have issues as seen but so do the other people throughout this film. Each church member andor viewer could leave with a better outlook on life as well with the mere reevaluation of values. The film's flow delivery and continuity are almost 99.8 on cue. Sometime if you see someone else's pain it can make you reexamine your own. If you plan to see this film please do this. Clear your brain of all preconceived notions of the cast the director anyone's reviews and of things like racism church politricks and social issues. Doing this may give you a whole new perspective of your own life. If you enter in bias you will leave in bias. What a waste of your time  money huh?".

There are some good in the hood laughs but not worth to remember. I personally think that Ice Cube can do better and he can achieve something more great the Friday series.His acting is getting better and better but he should try to change the plot of his movies or maybe a drastic change in his character.At all this movie production is not something amazingbut this is not its main mission. It's just a good comedy that can waste your time without wasting its limit. By the way its worth nothing the fact that there are some really funny characters that are really moving the thing in this production. Like the chore director for example or the priest.Actually this is the main element that makes me rate the movie at a more high score. It seems that almost everything was halfbaked the plot is good but could have been better and the actors a re funnybut could be funnier.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me first start off by saying this movie kept true to the words of the bible and kept the sabbath day holy as this movies plot was riddled with them. If you wondering why I have HA. as my summary title that is because at the time i read that they called this movie a comedy under genre. This movie has about as much comedy as Roots and no I did not find Roots remotely funny. So first let me start with the plot. This story is completely messed up. First off lets start with something i noticed off the bat while watching the movie. A man in the movie spoilers is blind and cleans the church at nights. This doesn't bother as much as the point that in one part of the movie he is able to walk by a gun within mere inches of his face and not notice it yet later in the movie is able to find a bag of money which no one else can. Another thing in the movie that i only realized happened afterwards was that two characters were completely missing for half the movie. In one scene there is the character of a woman in a greenish shirt with black dots on her shirt played by comedian Rickey Smiley who is a man. Her character another character who is sitting next to her in a church meeting they are having completely disappear within minutes. The director didn't even bother to show where they had gone. Another thing that i hated about this movie was the acting. Ice Cubes performance rivals Clitista Flockhart's performance when she stared in Ally McFeal. Not only were his drama scenes unconvincing they were the funniest parts of this movie not really a good thing. Another thing that bothered me was Tracy Morgan and Katt Williams. They are put in the movie for comedic relief and do not deliver. They act in this movie exactly the same way the acted in previous movies they were in such as Who's your Caddy? or Gone with the Wind. By now i hope you noticed that i hated this movie. The acting ability is equal to that of someone in a elementary school play the plot has more holes than a pasta drainer and the jokes aren't present. Im just hoping they called this movie First Sunday for some other reason than to open the possibilities for a Second Sunday. I would recommend this movie to no one unless you are a amateur in the movie industry whether it be a director actor or even producer and want to know what not to do. In that case this is a good movie to watch as i shows how not to act nor how to direct a movie. If you aren't one of mentioned people Stay Away!!!.".

Talbert  Cast Ice Cube Tracey Morgan Katt Williams Chi McBride Malinda Williams Here is a comedy that is both very funny yet also shows sides of the Christian faith that are usually withheld due to the industry's intimidation of anything spiritual that may bare facts. It regards two cousins whom attend their first Sunday service with robbery in mind. Ice Cube plays a single father who loses his job and hopes not to lose his son. Tracey Morgan plays his cousin whom gets into trouble with a gang when he loses stolen wheelchairs. Desperate they decide to rob a Church. Director David E. Talbert brings some positive themes to this otherwise formula story. Cube brings a longing for his son and a realization that God sees everything. Morgan delivers many laughs in his constant screwups but learns a thing or two about Christian charity and love. Katt Williams steals scenes as a choir conductor even though without him the role might have sunk into conventions. Chi McBride as the Pastor brings authority and the ability to use alternative thinking in dealing with this dilemma. Malinda Williams plays what appears to be a romantic interest. She is a member of the church and attempts to reason with Ice Cube during dealings with an air conditioner. The result is a well made comedy with a joyous message of forgiveness and whom can be the bigger criminals. Score 8   10".

It's not original at all and in terms of being a comedy did little more than make me smile at a line or two. But it is rather harmless and it does try to have a positive message. Frankly I think the writerdirector was trying to imitate Tyler Perry and did so rather poorly. There's even a character in one scene that appears to be a male actor impersonating an older female though the character mysteriously disappears with no explanation. All in all I wouldn't recommend this but if you're looking for something to watch with the kids they might enjoy it and won't come away traumatized.".

LeeJohn is a goofy manchild who doesn't even have an idea of when his birthday is.

	schema:reviewBody "Really fun movie with a tone and style all its own. It has the same zippy sitcom character of the set which is its main stage and the comedic acting is often over the top. Yet it drives through some very subtle and deep ideas about what makes a celebrity tick the price culture extracts from its most ballyhooed figures and the scars divorce and drink can leave on those with the smoothest of surfaces.The secret to this film's success is O'Toole who gives up some of his most intimate and affecting moments on screen and intersperses them with assoverelbow feats of physical schtick that would make a Ritz Brother proud. What a shock we never saw much else from him after this tour de force. Richard Benjamin did go on to direct other films like Shoot The Moon but he never managed to get it all absolutely right the way he did here. It's so noteperfect from the opening shot of midtown Manhattan 1954 with the cars outfits and bustle all coming together beneath the strains of Les Paul and Mary Ford's How High The Moon into a tight closeup of Benjy Stone carrying a cardboard cutout of his hero Alan Swann through an uncaring jostling crowd.I almost wish they could have made a sitcom featuring the King Kaiser crew with of course Joseph Balogna Bill Macy Adolph Green and the rest all reprising their roles in a kind of Remember WENNstyle show. O what roads left untravelled. Balogna is so good managing to carry off his Sid Caesarinspired role with the same kind of aplomb that made the original Caesar early television's most dynamic and celebrated comedy performer. There's a nice scene early on where Stone sticks up for a prone Swann by telling Kaiser he can't fire the swashbuckler. You're a big star now and I'm sure you always will be Benjy says. But suppose and I know it will never happen you end up like this. I hope nobody does to you what you're doing to him. Of course Caesar did end up like this strung out on substanceuse problems that derailed his post50s career and knowing that gives the scene both funny and tensionfilled a certain undertone of poignancy for those in the know.Mark LinnBaker could have taken it down a notch or two and the Brooklyn idyll was to die for and not in a good way. I'd like to know how the hell I'm supposed to lock lips with the woman of my dreams by stuffing my face with Chinese food and showing her old movies but I don't think my repeated viewings have helped my love life much. It has given me many hours of pleasure though. This is one film that keeps on giving. With lines like Plastered? So are some of the finest erections in Europe These must be his drinking socks and Tongue...Death how can it do anything less?".

Both onscreen and off the audience is spellbound in the midst of the slapstick as these two seniorcitizen actors seize the screen for the duration of their waltz.Even more compelling is an important scene later in the movie in which Swann makes a quick trip to visit a young daughter whom he hasn't seen in years. He watches her from the car but can't bring himself to get out and speak to her.  The scene is played completely without dialogue.  With the camera focused tightly on the warring emotions which play across O'Toole's face no dialogue is necessary.

	schema:reviewBody "This was a very funny comedy set in the New York City of 195455 and involving the likes of three or four figures that normally did not have much in common though three were in the entertainment field and they would occasionally or almost occasionally work together. The fourth was less funny but would in his own way be as much a figure of historical interest even more so since he vanished.In 1954 live television was the major part of the nightly line up of shows especially variety shows. And the leading one of the day was Sid Caesar's YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS with it's skillful blending of musical numbers and high comedy  satire skits. Even today years after most of the shows have vanished except for those on kinescope they remain legendary. Caesar had for awhile Mel Brooks working as a writer on his show. He also on one occasion planned to have Errol Flynn appear as a guest. Flynn did variety shows occasionally  he once appeared on Steve Allen's show spoofing TO TELL THE TRUTH he was one of three people claiming to be Flynn one of the others being an overly confident Don Knotts wearing a little mustache. The story about Flynn's near appearance with Caesar was not as pleasant  he decided to take a powder at the last moment and did not show up for the final taping.Based on that story we have this film wherein Flynn becomes Alan Swann swashbuckling hero of films of yore. Swann is to appear on THE KING KAISER SHOW with it's star Joe Bologna. Bologna is as mercurial and difficult as Caesar supposedly was and when upset at some comments made by Brook's film version Benjy Stone Marc LynnBaker he appoints Stone to keep an eye on the notoriously tipsy and unreliable Swann to make sure he shows up for the show's rehearsals and final production.The addition of Jimmy Hoffa is interesting to this mix. The teamster boss was not really well known in 1954 his predecessor Dave Beck was more notorious but Hoffa's career can be shifted a few years to fit in. For the purposes of the plot there has been a weekly segment of the show Kaiser insists on it showing a substantial public spirit here that is just not evident elsewhere spoofing the thieving union racketeer here named Karl Rojeck  Cameron Mitchell. Rojeck only physically appears in one confrontation sequence with Kaiser in Kaiser's offices He is a nononsense humorless gangster and his eyetoeye confrontation with Kaiser is memorable. It ends with him grabbing the oversized homburg hat that Kaiser uses for his costume as his own and leaving the meeting with a definite threat in his voice. But although Rojeck the character never reappears his ominous shadow follows the movie with late deliveries of supplies to the show and with accidents almost befalling Kaiser and his associates.As the movie progresses we concentrate mostly on Benjy's growing friendship with Alan Swann. Yes he drinks and womanizes too much but he does show the young writer what is worthwhile about living and he even blends in with Benjy's family his mother Lainie Kazan and her second husband and Benjy's uncles and aunts. In one scene Swann is his charming self with them at a family dinner on Eastern Parkway.Alan turns out to be a fairly complex figure  he realizes his glamorous image is not at all like his real flawed self. And he knows he is selfish at times. But he is also genuinely timid about one creature the little daughter he barely knows who lives in Connecticut. This is his achilles heel and it makes the audience realize that for all the glamor and fame he is not a happy man. How Alan with Benjy's help pulls himself together and shows he can live up to his image is the heart of the movie. Peter O'Toole gives his best comic performance in this movie abetted by LinnBaker Bologna Selma Diamond whose face glows when O'Toole shows her what he has to make a woman happy Kazan Bill Macy and the rest of the film. It turns out to be one's favorite movie about that favorite year.".

The fourth was less funny but would in his own way be as much a figure of historical interest even more so since he vanished.In 1954 live television was the major part of the nightly line up of shows especially variety shows. And the leading one of the day was Sid Caesar's YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS with it's skillful blending of musical numbers and high comedy  satire skits.

O'Toole has a tax problem and he's agreed to do an appearance on a top rated television comedy show of the Fifties to satisfy Uncle Sam's lien on his future income and to avoid deportation. But by now he's a boozy shadow of his former self and the star of the show Joseph Bologna assigns his most junior writer Mark LinnBaker to keep him in reasonable condition to perform.As it turns out it means bringing O'Toole into his world which is Jewish Brooklyn of the Fifties something I'm somewhat familiar with myself. Baker and O'Toole become a marvelous comedy duo themselves here. I'm surprised they did not team to do a whole lot more films than this. O'Toole's performance succeeds on a lot of levels. Yes it's pretty funny sidesplittingly funny at times. But there's also an element of sadness in it as well. You see in film clips the man O'Toole once was and now only commands attention by making a public spectacle of himself at times. I knew someone like that in my life one who hardly had any kind of a career but also HAD to be the center of attention at all times and usually did it by getting riotously drunk and acting abominably dumb. He had a certain charm and could get away with it a lot though not the way O'Toole does.Based on Mel Brooks's recollections of having to work with Errol Flynn the film lets you know it's Flynn were remembering. Note the almost step by step choreographed duel recreation of Flynn and Basil Rathbone's final duel from The Adventures of Robin Hood. Joseph Bologna is great as the egotistical comedy star and the Brooklyn vignette has a great performance by Lainie Kazan as Baker's most Jewish mother and Lou Jacobi as his most Jewish uncle.Still it's what goes on and what's between O'Toole and Baker that makes My Favorite Year an all time comedy classic.".

Peter O'Toole's delivery is unabelievable especially since I don't usually associate his name with this kind of comedy. It was hysterical!

So tonight I took out my favorite Peter O'Toole film  this one  and enjoyed watching it once again.I know that most people point to Lawrence Of Arabia because of its scope and indeed it is a fine film...although not one of my favorites although O'Toole is brilliant in it. But let's not forget that he was nominated for an Academy Award for this film as well.Why is this my favorite O'Toole film? Because it's nice to see an actor not taking himself quite so seriously. And most of O'Toole's films were damned serious. This is rollicking fun and as O'Toole' character points out early in the film Death is easy comedy is hard. And indeed that is so true. Comedy is tough! And that shows O'Toole's brilliance all the more because we are used to seeing him in dramas. So I feel that here he is at his very best challenged by being an actor who is acting funny rather than a comedian doing what comedians do.The script too is brilliant. It seems to be based loosely on when Errol Flynn guested on Sid Caesar's comedy show...not that there were the fireworks that are portrayed here in this film. But as hilarious as it is it's also a very touching film. A washed alcoholic actor who can still buckle his swash. An estranged father who hasn't the courage to talk to his daughter. And a young man given the responsibility of managing an actor gone wild...and their adventures in Brooklyn and at a dinner party. It isn't just a funny movie. It's got real heart mixed in with the laughs...and I do laugh out loud when I watch this film.Mark LinnBaker an actor I've never seen in any other movie or television show although I know he has been in several is just right as the young studio aide whose job it is to manage O'Toole's character. Joseph Bologna is great as the Caesarish comedian. I enjoyed seeing the wonderful singer Lainie Kazan as LinnBaker's mother. And Lou Jacobi as the uncle. I was very interested to see Adolph Green  the famous composer  as the television show's director. And Selma Diamond as the wardrobe woman. And Gloria Stuart  as in Titanic  as a lady at a nightclub.But Peter O'Toole on this sad day for your friends and family and fans you made me laugh out loud once again. Thank you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mel Brooks wrote this based on his experiences working as a junior comedy writer on Sid Caesar's Your show of shows. The first time I saw this movie I laughed from beginning to end. Mark Lynn Baker plays the Benji Stone the young Brooks whose real name is Stoneberg. He has the right innocence for role. He gives a great performance. But this movie is Peter O'Toole's. He plays a larger then life Earol Flynn character. He is drunk and about to be thrown out of the country by the IRS. He teaches young Stone the difference between the man and the star and how stardom sometimes overtakes the man's own identity. One of high point of the movie is when Baker takes O'toole have dinner in his mother's apartment in Brooklyn. O'toole also coaches Baker on getting the girl of his dreams played by Jessica Harper. One of the great scenes has Mark Lynn Baker trying to teach Harper how to tell a joke. All this takes place with the backdrop of late 1950's television. A time where TV was still a novelty.

	onyx:emotionText "Mel Brooks wrote this based on his experiences working as a junior comedy writer on Sid Caesar's Your show of shows. The first time I saw this movie I laughed from beginning to end. Mark Lynn Baker plays the Benji Stone the young Brooks whose real name is Stoneberg. He has the right innocence for role. He gives a great performance. But this movie is Peter O'Toole's. He plays a larger then life Earol Flynn character. He is drunk and about to be thrown out of the country by the IRS. He teaches young Stone the difference between the man and the star and how stardom sometimes overtakes the man's own identity. One of high point of the movie is when Baker takes O'toole have dinner in his mother's apartment in Brooklyn. O'toole also coaches Baker on getting the girl of his dreams played by Jessica Harper. One of the great scenes has Mark Lynn Baker trying to teach Harper how to tell a joke. All this takes place with the backdrop of late 1950's television. A time where TV was still a novelty. Every scene makes you at least smile and most make you laugh out loud. Richard Benjiman show great skill as a director even though this one of his earliest films. I guess all those years as an actor paid off behind the camera as well.";

	schema:reviewBody "First Errol Flynn was the consummate Hollywood action hero and then he was the consummate Hollywood hasbeen. The substance abuse the wrecked relationships the legal scandals by the end of his life he was a guy who needed a lot of rehabilitating. My Favorite Year is a posthumous rehabilitation of Flynn and it is also a sweet and funny tall tale about what his redemption might have looked like had it happened during his lifetime. Flynn's actual appearance on the 1950s variety show where Mel Brooks was a young writer came and went without incident but in My Favorite Year that forgettable television moment is reimagined as one huge crazy boozy incident worthy of Peter O'Toole in his hellraising days.

	onyx:emotionText "First Errol Flynn was the consummate Hollywood action hero and then he was the consummate Hollywood hasbeen. The substance abuse the wrecked relationships the legal scandals by the end of his life he was a guy who needed a lot of rehabilitating. My Favorite Year is a posthumous rehabilitation of Flynn and it is also a sweet and funny tall tale about what his redemption might have looked like had it happened during his lifetime. Flynn's actual appearance on the 1950s variety show where Mel Brooks was a young writer came and went without incident but in My Favorite Year that forgettable television moment is reimagined as one huge crazy boozy incident worthy of Peter O'Toole in his hellraising days. O'Toole infuses all of Flynn standin Alan Swann's lines every flourish of his hands every drunken stagger with a precise mixture of charm and pain.The story is mostly a buddy comedy of the sort that thrives on the emotional closeness of its characters.

	schema:headline " Nothing to Do with the Terence Hill Trinity but Entertaining.";
	schema:reviewBody "Writer  director Alfonso Balczar's Spaghetti western Il ritorno di Clint il solitario is marginally better than his previous oater Clint el solitario. Basically Clint el solitario qualified as a rehash of George Stevens' classic Alan Ladd western Shane where a legendary gunfighter toiled as a day laborer for a sodbuster and wound up defending his family against predatory cattlemen. Il ritorno di Clint il solitario recycles the formula that Clint el solitario borrowed and makes some changes that generate greater tension and at least one major surprise that should leave hellbentforleather Italian western fans astonished. Along the way Balczar and scenarists Giovanni Simonelli of Any Gun Can Play and Enzo Doria appropriate some narrative ideas from Sergio Leone that didn't appear in Clint el solitario. Indeed this Spanish produced sagebrusher looks like it was lensed on a shoestring budget but its threadbare production values actually enhance the authenticity of this frontier western. Sure the story is an anthology of clichs with stereotypes circling them in predictable fashion but Balczar does a competent of job of keeping the action going at full steam. Anybody who sees this western knows what is going to happen except perhaps for the eleven hour revelation that is pretty incredible. Fistful of Dollars composer Ennio Morricone provides a taut atmospheric orchestral score that distinguishes this horse opera and the great Klaus Kinski is a definite asset as a greedy bounty hunter who would rather bring them in dead than alive. Virtually every scene has been tweaked inIl ritorno di Clint il solitario so that it is a ruthless banker who wants the land belonging to the ranchers and farmers because the railroad is coming through and he intends to cash in on it.Although he is called 'Trinity' the George Martin protagonist shares nothing in common with Terence Hill's comical gunslinger. Furthermore nobody calls him 'Clint' in this quasisequel. Joe Harrison's brother died at the hands of a killer after his wedding and Joe gunned down the killer. Six years has passed and Harrison has had to abandon his family his wife Norma Harrison Marina Malfatti of Savage Guns his oldest son Jimmy Harrison Augusto Pescarini of The Ugly Ones and his young daughter Betty Susanna Atkinson because gunmen are in pursuit of him. Worse he has been imprisoned and he breaks out. Early he guns down the Murdock brothers. Not long afterward a lethal cigarsmoking bounty hunter Scott Klaus Kinski of For A Few Dollars More learns about the five thousand dollar bounty on Trinity's head but doesn't care for the fact that he has to bring him back alive to get the money. Meanwhile Trinity rides off to a town near the vegetable farm that Norma has bought from the treacherous banker. The banker has three slimy gunslingers working for him that constantly try to provoke the settlers into violence and badger them about selling their land.The banker Mr. Scranton Francisco Jos Huetos of Hands of a Gunman isn't as sneaky as Walter Barnes was in Clint el solitario. Scranton doesn't manipulate the law the way Barnes' villain did. Nevertheless Scranton's men single out one rancher and frame him for a bank robbery. They enter the bank late one evening and shoot the guard holding a pillow against his chest like 'Angel Eyes' did in Leone's The Good the Bad and The Ugly. Afterward they capture Brandell Luis Ponciado and frame him for the robbery. The sheriff locks him up and the villains plan to hang him without a trial. Trinity intervenes to keep his hottempered son from interfering. Brandell's son dies in a showdown trying to free his father.Meantime Scott has ridden into town and is curious about Trinity because he remembers seeing him somewhere earlier. Not only must Trinity abide by Norma's antiviolence stance and bury his guns as well as avoid trouble but he also must not give into temptation and shoot it out with the bad guys because Scott is monitoring his every move like a hawk. Eventually as in Clint el solitario Trinity challenges the guntoting villains to prove themselves in a fistfight and they come close to destroying the saloon. This fight isn't as rugged as the one in Clint el solitario. The connection with Clint el solitario in Il ritorno di Clint il solitario is Balczar's use of footage from the previous western when the hero and the boy rounded up a young colt. Near the end Scott orders a wanted poster of Trinity to confirm his identity and then moves in to take him into custody. At this point the villains are really getting down and dirty. Il ritorno di Clint il solitario is a predictable but entertaining western.".

	schema:headline " Kinski And Morricone Save This Otherwise Unsatisfying Spaghetti Western";
	schema:reviewBody "Alfonso Balczar's Il Ritorno Di Clint Il Solitario aka. The Return Of Clint The Stranger is a Spaghetti Western that is mediocre at best with a storyline that is normally found in American 'Good Guys vs. Bad Guys' Westerns. The movie is however saved by two geniuses Klaus Kinski who once again delivers a great performance in an excellent role the only great role in this otherwise below average film and Ennio Morricone who delivers the score. The score is far from one of Morricone's strokes of genius basically one of the scores where you know Morricone just did them for the money and didn't invest too much time but it is still capable of partially saving the movie and making it a lot better. This movie's highlight however is the bounty hunter character played by the brilliant Kinski who is basically the only typical Spaghetti Western character in this.The main character of Clint played by George Martin is basically a typical 'good guy' who wants to return to family life after five years of fleeing the law. Five years after killing his brother's murderer Clint comes back to his hometown which he finds terrorized by a gang of unscrupulous criminals who want to steal the land from poor local farmers. Furthermore a mysterious bounty hunter named Scott Kinski has been following Clint for the reward on his head.This movie's storyline is not too original and the performances are not too impressive either. George Martin may fit in his role and his leading performance is not necessarily bad but he is not very charismatic and his character is far away from the antihero characters my fellow Spaghetti Western fans love. Klaus Kinski's character on the other hand is the only true Spaghetti Western character in this and what a Spaghetti Western character he is. Seeing Kinski play a cynical longhaired cigarsmoking bounty hunter in a poncho is a true highlight of this movie and probably the only aspect which really makes The Return Of Clint The Stranger worth watching. This particular role however is such a great aspect that I recommend it for every fan of Spaghetti Westerns even if just for this role and nothing else.All in all Il Ritorno Di Clint Il Solitario is a Spaghetti Western that would be rather unsatisfying if it wasn't for Morricone's score and mainly for the great Klaus Kinski and the great role he plays. Therefore it is certainly worth watching. 510".

	onyx:emotionText "Alfonso Balczar's Il Ritorno Di Clint Il Solitario aka. The Return Of Clint The Stranger is a Spaghetti Western that is mediocre at best with a storyline that is normally found in American 'Good Guys vs. Bad Guys' Westerns. The movie is however saved by two geniuses Klaus Kinski who once again delivers a great performance in an excellent role the only great role in this otherwise below average film and Ennio Morricone who delivers the score. The score is far from one of Morricone's strokes of genius basically one of the scores where you know Morricone just did them for the money and didn't invest too much time but it is still capable of partially saving the movie and making it a lot better. This movie's highlight however is the bounty hunter character played by the brilliant Kinski who is basically the only typical Spaghetti Western character in this.The main character of Clint played by George Martin is basically a typical 'good guy' who wants to return to family life after five years of fleeing the law. Five years after killing his brother's murderer Clint comes back to his hometown which he finds terrorized by a gang of unscrupulous criminals who want to steal the land from poor local farmers. Furthermore a mysterious bounty hunter named Scott Kinski has been following Clint for the reward on his head.This movie's storyline is not too original and the performances are not too impressive either. George Martin may fit in his role and his leading performance is not necessarily bad but he is not very charismatic and his character is far away from the antihero characters my fellow Spaghetti Western fans love.

	schema:reviewBody "This is the sequel to Clint el solitario 1967 again with George Martin and done by director Alfonso Balczar who also uses the synonym George Martin sometimes.It's a mediocre italowestern with a typical american familywestern storyline Clint who killed the murderer of his brother in the first movie and therefore was imprisoned escapes from there and wants to get back to his family. His wife and the 2 children had to flee from their home and live on a farm in Texas now. She accepts Clint as a helping hand on the farm just if he lays down his weapons and swears off violence. But soon unscrupulous gangsters want to force them to sell their land and farm. And a headhunter is coming for Clint. So here it goes...If you don't like children as important characters of a movie because it often makes them childish stay away. The acting is second stage professional nothing special everything mediocre... But this is more the american style of western mainly because of the storyline. I can't stand heroes of a Western who don't have a gun on their belly all the time better out of their belly. And here you have this family and farmcrap most of the time. And the wife demanding No Violence!  or you cannot stay!  Phhaaa!Of course it's a trashy italoversion of it with a cheap and dirty setting really evil and disgusting baddies some bloody senseless killing and some good punchfights. And there are some cool bloodred flashbacks to the first part. AND  YOU  HAVE KLAUS KINSKI  of course he is great the 100 uncaring headhunter an invidious mien but always above everything long blond hair smoking cigar permanently  cool as always! In this movie his character has quite a leading role. And I bought this DVD  which was released as Ein Einsamer kehrt zurck in Germany  because I love ItaloWestern and Klaus Kinski. So it was o.k.! The atmosphere as you could expect it from an ItaloWestern is nothing special most of what you can describe as atmosphere is done by Klaus Kinski. Everything's mediocre  except Klaus Kinski of course!I was wondering no one commented this movie as it has Klaus Kinski in a leading role and Ennio Morricone did the music.".

	schema:headline " Word of advise. Don't mix spaghetti with traditional American western";
	schema:reviewBody "Unless of course you want to see something like this. Return Of Clint The Stranger tries to combine these two subgenres in one movie. Instead it actually combines problems that have plagued both genres and in the end what we get is a halfbaked unpolished film mixed with the already overused American dream type story.Return Of Clint The Stranger is a story about a man named Clint whom after avenging the death of his brother and sisterinlaw is forced to leave his family and go into hiding. He returns 5 five years later to them in the hopes that he can once again be accepted. Of course no story is complete without the villains and here we have them in the form of a greedy banker who is trying to drive Clint's family off their own lands.I can almost guess what director Alfonso Balczar was trying to do. He wanted to deviate from the established persona of the Italian western. He was trying to give this movie a bigger sense of depth by adding more developed characters. The problem is they are not particularly interesting in fact they are annoying clichs of the same characters you might see on any of the preLeone era American western. Clint himself is a very uncharismatic protagonist. We see that through his actions when he is trying to protect his family. At one point he tries bribing several of the henchman hired by the banker but instead he gets hit in the head and they steal his money. He also unknowingly helps in causing the death of one his son's friends. And while some of these faults could have helped creating a more complex filled with guilt character Balczar fails to tap on them. Instead he continues to present the story in a monotonous way Clint shows no visible regret of his actions and remains in the same passive mood. The entire story is mash of ideas that lack a proper realization. Klaus Kinsky's character for example could have been more strongly implemented into the plot instead of just throwing him this shallow role of a bounty hunter. The story's conclusion wasn't particularly memorable the showdown between Clint and the banker's men wasn't all to great lacking the ingenuity of the better Italian westerns.This movie can't brag about production values either. It's cheap sleazy and while that could be forgiven in most westerns of the genre simply because they aim to entertain here it helps to booster every other weak point in the film. This tried to be something more than pure entertainment. Tried and failed. I will pass on commenting on the acting simply because the version I watched was dubbed in Bulgarian. The music is a total lackluster it lacks the punch of some of Morricone's earlier work and there is no doubt he did the score only for the money.Return Of Clint The Stranger is not a good movie. It tries to add something new and fresh to the genre but it fails. It fails so much that it becomes hardly watchable on any standard.".

	onyx:emotionText "Unless of course you want to see something like this. Return Of Clint The Stranger tries to combine these two subgenres in one movie. Instead it actually combines problems that have plagued both genres and in the end what we get is a halfbaked unpolished film mixed with the already overused American dream type story.Return Of Clint The Stranger is a story about a man named Clint whom after avenging the death of his brother and sisterinlaw is forced to leave his family and go into hiding. He returns 5 five years later to them in the hopes that he can once again be accepted. Of course no story is complete without the villains and here we have them in the form of a greedy banker who is trying to drive Clint's family off their own lands.I can almost guess what director Alfonso Balczar was trying to do. He wanted to deviate from the established persona of the Italian western. He was trying to give this movie a bigger sense of depth by adding more developed characters. The problem is they are not particularly interesting in fact they are annoying clichs of the same characters you might see on any of the preLeone era American western. Clint himself is a very uncharismatic protagonist. We see that through his actions when he is trying to protect his family. At one point he tries bribing several of the henchman hired by the banker but instead he gets hit in the head and they steal his money. He also unknowingly helps in causing the death of one his son's friends. And while some of these faults could have helped creating a more complex filled with guilt character Balczar fails to tap on them. Instead he continues to present the story in a monotonous way Clint shows no visible regret of his actions and remains in the same passive mood. The entire story is mash of ideas that lack a proper realization. Klaus Kinsky's character for example could have been more strongly implemented into the plot instead of just throwing him this shallow role of a bounty hunter. The story's conclusion wasn't particularly memorable the showdown between Clint and the banker's men wasn't all to great lacking the ingenuity of the better Italian westerns.This movie can't brag about production values either. It's cheap sleazy and while that could be forgiven in most westerns of the genre simply because they aim to entertain here it helps to booster every other weak point in the film. This tried to be something more than pure entertainment. Tried and failed. I will pass on commenting on the acting simply because the version I watched was dubbed in Bulgarian. The music is a total lackluster it lacks the punch of some of Morricone's earlier work and there is no doubt he did the score only for the money.Return Of Clint The Stranger is not a good movie. It tries to add something new and fresh to the genre but it fails. It fails so much that it becomes hardly watchable on any standard.";

There are many audio works about the TKKG gang a group of kids solving mysteries and usually running into gangsters but this is the first of so far 2 times that they also made it to the big screen at theaters. I would say that the quality here is not good enough to recommend this to anybody except children but why would one say something like that? Don't you want your kids to grow up and watch quality stuff instead of forgettable movies. II know I would if I was a father or a child again. This film is about caves castles and criminals and certainly has a touch of history attached to it as well. But overall it is just a pretty disappointing outcome. The performances are overthetop mostly in a fairly bad way and the script is not any better and rarely achieves the tension and excitements it goes for so desperately. The writers are the Kalmuczaks and their work here does not make me curious about other projects. Then again it looks as if they did not work on anything significant really other than TKKG. The director is Ulrich Knig and I believe that this one here is weaker than his work on Hatschipuh and much weaker than his work on Pumuckl. The cast does not really include any big names and all the child actors or almost all have not pursued acting careers. The grownup actors include many names that are already dead which is a bit sad but not too surprising as this film is already a quarter of a century old. I don't think it has aged well and there are many superior projects in terms of kids entertainment from Germany these days. Don't watch.".

It's all pretty ingenious.John Goodman plays a cartoonlike role a role that is generally funny to watch. The cast has a mixture of American and English actors with a setting of 1940s Britain. I first saw this on VHS and then later on DVD which was improvement not only videowise but audio too as it somehow went from mono to surround sound. This might be considered a kids movie but a lot of the humor is more adultoriented.".

As I expected this is more of a comic adventure film a pretty typical children's film for the time as opposed to the serious and beautiful Ghibli version. I have no idea which is closer to the source material I'd actually bet the 1997 version is the other one is way too Ghibliesque not to have been heavily changed. As it is the 1997 version is a halfway decent children's films. Not good not bad. If I were a kid I think I'd enjoy it. It stars John Goodman and Jim Broadbent so it at least has something going for it. The family is pretty similar to the Ghibli version except for they also have a son Tom Felton. Felton and Flora Newbigin who plays Arrietty get separated from their parents Broadbent and Celia Imrie when the house they live in is set to be bulldozed by evil land developer is there any other kind? John Goodman. There's no seriousness here. It's all just loud adventure type stuff as the borrower children outsmart Goodman at every turn he could probably very easily defeat his nemeses here if he would just avoid those comic pauses every time they're about to get him. I'm surprised Newbigin didn't go onto anything better. She's a pretty good juvenile actress. I don't think this film was very successful. I don't ever remember it existing I was in college at the time so I wouldn't have had any interest. The special effects aren't too bad. The story was adapted just five years previous with Ian Holm starring in the Jim Broadbent role.".

Celia Imrie isn't bad as Homily but she's no match for Penelope Wilton. The special effects aren't too bad for the year and few of them scream 'obvious CGI' like so many Hollywood films today.So where did it go wrong? Well the attempts to update the story for a modern American audience is a good start. The setting is some ridiculous 'netherworld' which mixes modernday technology with 1950sera Britain and America. It's ludicrous. Goodman's villain is poorly shoehorned into the storyline and the subject of numerous fat jokes. Really? Is it right for a film to be teaching kids to constantly insult people due to their weight? The characters are badly written the dumb humour consists of farting dogs and the like and the whole thing has been dumbed down massively and lost the magic of the original.

It has some odd inconsistencies for the more critical viewer  mainly the fact that it is an unequivocally British story set in an unequivocally British town yet some of the main characters and some other aspects are clearly and inexplicably American  but those quirks needn't detract from the excellent script and characterization. It's a good film to rewatch with the finger on the pause button of the video remote control  the details of the Borrowers' home and equipment are fun to spot. Don't do that the first time though. It's also notable for the first teaming of Mark Williams Jim Broadbent and Tom Felton all leading characters here as well as in certain later and distinctly betterknown films.".

Dad Pod Clock has kept his family at home so daughter Arietty and son Peagreen have no idea of a wider world they only know that the first rule of being a Borrower is not to be seen by the big people. But Arietty is not only seen but captured by young Pete Lender which coincides with the Lenders being forcibly and illegally evicted by wicked property developer Potter so that he can demolish their home.This film has an air about it of using the original idea I have not read the source material so I don't know and then doing its own thing with it if so it's not bad. The story fairly whizzes along with John Goodman's Potter a suitably cartoon villain just as well given the Wile E. Coyotetype retributions he suffers for his wickedness. Production design is intriguing the Borrowers world is nicely realised and the larger world is based on 1950s Britain but with many stylistic weirdnesses heavy urban industrialisation driving on the right everybody in Morris Minors mobile phones and monochrome TVs and a colour palette comprising saturated secondary colours.The cast is good and it is interesting to see a very young Tom Felton unrecognisable under corkscrew ginger wig and huge false gap teeth. Only Flora Newbigin as Arietty disappoints with some line readings which ring false.".

Characters do things like run around screech burp fall for no apparent reason tie people up and pretty much what they do in almost every other movie aimed at kids. The characters are also pretty dimwitted racous grating and even The Borrower family failed to capture my sympathy. The lady was scary the man was wooden and the kids were brats.

It's impossible to choose between Pod and Arrietty Clock but one of them takes first and the other takes runner up as to who exactly the most annoying character in the history of the universe is.

There was something about that young guy called Raymond Pickard I believe that was just absolutely magnetic. I couldn't take my eyes off of him.Anyhow this is a wonderful film in my opinion. Completely original I thought. That Disney garbage is so predictable and pointless filled with mindnumbing songs. The Borrowers is a nice refreshing breath of air for the family film genre.

This movie is all about a kid named Pete Lender who is determined to find out why all the stuff in their house keeps disappearing. He eventually finds Arrietty who is a Borrower and she explains what Borrowers do. The Lenders have to move out of their house because a mean man named Ocious Potter wants to build an apartment building in its place. The Borrowers try to go with the Lenders but the kids fall out of the truck and have to travel through the city to find the new house that is by the old church. Some of the main characters in the movie are Pete Lender Arrietty Clock Ocious P. Potter and Exterminator Jeff. My favorite character is Pete Lender because he really cares about the Borrowers and is really funny. Exterminator Jeff is on Ocious P. Potter's team at first but then wants to help Pete and the Borrowers. My favorite part in the movie is when Peagreen Clock fell out of the truck and landed in dog poop. I like that part because it was really funny and I think that a lot of people would think that was funny too. Another part I really like is when Ocious P. Potter got squirt with cheese. The Borrowers pushed the lever to squirt the cheese because he was after them. It worked and the Borrowers got away! I would recommend this movie for all ages 3 and up because there are a couple of scary parts but not too many and it is a really good movie. Reviewed by Anthony Aranda age 9 KIDS FIRST!

Django goes out to avenge his wife battling murderous and executes a singlehandedly revenge  as he shoots  ravages and kills each person involved in the killing .This meaty Western contains an interesting but well known plot  violence  shoot'em up and results to be quite entertaining  though drags at times  balancing in ups and downs . This moving Spaghetti packs noisy action  thrills  drama with exciting final . Ordinary Spaghetti Western follows the Sergio Leone wake and it is proceeded in violent style . The film packs violence  shootouts  high bodycount and it's fast moving and quite entertaining . It's a thrilling western with breathtaking confrontation between the protagonist Anthony Steffen against the heartless Chris Avram  Riccardo Pizzuti and his underlings . Anthony Steffen is fine  he ravages the screen  hit and run and kills . This movie is a lot of fun to watch . It's an acceptable story with a touch of peculiarity  some particular characters and an amazing music score . The picture is a tale of justice and revenge as a man returns home  a border little town and looks for vendetta against the wife's killers . The basic plot is typical spaghetti western fare  but what makes this movie stand out is its style . This is an exciting film plenty action  thrills fights  gundown and breathtaking outdoors from Lacio  Rome  and interiors in Elios Studios . In the picture appears Spaghetti habitual secondaries playing brief interventions such as Riccardo Pizzuti  ordinary in Terence HillSpencer movies  Giovanni Cianfriglia or Ken Wood as a henchman  Benito Stefanelli  Fortunato Arena and Simone Blondell  Demofilo Fidani's daughter  known as the Italian Ed Wood . The notorious Spaghetti actor  Anthony Steffen is good in his usual tough role .

The handsome Italianborn  actually at the Brazilian embassy in Rome  Antonio Luiz de Teff von Hoonholtz began working in films as a studio messenger for Vittorio De Sica. From there Steffen began acting in swordandsandal epics later moving onto the Western genre where he found his niche. Unlike fellow Spaghetti star Clint Eastwood however Steffen never became a top international boxoffice attraction. His acting is often accused of being wooden but in many manners is ideally suited to playing the steelyfaced gunslinger synonymous with the genre . His others successes include well liked features as Seven Dollars to Kill The last Mohican Train for Durango Gentleman Jo  Four dollars for Django Shango Arizona colt Apocalypse Joe and several others .There is plenty of action in the movie  guaranteeing some shoot'em up or stunts every few minutes. There is a very odd implementation of shots in the camera work during some particular scenes as the film approaches its climax  as in the final gunfights and the customary showdown conclusion .

Good production design creating an excellent scenario with luminous outdoors dirty and rocky landscapes under a shinning sun and fine sets . Good cinematography by Marcello Masciocchi  including a nice remastering . Great musical score by Piero Umiliani  furthermore a catching and emotive leitmotif .

Along the way he saves a man Stelio Candelli who is about to be hanged because he use to be a member of the gang of killers. The two set out to kill the bandits but there are plenty of twists and turns to follow. You can tell watching this thing that the budget was probably very small but I think this adds to the enjoyment of the film because the director has to cover up some of the cheapness with clever action and stylish twists. The film looks the low budget very well and I think this really adds to the atmosphere as well. The film is ugly mean and at times funny and this is what makes this a better than average Spaghetti Western. This was my first time seeing Steffen and he really shocked me at how good he was. He perfectly looks the part of the man wanting revenge but he also has a good comic timing in a few scenes. The greatest moment is when he's riding into a small town and runs into a prankster who likes throwing dynamite at people. Django calmly picks up the burning stick lights his cigar and throws it back at the man. Candelli is also very good in his role and the two men act very well together. There's plenty of gun battles in the film but none of them get too graphic so you could probably even show this to kids. The soundtrack by Piero Umiliani is also very good. This certainly doesn't rank up with the greatest films in the genre but it's a nice addition.".

A Man Called Django doesn't compare of course to the original Franco Nero film but is still very acceptable nonthink entertainment that keeps you watching for an hour and a half.

A year later Django Anthony Steffen comes to a small town and learns that a thief about to be hanged Carranza Stelio Candelli can identify the members of that gang so he saves his life.

Don't look for too much story here but you can expect a fair amount of style courtesy of director Edoardo Mulargia and the violence is pretty constant the body count in this thing is impressive. You can also expect a LOT of comedy in this thing thanks to writer Nino Stresa. Candelli in particular is an absolute hoot. The acting is competent all the way down the line horror fans may recognize Chris Avram from Mario Bavas' A Bay of Blood cast here as the outlaw Jeff. Esmeralda Barros adds appreciable eye candy as Lola and Donato Castellaneta is quite appealing as saloon owner Paco. Some fans of Italian Westerns may find that ultimately it gets too silly but it's undeniably very lively from start to finish and hard not to like. Steffen may not be Franco Nero but he's pretty cool in his own right and the viewer simply has to love how ingenious he is. He establishes himself as a cool customer soon after his entrance and he comes up with nifty ways to trick various bad guys. The bit with the fake arm is a showstopper. All in all this is quite agreeable and well worth a viewing. Seven out of 10.".

	schema:headline " This Spaghetti Western was a little messy but entertaining. Still this movie probably help nail the coffin on the Django craze.";
	schema:reviewBody "Designed to cash in on the success of 1966's Django this unofficial Django movie directed by Edoardo Mulargia is very unoriginal with its plot. It just carbon copy the previous film's plot. Instead of stealing gold like the last movie. Django Anthony Steffen in this film steals guns. Instead of chasing down one man he's chasing down a team of men with the help of a horse theft Carranza Stelio Candelli whom can identify the members of the gang that kill his wife. While a lot of people might think his wife was raped. Seeing multiplies copies of the film. I can clearly let this rumor to rest that she does not. Even with all that the movie plot is still pretty generic predictable and tiresome. The funny thing about this film is how little the producers seem to have a minimum knowledge of Sergio Corbucci's work on Django. While the main character in question does wear black there is nothing about his character that makes us think he is the same man as the original film. There is no iconic coffin no tombstones or crosses made for his victims and most of all no spooky or dark themes. Unless you count the hero hiding behind corpse. This movie seem to recycles more elements of the Trilogy of the Dollar by Sergio Leone than Corbucci's film series. For example the hanging scene and the music box. The acting is alright for the most part. Anthony Steffen has this unique manner to Django. Steffen looks like he could be the laboratory clone of Henry Fonda. He has that likable and engaging screen main star presence. Stelio Candelli plays up the Tucoinspired character of Carranza with grinning glee. Both Steffen and Candelli display a winning chemistry in the leads and the movie kinda works because of them. The only problem is that the movie seem to lack a good main villain. Chris Avram as the lethal Jeff and Riccardo Pizzuti as the dastardly Thompson were lackluster. The movie made them look like idiots than men that could honestly be a threat to the heroes. This movie is surprising very lighthearten. There was tons of funny silly pranks pull against the villains like the bed or fake arm scenes. Still there were some tricks that were a little unrealistic. Some good examples are the scene where he disable most of the shotguns or loosen all the bad guys' sandals. Where did he get time for that? Some scenes seem to have come out of a cartoon like the one where a guy throws a stick of dynamite in Django only to have it backfired with him half stunned fuming and with his face and clothes scorched by the blast! Is this a Looney Toons's episode or a Spaghetti Western!? Anyways there were some moments that wasn't supposed to be funny but it just comes across as hilarious due to the film low budget production like the stunt dummy being tossed over the cliff the over the top one shot kills or the editors reusing shots like the man jumping through the window during an explosion. This movie has tons of LOL moments. Note that this film came out in 1971 a time when the spaghetti western tried to reinvent itself by appealing to the comic burlesque and the absurd that came from the success of 1970's film 'They call me Trinity'. The writers for this movie was hoping to do the same with this movie but it didn't mash well due to some really unusual framing choices. A good example is how they portray saloon owner Paco Donato Castellenata. They made him into a great likable supporting character but also add dark scenes of him slapping women and being forced to gun fight. WTF! It doesn't know if it wants to be serious or be a comedy film. In terms of death toll this is one of the most violent titles of Django series. 57 out of 90 men are killed by Django. It's really overblown seeing that he just wanted to get revenge with four men. While the movie has plenty of gun fights none of them were graphic. There were a lot of scenes that go nowhere like Django eyeing Lola Esmeralda Barros while looking at a nude painting. While the luscious Esmeralda Baldi supplies some really needed eye candy. Her scenes seem a bit wasted in the film as nothing is establish between her and the leads. Another framing mistake is how a car shows up out of nowhere. The film never tells us what year is the movie event taking place. So it look out of place. The dialogue is whack as well. Bartender saying that hanging isn't a Christian way to die but tells a story about a NativeAmerican saying about souls comes out of the mouth. What? There is some confusion with the movie title as some distributors renamed as Viva Django unaware that by that title was also used by director Ferdinando Baldi for his 1968's film 'Django Prepare a Coffin. I like the great psychedelic credit sequence with Piero Umiliani's melodic score. It create a perfect musical backdrop to this enjoyably fastpaced late period spaghetti western. I didn't like the twist ending with that awkward freezeframing. It made it look like the movie was cutshort. It is curious to note that this film is the last sottoDjango in the Golden Age of Spaghetti Westerns. It is very easy to find the movie on the internet. If not there are plenty of DVDs worth checking out. Just note that some versions are not in high quality. There is a 'Django' double feature DVD from Shout FactoryTimeless Media Group features this movie and Sartana's Showdown in the West that is easily high recommendation due to the quite good transfer. Overall Eduardo Mulargia manages to put together a decent Spaghetti Western. While this movie didn't outdo the original Franco Nero's film it was still very entertaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "This spaghetti western is yet another in the seemingly endless cycle of 'Django' movies. Like the vast majority it only has a passing relevance to the original Sergio Corbucci classic and really the lead character is no more than a standard spaghetti western antihero who could essentially go under any moniker. But I have seen quite a few of the Django movies now and I have also seen quite a lot of the more runofthemill Italian westerns too and this effort is quite clearly better than most. In this one we have the title character hunting down a group of bandits who raped and killed his wife. He takes them out one by one with the help of one of their exgang members whom he saves from execution in order to gain his trust and assistance.This one has Anthony Steffen as Django and I reckon he is one of the better actors at playing this kind of role. He does elicit a certain hardnosed cool throughout and its easy getting behind him on his bloody revenge mission. Steffen also has good chemistry with Stelio Candelli who plays the Mexican bandit who partners him. The nature of the plot with its emphasis on a series of villains taken down one at a time means that the story is made up of individual segments and I think this helps pace the film quite well which is a good thing given that many spaghetti westerns can get a bit tedious as they go on. The ending also was good here too although I saw the twist ending coming a mile off I have to say  the clues are there and you have just got to spot them. Allinall though I was pleasantly surprised with this one and certainly found it to be one of the better movies from this subgenre.".

It wasn't the best movie I've seen by far but I am going over lines in my head this morning from two nights ago and still laughing.Broken Lizards Club Dread is a extremly funny movie that doesn't deserve to be bashed like it is. It is a very funny..... comedic slasher. The Jimmy Buffet rip offs and cheesy ending is exactly what Broken Lizard was aiming for and if you look at it like that many of the mistakes become funny as oposed to angering.The Final Numbers 8 out of 10.".

Let down your guard and admit that you like unnecessary nudity brutal murders and fake accents. If you didn't like super troopers you probably won't like this movie but on the same token if you didn't like super troopers you're an uptight loser with no sense of humor. This movie is flat out funny when taken for what it is so please do so.

Let's face it when a film has a character named Yu merely for Yu  You puns you know you're not dealing with any type of comic genius. But if the Broken Lizard people ever decide to leave the comedy business they may have a bright future ahead of them in the horror field. As a slasher movie Club Dread is gory and suspenseful with good kill setups and the requisite false scares. The whodunit angle is handled really well  it's virtually impossible to guess who the killer is. Also the locations are pleasant all cast members seem to be enjoying themselves and the two female leads Jordan Ladd and Brittany Daniel are too sexy for words. To be honest I would give this movie  out of 4 just for that scene on the beach where Ladd flips a guy over and then sits on top of him but since I generally liked the rest of the movie as well let's make it .".

A new batch of tourists come to Paradise Island for a week of fun and nonsobriety. However someone has started killing off the workers at the club and the other workers have to catch him and stop other people from knowing about it.Without giving away any spoilers I can tell you this it was great. Broken Lizard has somehow made a movie that's insanely funny and also a bit of a horror flick. The girls across the row from us kept freaking out between laughs so I guess that was the intended effect. Bill Paxton was great and was a damn believable island hippie. Think Sammy Hagar right now and his fun in Cabo San Lucas. Steve Lemme seems to have a place in the Broken Lizard movies and he was awesome this time. Kevin Heffernan is the centerpoint of this film and he held the role really well. Of course Paul Erik and Jay had did a good job too.Anyway it's probably worth your cash. If you're a Broken Lizard fan go see the movie. If you want to laugh but with a little horror go see it.  And keep an eye on these guys  they're gonna be big.".

Basically it pivots around a bunch of people stuck on an island with a killer giving it quite the oh please not another movie like that feeling. However they are not just a handful of people on a deserted island they are the staff of Pleasure Island and need to keep their cool while taking care of a load of tourists. The plot is by no means complicated but it stands out just enough and can be quite unpredictable sometimes. Just beware of a very common mistake! Don't give up after the first few minutes it gets better and better all the way to the end!This movie needs you to fulfill three different criteria before you can truly enjoy its interesting properties to the fullest. I have listed them below the first being the most important and so on. Number 1 you need to be able to laugh freely and comfortably at silly odd and stupid things. Number 2 you need to make sure you are not disturbed by almost well done gore or attractive women not wearing a whole lot of clothes. Number 3 you need to be observant enough to notice details and too tired or possibly drunk to be upset when these details don't match instead you need the ability to laugh at it.With these things in mind my punchline is This movie is a total piece of crap! Characters script effects dialog actors and most other stuff too can't be called anything other than crap! However follow the simple guidelines and force a few friends to watch it with you and you will laugh so hard you will never forget this movie. Hard to tell if the movie was intended to be hilarious or serious but regardless the intentions behind it... this is a comedy overdose! Total piece of crap but in a Very entertaining way I give it a 7 out of 10 because months later I still start laughing like a maniac when I think about some of the scenes in the movie.".

Club Dread is one of the absolute worst.It's supposed to be comedy or that's what I thought at least when I rented it but there wasn't a single funny thing in the entire movie.  Nothing funny nothing remotely entertaining or interesting.  When they chose to use the word Dread in the title maybe that was an inside joke that they thought was funny because they knew that it was absolutely dreadful.The dialogue is incomprehensible for the most part which is due to most of the actors mumbling most of the time.  Even when the written dialogue is as bad as it is in this movie you still want to be able to understand the words and it is irritating when you find yourself watching a movie and realizing that you have given up even trying to understand what the actors are saying.Okay to tell the truth one reason that I rented this movie is because of Jordan Ladd.  There is one special scene with Jordan that was particularly odd because she has an absolutely beautiful face yet due to the incredibly bad lighting in that scene her beautiful facial features were effectively obscured.  Manifestly the director and photographers had no appreciation at all for her beauty and it is a shame that such a rare opportunity was given to such clueless idiots.This movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Please don't rent this movie because if you do that will only give these people more money that they can use to make another movie and that would be criminal.".

This movie was undoubtedly the WORST comedy ever. This movie definitely doesnt deserve to be seen as a good movie. How the hell did this movie get so many 10s.This movie was advertised to me as a comedy. There was very little humor and even then the jokes were very stale. Instead this movie tried to be a horror flik. Now personally I hate horror movies but if I can find a movie that can scare me I will watch it. This movie didnt scare me and didnt make me laugh.

Kalandorok can also be defined in an alternative manner as a sensible road movie with comic undertones.It features some particularly nice musical tracks such as About A Girl Kurt Cobain and a Hungarian version of the famous French song Le Vent Nous Portera by Noir Dsir.Kalandorok is a comic film different from traditional psychological films for which Hungary has always been famous.This must be kept in mind if somebody decides to rent or watch this film.".

Further it seems like everything the characters accomplished the first time around was repealed in this story. Their desire to join the aliens in the first place was predicated on a variety of factors but each of those reasons is dissected and trashed this time out. Suddenly there is conflict and suffering during a brief oneweek visit. Characters get sick everyone argues nobody seems happy. As if that isn't bad enough a tragic suicide attempt is played almost like a joke. Since when is suicide funny? Steve Guttenberg's character was integral to the first movie but now he's just written as a clownish buffoon. The grandson's teen angst is annoying.There are a few notable moments however. One scene between Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn is deeply touching. The plight of a captured alien being studied is properly sympathetic. But scenes like these are intermingled with a menagerie of subplots which dart around between serious and comedic.This sequel wanders too far afield from the spirit of its predecessor. The result is gloomy and disappointing. See the original instead.".

Ben Wilford Brimley had explicitly told his grandson that he would never see him again it serves to cheapen that scene and many other scenes of finality in the original that they 'return' for this sequel.Another annoyance is that the hospitals and doctors that the oldsters frequent don't seem to wonder how the hell these guys have risen seemingly from the dead.That said it's wonderful to see the senior actors return again and some very real issues are covered which make this more than a worthwhile sequel all things considered. The scene of sacrifice with Joe Hume Cronyn and Alma Jessica Tandy is a whirlpool of emotion and I defy anyone not to be moved by this pair of stunning performances  it really does tug on the heartstrings as much as anything in the first movie does. It's also superb watching Bernie Jack Gilford move on with his life by dating the feisty Ruby Elaine Stritch who is more than a match for the cantankerous curmudgeon. Some brilliantly moving moments as Bernie believes he is betraying his late wife by kissing another woman...And that's what the Cocoon movies do they move you they move senior citizens  disregarded by society  to the forefront of importance and rightfully so too before we were around  they were. They deserve these films to showcase the hardships they have to go through in later life where a great deal of them to crave immortality...these films take a look what if?...and then...is it what it was cracked to be.Wonderful films wonderful actors  I'll defend these movies to the end.".

To give you an idea of how wrongheaded this followup is the opening ten minutes features a scene where an old man tries to commit suicide and it is played for laughs. So the old folks and the Anterians are back on earth. While the aliens try to save the cocoons with returning Steve Guttenberg the old folks run around for a few days and find out they are old again on earth but not before schooling some young punks on the basketball court. Everyone one from the original is back lead alien Brian Dennehy only for a cameo though with Courtney Cox the only major new addition as a young scientist who is studying one of the captured cocoons. The biggest problem with the film is it really has no reason to exist. Well outside of making money of course. It is shot so blandly that it looks almost like a TV movie and the human drama a major strength of the first film is so unsubtle this time around. The film even ends with highlights from the first film over the end credits as if to say Hey you remember the good time you had back then. Let's try and transfer some of that feeling over to this one. Yuck. Stick with the original film.".

Well don't look for this film to answer any of the philosophical questions it purports to ask. This absurdity of a movie is a series of 60second vignettes that all lead nowhere. If the original Cocoon was like two different movies Team Ameche  Team Dennehy this sequel comes across like 10 disjointed extremely poorly written high school plays. In one scene alien life is discovered in a St. Petersburg Fla. laboratory. One might think such a development would rank among the biggest stories in world history. In this film it isn't even the biggest story in the lab! That's where we see Courteney Cox donning a white doctors coat communicating with the alien.

	schema:headline " An underrated film that truly deserves to be watched and enjoyed.";
	schema:reviewBody "As other reviewers have noted sequels rarely live up to the original. Such is the case with Cocoon the Return but the film has so good in so many ways that the it truly deserves to be watched and enjoyed.I think the first film was so spectacular because of the character portrayed by Wilford Brimley. Early on in the film the character discusses taking risks with another character. He says something to the effect I have not taken a risk in years. It's not the risks you take in life that you regret. It's the risks you don't take Later on in the film the same character is discussing the possibility of going into outer space with his wife to escape the end of their lives. During the discussion he says Well I'll tell ya with the way nature's been cheating us I don't mind cheating her a little. I think these two quotes capture the way the first film focuses what's important to people in life and the universal human desire to beat death.The second film deals with the issues of what is worth dying for and what is worth living for. The answer for both is love and I think the film deals with these issues in tender and thoughtful ways. One way is the issue of selfsacrifice Whether or not we will sacrifice our lives so the ones we love can live on. Another way involves choosing to accept the limits of mortality in return for spending some time with the one you love most rather than to live forever without them. Another way involves making hard choices for the love of your children.I think the film does an excellent job with the grandfathergrandson relationship. I think it is harder for teenagers to interact with their grandparents than when they are little kids. I think teens don't always know what to say even though the love for their grandparents never diminishes. I think it is equally hard to grandparents to ever fully articulate how much their grandchildren mean to them. This film really captures this issue and there is a scene centered around a baseball game that really captures a magic moment. If I ever have a grandchild who plays any kind of sport I am going to attend every game I possibly can and break all other commitments to be there for him or her.I think the film only fails to live up to the first movie in two ways. The first is that the film fails to provide new discoveries for the viewers. Except for one modest supporting role there are no new characters introduced into the story. The other way in which the film falls short is that the final adventure at the end is not suspenseful. Only the final choices made by the main characters give the viewer any sense of surprise. I think the best sequels are written so that they can be watched and fully engaged by viewers who did not see the original. Aliens Superman II the Empire Stikes Back and Terminator II are a few good examples. The creators of Cocoon the Return forgot this golden rule and the film fell short of its full potential.Finally at least one critic complained that viewers never learn about what the elderly characters experienced in outer space. The critic has a valid point but I think the film wisely focused on the issue that no matter what supernatural experiences the elderly characters shared for five years they remained human beings who could never deny the mortality of their children or themselves.".

Not even a hint not even a dash of seasoning for the stew. Talk about a colossal missed opportunity! The film goes through the alltoopredictable followup dance steps creates new and irrelevant problems for itself muddies itself incessantly with meaningless and irritating subplots rehashes most of the previous decisions made by characters in the first film and all but dares the actors to perform this poor mess of a script. Ron Howard dodged a bullet in wisely giving this one a wide berth. Seeing the cast together again was a definite treat and the sole reason for enduring this film.

The rating would have been a few points higher for the privilege of simply being allowed to spend time with this marvelous reunited for the most part cast  but even so Steve Guttenberg once again provides a considerable penalty for viewers poisoning the film with his usual veneerthin acting abilities and his reverseMidastouch presence.

	schema:reviewBody "I was fascinated by the original Cocoon movie which had a real novel theme and succeeded in making most of us think of the value of old age the struggles aspirations and what would happen if only they could. It was touchy endearing and with real after thoughts generated out of the theme of aging.But the return is nothing novel and nothing like the first. It is embarrassing at times. Jack is back with Kitty! Oh ma! We may have excused the innocence of the initial encounter but what is happening in this movie was from clumsy to simply unsophisticated. The pregnancy topic is a mediocre addition there is an under developed story between the Grandpa and the grandson and overall nothing really new happening we have not seen in or extrapolated from the first movie. The original cast of oldies stays more or less within character and if it was not for hem and actors like Jessica Tandy Driving Miss Daisy Fried Green Tomatoes ...

It was touchy endearing and with real after thoughts generated out of the theme of aging.But the return is nothing novel and nothing like the first. It is embarrassing at times. Jack is back with Kitty! Oh ma! We may have excused the innocence of the initial encounter but what is happening in this movie was from clumsy to simply unsophisticated. The pregnancy topic is a mediocre addition there is an under developed story between the Grandpa and the grandson and overall nothing really new happening we have not seen in or extrapolated from the first movie. The original cast of oldies stays more or less within character and if it was not for hem and actors like Jessica Tandy Driving Miss Daisy Fried Green Tomatoes ... I would have given an even worst grading.In short the magic was gone and it would have been best not to make a sequel.";

So the old gang is back to once again help their alien friends get those cocoons. What have they done in the time they have been gone you ask? Well do not ask you get nothing about the aliens and their way of life. You do get to see that a one week trip back to earth makes them very cranky very quickly. You also get to find out on of them is pregnant how wonderfully creepy. I mean seeing them act young and stuff in the first one was good and all but this is a step or two to far. Then you have your very awkward scene of the girl that liked Steve Guttenberg in the first one not able to control herself in a crowded restaurant. So the highly advance race of aliens can not even control themselves in public? I mean she is not only acting very badly she is exposing herself as an alien to a crowded room. Just a sequel that should not have been I hate the ending with some of the elders staying to be with their daughter and grandson then I guess they get to die and considering these aliens that live forever most likely no god in this universe so they get to be worm food but hey the grandson will have gotten to know his grandparents and attended their funeral. Such fun to be had here.".

Don't love it and it wasn't without occasional flaws but it was warm funny and touching that looked great with a lovely James Horner score with a delightful older cast. Decided to see 'Cocoon The Return' despite being prepared to be disappointed on the basis of what had been said about it. Actually didn't find 'Cocoon The Return' to be that bad all things considered was definitely expecting something far worse. It is nowhere near as good as the first and one does question its point despite being nowhere near close to being one of the worst sequels ever it is one of the ones that was not needed. Having said that 'Cocoon The Return' is not without its moments and good points amidst all the major problems it has.Its selling point is that the original cast return and it is the acting or at least most of it that saves it. Most are quite wonderful the sass and distinguished air as well as the likeability are still present with the best coming from touching turns from Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn and Don Ameche still has the spring in his step. The film looks good enough with some skilful photography in particular that has style and polish and the effects aren't overused abused or stick out like a sore thumb. James Horner's score is lush and not too sweeping or syrupy. There are some genuinely sweet and poignant moments those involving Joe and Alma did make me well up. Although underused and not consistent with the first film the scifi element intrigues somewhat.However the direction is nowhere near as focused or polished here at best it's uninspired. Ron Howard's absence is noted and deeply felt. The story does have moments but there was a much better balance of humour and drama before. Whereas 'Cocoon' managed to be emotionally impactful while not wallowing too much in the sentimentality 'Cocoon The Return' is caked in it and it does become mawkish and just lacks the necessary warmth and whimsy. Not enough is done with some of the too many subplots the grandsongrandfather relationship should have been delved into more and was actually lacking in warmth. Others didn't serve much point and parts did veer on distaste the whole suicide thing as mentioned being treated in a comedic way does a real disservice to something so serious. The script has moments of warmth but too much of it is rather glum and resigned and too reliant on melodrama. Tahnee Welch is somewhat robotic and Steve Guttenberg is just irritating and his character could easily have been left out.Concluding worth a one time watch but a disappointment both as a sequel and on its own. 510 Bethany Cox".

A major problem though is the 3rd story within about David now much older and Grandfather Ben which could be good but they ruin it by not going farther in and just halfheartedly putting it in there. Another large problem is the fact that Ron Howard was not able to direct this film and it shows! Also Welch's performance in this sequel has her character change to that of something you wouldn't recognize to the Kitty in the first film...which totally throws off some of the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "There is not much justice in the world and film history writing is no exception. This seldom shown classic of 50's German cinema is hardly ever mentioned although at least in my opinion  it should be considered a minor masterpiece. It is superbly directed by Rudolf Jugert a Kutneradept but  one can only fantasize about what would have happened when Helmut Kutner himself would have directed it.The basis for this film is a brilliant refined and intelligent script by Fritz Rotter and Helmut Kutner but there must have been a big influence of producer Erich Pommer too. The script is full of visual ideas that symbolize the story and with psychologically welldeveloped characters. At facevalue it tells the story of a truckdriver but this is not more than an instrument for a more universal theme the detour the truck driver is forced to take and at which point he meets for the first time Inge is a detour in life that could happen to anyone. The truck is not only a truck but stands for the straight and honest life the truck driver has had the moment he takes Inge aboard he indeed makes a detour from this life. The script has a number of these story telling delights and to mention them  would be giving away the plot and that shows how tight this script is.  To see them all requires second and third viewing. The brilliance about all this is that at the end there are no loose ends when the detour is raised there is only an open road for the truck driver and his wife.The thing I very much liked was that something of the detour will always influence the rest of the truck driver's life so that in the end the detour was not totally in vain  the script is never sentimental and always honest.There other aspects to this film that are simply splendid cast cinematography and last but not least the music of Werner Eisbrenner. Note Eisbrenner's music in the scene where Inge tries on the new clothes Heinrich has given her.Not all the members of the cast can be mentioned but I have to mention the following three Hans Albers in one of his best parts of his film career Hildegarde Knef sensitive and convincing portrayal of Inge and surely Marius Goring  in one of his rare German films  astonishing as Kurt giving him the cold and cynical as well as the human and frail side of his character.".

The script has a number of these story telling delights and to mention them  would be giving away the plot and that shows how tight this script is.  To see them all requires second and third viewing. The brilliance about all this is that at the end there are no loose ends when the detour is raised there is only an open road for the truck driver and his wife.The thing I very much liked was that something of the detour will always influence the rest of the truck driver's life so that in the end the detour was not totally in vain  the script is never sentimental and always honest.There other aspects to this film that are simply splendid cast cinematography and last but not least the music of Werner Eisbrenner. Note Eisbrenner's music in the scene where Inge tries on the new clothes Heinrich has given her.Not all the members of the cast can be mentioned but I have to mention the following three Hans Albers in one of his best parts of his film career Hildegarde Knef sensitive and convincing portrayal of Inge and surely Marius Goring  in one of his rare German films  astonishing as Kurt giving him the cold and cynical as well as the human and frail side of his character.";

	schema:headline " excellent forgotten film from post war Germany";
	schema:reviewBody "This interesting West German film was made when the country was in the first phase of reconstruction but still under the occupation of the Allied powers. The vignettes of German life at the time include such historically valuable details as the presence of the US military police as well as ample signs of reconstruction of the autobahns requiring frequent detours which play an important part in this dramathriller. The main character is an elderly married truck driver Hans Albers with a newlywed daughter. During his tours from Bavaria to Frankfurt he has a fateful encounter with a hitchhiking young woman Hildegard Knef who is already engaged in a liaison with a black marketeer Marius Goring. Albers was a great German actor with a big film repertoire who was often cast in aristocratic roles cf. Mnchhausen 1943. It is all the more remarkable therefore that he was able to play this truck driver so convincingly. Hildegard Knef too gives a brilliant performance first ensnarling the old man according to the scheme plotted by her lover but in the end becoming seriously involved with Albers. She makes this transition very convincingly demonstrating what an accomplished actress she was. Marius Goring was an English actor who also made some films on the Continent. Usually typecast as a villain in British films he plays the same type of role here in his usual assured manner. It is interesting to compare Albers in this role with his slightly younger French contemporary Jean Gabin who also plays a family man and truck driver in Verneuil's film Des gens sans importance 1956 which features similarly a fateful encounter with a young woman. Nachts auf den Straen is a wellcrafted film with an interesting story excellent performances by some of the best German actors of the time and beautiful photography which captures the fascinating background of a Germany in transformation but still scarred from the war. This is a forgotten film which I think deserves to be known by a broader international public hence the English hard subs available on youtube so far".

	schema:reviewBody "THE STREET WHERE CRIME FLOURISHES IS THE STREET THAT EXTENDS RIGHT ACROSS America. IT IS THE STREET WITH NO NAME............J.Edgar Hoover.From the vaults of 20th. Century Fox comes this excellent crime thriller THE STREET WITH NO NAME. Produced for the studio in 1948 by Samuel G.Engel it was directed with great care to detail and atmosphere by William Keighley. Crisply photographed by master cinematographer Joe MacDonald it was beautifully written for the screen by Harry Kleiner and was filmed by Fox in their customary forties semidocumentary style that they had started producing with great success in 1945 with The House On 92nd Street.Richard Widmark is Alec Stiles. The vicious over dressed leader of a gang of hoodlums who are terrorizing the city with their well planned robberies and killings. Determined to outwit and bring them down the FBI under Inspector Briggs Lloyd Nolan trains an undercover agent Gene Cordell Mark Stevens to infiltrate the gang to find out just how and from who they are getting their information prior to every job they undertake. After gaining Stiles' confidence and becoming a trusted gang member Cordell's life is put in grave danger when the mysterious informer he seeks exposes him to Stiles. The picture ends with an exciting and action filled finale in a well staged shootout between the gang and FBI agents.The acting is good throughout. Mark Stevens heads a nicely chosen cast as the undercover agent. Stevens an actor who had some degree of success was a mildly appealing leading man in the forties and fifties. After many bit parts billed under his real name of Stephen Richards Objective BurmaPride Of The Marines he changed his name and with the exception of Cry Vengeance 1954 and Timetable 1956  which he also directed  appeared in his fair share of indifferent movies. THE STREET WITH NO NAME was one of his better and more memorable efforts. Mark Stevens died in 1977. Also good to watch is Lloyd Nolan. Here repeating his role as the FBI's Inspector Briggs from House On 92nd Street and there's a nice contribution too from John McIntire as Steven's fellow undercover agent. But there is no doubt the picture belongs to Richard Widmark. This was the actor's second movie after his blistering nominated debut performance the previous year in Kiss Of Death Here as Stiles he is just as mean but without the Tommy Udo snigger. Two years later Widmark would give what is arguably his greatest performance when he played the racist young thug in No Way Out 1950.As was usual with Fox during this period for this type of picture there is no music score except for a robust march theme heard over the opening and closing credits. Nevertheless THE STREET WITH NO NAME remains a memorable noir and a classic crime thriller.In 1955 Fox remade the picture as House Of Bamboo. This was a most unfortunate decision. Its noir antecedents were utterly lost in the totally unsuitable Cinemascopecolour presentation. Moreover its daft and questionable decision to relocate the entire story to a Tokyo setting makes one wonder what sort of brainstorm Fox's head of production was going through at the time and did he even see the original. Hmmm!".

Most directors assigned these tasks in the noir cycle wrote off such idolatry as a cost of doing business clearing it away quickly so as to get on with their moviemaking William Keighley follows this sensible agenda.FBI agent Mark Stevens goes undercover to infiltrate the mob in that cesspool of crime Center City USA.  In the boxing ring he attracts the attention slightly open to inference of boss Richard Widmark a dapper I like my boys to look sharp cutthroat with a morbid fear of drafts and sneezes.  With the aid of confederate John McIntyre Stevens reports the gang's plans back to the FBI.  Alas a highplaced informant in the police department reports the FBI's plans back to Widmark.So the movie boils down to the agentinperil story.  Keighley tells it cleanly and briskly eschewing the complexities both visual and moral of Anthony Mann's TMen released just a few months earlier.  It's strongest in the feel for Center City's raffish tenderloin with its fleabag hotels pool halls and walkup gyms.  Stevens McIntyre and Lloyd Nolan as Stevens' superior give workmanlike jobs with the rather staid roles scriptwriter Harry Kleiner supplies.  His fewfrills approach reins in Widmark too who's always better when he's unfettered and shooting over the top. The Street With No Name suffers a bit from staying so resolutely allguy thus Barbara Lawrence suffers too in an underwritten and inconsequential part as Widmark's abused moll.  A little more cool yin might have balanced out all that hot hard yang.NOTE In 1955 Samuel Fuller remade  and rethought  this movie using the same screenwriter and cinematographer Joe MacDonald now working in color as House of Bamboo set in postwar Tokyo.".

They send a mole MARK STEVENS to infiltrate the mob and get the goods on Widmarknot unlike the situation in Cagney's WHITE HEAT.While this one doesn't approach the finesse of Raoul Walsh's WHITE HEAT it's a solidly entertaining piece of crime melodrama given punch by some good overall performances. Aside from Widmark and Stevens the cast includes reliable Fox contract players BARBARA LAWRENCE ED BEGLEY DONALD BUKA and JOHN McINTIRE.Based on an actual FBI case there's some narration in the manner of other Fox films in this genre. Upcoming MARK STEVENS has the most interesting role and does well with it. Stevens is a young actor who never got his full due at Fox although he appeared in a number of strong films.Summing up Well worth seeing if you're a fan of film noir.".

	schema:headline " Catch Stiles Gang. Signed Hoover.";
	schema:reviewBody "This story of an FBI undercover agent Mark Stevens who infiltrates the gang headed by Alec Stiles Richard Widmark is introduced by a lengthy warning about how unless the new gangsterism is stopped three out of four of us will become its victims. This teletype message is signed simply Hoover meaning J. Edgar Hoover PresidentforLife of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Everybody knew who he was at the time. He was an anticrime icon. This immediately raises the question Instead of signing it Hoover why not just H? After all a simple N was good enough for Napoleon. A second question not nearly so interesting is how the hell Hoover knew that 75 percent of us would become victims of the new gangsterism? A third question of no importance whatever is what IS the new gangsterism? The film seems to tell us that it has something to do with organized criminals using modern methods of technology but history hasn't demonstrated the case.Anyway this is a pretty good combination of the kinds of docudramas popular in the later 1940s usually directed by Henry Hathaway and narrated by the stentorian Reed Hadley and the equally popular noir films of the time all wet streets at night and corrupt cops and blond molls and the secret government undercover agent always nudging up against the possibility of being outed somehow. Still relevant when you come right down to it.Loyd Nolan carries over his character of Inspector Briggs from The House on 92nd Street. Ed Begley provides a red herring. Barbara Lawrence is 19 years old slender and beautiful as Widmark's wife. Widmark is sort of like his Tommy Udo character from Kiss of Death but more organized less psychopathic and without the wolf man hairpiece. John MacIntire is Steven's FBI contact in the seedy slums of Center City. Mark Stevens is actually not too bad. His technique is a little stiff in the boxing ring but it's Stevens not a double who's doing the dancing around. Stevens also does his own flying leap onto the deck of a departing ferry. This is unusual if for no other reason than that had he twisted an ankle or broken a leg it would have cost this midbudget production a fortune. One thing that can be said about these kinds of films they had great character actors and they were good at what they did.The crew were good as well. The photography here by Joe McDonald is outstanding full of distorted shadows and phantom menace and it's matched by the set dressing. Check out the basement of the gym and the room where the armament is stashed. It looks positively USED except maybe for the superfluity of cobwebs that reminds one of a Halloween display in a supermarket.Most of the plot is as suspenseful as the ending is unbelievable. The thugs prop up the unconscious Stevens so that he can be riddled by the police who believe they are interrupting a burglary. But Stevens' body slides off the safe door and slumps to the floor. That's a pretty stupid way to prop up an unconscious man. Then too why should the cops riddle the first thug they catch sight of at a breakin? Without a word of warning? And why later do they do the same thing to Widmark's character? No wonder they called it Center City instead of Los Angeles or San Pedro. But whatever it's called the location shooting is just fine. The chief city street  Main Street in downtown L.A.  is really shabby. Stores sell old clothing and leather jackets. There are gymnasiums and penny arcades and hamburger joints and flop houses. Stevens rents a room in one of these joints and when he enters it for the first time and sees how dilapidated it is he smiles  because it's perfect cover for him. I vaguely remember some of the dialog from the first time I saw this. Corrupt cop on phone to Widmark outing Stevens Do you know a fighter named George Manly? Widmark Yeah. Cop You shouldn't. I remembered too the wordless deliberate pursuit of Stevens by Widmark through the darkened gym after Stevens has fired Widmark's Luger to get the slug. It's long and it's utterly silent except for a heavy bag in the gym swinging a little and creaking slightly. Nice job.".

	schema:reviewBody "At first the docudrama approach feels like kind of a safety net that prevents the viewer from losing himself completely in this striking noir universe but the intricacies of the police work were interesting to watch unfold and this is still a strong film.  Particularly memorable are the taut virtually noiseless chase scenes that take place in suitably dark nightmarish settings like the one where crook Widmark sniffs out undercover cop Stevens at the hideout. I also liked the colorful low life lingo such as when one of the thugs tells Stevens to pick yourself a boomboom as they suit up for their big score.Great to see Richard Widmark doing what he does best  playing villains of course. Few actors could match Widmark when it came to that staple of screen heavies losing their temper. This guy slaps people's faces with a karatelike precision that's remarkable. And just the way he tells some flunkie henchman he doesn't want around to blow is pure heaven. In a role like this he owns the screen he's like a well dressed rat always scavenging for his next meal.I was reading a Cornell Woolrich story about a year ago and one of the characters used a Mark Stevens' picture as an alibi for where they had been at a certain time. Never having heard of Stevens I assumed it was just a made up movie star name and movie title I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now. Imagine my surprise when shortly thereafter I looked up his name and found out that there certainly was such an actor a borderline leading man who apparently enjoyed some level of stardom during a 30 or so film career. Judging by his appearance here he's a good functional actor though he has the sort of face it's easy to forget. Which is probably why he was selected for this part as he isn't asked to carry the film he's off screen for about half the running time and as an undercover agent he's naturally required to blend in with his new environment. He does that quite well.".

	schema:reviewBody "I viewed The Street With No Name for the first time in a long time last night and it was as exciting as the first time I watched itWhat a great movie! Based on real FBI files and shot on location where possible Awesome!!! It's an early Donnie Brosco with a very dark wonderful twist. The movie is a statement on corruption and just how hot it can get for the personpeople trying to bring down a very powerful influential criminal gang of thugs. While the movie does play on the good guys not being so good element of film noir the genre as a whole is just as much about how the movie is shot as it is about characters and how this movie was shot is where this film falls short of being film noir. While the movie is a very dark crime movie and a lot of the scenes are filmed outdoors on rainy nights the movie merely gives a nod to the lightingshadowing aspects of film noir as there are quite a few day scenes andor scenes that are shot in very well lit rooms i.e. the boxing gym the FBI offices etc.. Furthermore getting back to characters this movie is missing one key element if it is to be considered film noir...Aside from the lighting how women are portrayed in this film also causes it to fall far short of film noir I won't give up the details but watch the movie and you'll see what I mean if you know about the roll a woman should play in a noir film. Finally Although I liked his part in The Kiss Of Death a little moreboy was he evil in that movie Richard Widmark does a great job in this one of his earlier films and the rest of the actors do a very competent job in playing their parts as well. An 88.5 in my book A great movie but i don't know if it should be considered film noir.".

Widmark's performance is really the only noteworthy one in the film. His presence while not overwhelming is still bodacious. He's neither chilling nor very menacing even though he's mean as hell to his nonfemme fatale girlfriend yet there's something charismatic about him that makes you want to watch his unique screen presence here.The last 45 minutes of the film is truly excellent entertainment and the final 10 minutes or so is a wet dark dripping noir.I'd give it 10 stars if not for the first few scenes that don't involve Widmark.".

The chase scenes in this movie are well done and the use of minimalistic sound and shadows combine to make a memorable movie. The DVD has commentary by film historians and is worth renting and worth owning if you like Film Noir flicks . A".

	onyx:emotionText "The Street With No Name an excellent film noir from Fox featuring a charismatic Richard Widmark as the leader of the Stiles gang.I saw most of the elements of this movie earlier this month when I saw House of Bamboo which lifted several parts of this plot and transported them to post WWII Japan.This movie dispenses with the trite romance that threatened to throw it's remake off the rails and is a straight FBI v the bad guys movie mixing tons of location shooting with stock footagelike another Fox film House on 92nd Street that also featured Lloyd Nolan as agent Briggs this movie manages to capture a vivid and raw underworld that draws the viewer in. The chase scenes in this movie are well done and the use of minimalistic sound and shadows combine to make a memorable movie. The DVD has commentary by film historians and is worth renting and worth owning if you like Film Noir flicks . A";

	schema:reviewBody "The Street With No Name is a superior example of the docunoir style which became so popular in the late 1940s. With its story based on an actual FBI case real FBI officers taking roles in the movie and the action being shot in the locations where the events actually took place it's clear that every effort was made to make the end product as authentic and convincing as possible. The result in this case is an absorbing thriller which proceeds at a great pace whilst also managing to incorporate some extremely tense sequences.The cinematography by Joseph MacDonald is interesting because it utilises two main styles. The passages featuring the criminals are predominantly shown in shadowy film noir style whilst those depicting the FBI generally feature a more bland high key look. Employing these styles of course conforms with the traditions of film noir and documentary film making however the symbolism involved is also clear.An FBI agent Gene Cordell Mark Stevens is furnished with a false identity George Manly and a criminal record and given the task of getting into a gang which is suspected of having recently carried out three murders in Center City. Cordell uses his considerable boxing skills to impress gang boss Alex Stiles Richard Widmark who also happens to be the owner of a gym where local boxers train. Stiles who prides himself on running his organisation on scientific lines uses a corrupt contact in the Police Department to check on Manly's criminal record and is so impressed by the feedback he receives that he invites Manly to join his outfit.When the Stiles gang plan a robbery at a local mansion Cordell passes the information back to his colleagues and the FBI and the police jointly stake out the place. The operation has to be aborted however when Stiles calls off the job after receiving a tip off from his contact in the Police Department. Cordell then goes to the gang's arsenal and locates and fires Stiles' revolver so that forensic tests can be run on the bullet to check if the gun was used in any of the recent murders. Stiles soon realises that his gun has been fired and a fingerprint check that he arranges with his police contact reveals that the gang has been infiltrated by FBI agent Cordell. Stiles' struggle to execute his plan and Cordell's efforts to achieve his objectives bring the men into deadly conflict in an exciting and action packed conclusion to the story.Mark Stevens gives a solid performance as the confident and courageous Gene Cordell and Richard Widmark is absolutely compelling as a cunning crafty and neurotic criminal who's convinced of the need to employ increasingly sophisticated methods in order to remain successful. This shrewd side of his character is complemented by an unrestrained brutality which enables him to be both a merciless killer and a violent wife beater.The attention given to the different scientific methods used by both the criminals and the FBI provide an unusual and interesting additional dimension to the events depicted and suggest that in 1948 these methods were fully expected to form an important component of any future battles between the worlds of crime and law enforcement.".

	schema:reviewBody "Street with No Name The 1948  out of 4 A couple gangland killings prompt the FBI to sent agent Gene Cordell Mark Stevens into a mob being ran by the hottempered Alec Stiles Richard Widmark. The two strike up a good working relationship but soon informants tip off Stiles and Cordell must try and find a way out before getting killed. This crimethriller has a lot in common with THE HOUSE ON 92ND STREET although a lot of issues in that film are corrected here. Thankfully all the introductions and most of the narration is cut out in this film as the screenwriters obviously thought viewers would be smart enough to follow the story without having to have someone tell us what's going on every few minutes. By not having the narration we're greeting with some fine performances as both Stevens and Widmark really nail their characters. Stevens comes off very good as the undercover agent as he perfectly fits the role and comes across smart enough to be able to do everything we see here. It should come as no shock that Widmark steals the film as the snake gangster. There's a scene where he beats up his girlfriend that is so perfectly shot and acted that it really does seem like Widmark is getting a kick out of doing it. He has that certain toughness and coolness that makes his character very cold and he does all of this without a single problem. Ed Begley has a supporting role and does great work with it and we get strong performances by Lloyd Nolan Donald Buka and Barbara Lawrence. This film has been labeled a filmnoir but I really didn't see it as this has a lot more in common with the gangster films being released by Warner a decade earlier rather than any of the mysteries or dramas coming from various other studios around this time. The use of shadows will certainly remind folks of noir but that's pretty much it. As a crime film this here works extremely well because we've got a hero we can care for and a villain that we love to hate. The actual story being told certainly isn't anything too original but it's entertaining enough to work and keep the viewer captivated from start to finish. Keighley's direction is topnotch throughout and he has no problem building up a nice atmosphere that hangs thickly over the film. Fans of Scorsese will also notice a few touches in both GOODFELLAS and THE DEPARTED.".

Because of the success of the film Lloyd Nolan returns as the same FBI investigator but this time he's out to smash organized crime. And once again the film capitalizes on what made the first one so goodrealism. While there certainly are some film noirlike touches especially the lighting but also the dialog and type of plot the movie emphasizes realism over stylemuch like some of the best of the genre such as Naked City.The film begins with a series of brutal robberies in which some of the victims are killed. As a result Nolan becomes involved. However he needs a man on the inside to investigate the mob so he finds a very proficient young Gman to infiltrate. Mark Stevens is this agent and goes to Skid Row to be seen by the local riffraffhoping to find some mob contacts. I loved how the film used words like Skid Row and set one of the crimes in the genericsounding Center Citya cute use of film noir style names and in effort to make a film that could be placed in any big city in America.Eventually Stevens is able to impress the local mob bitshot played by Richard Widmark when he boxes in a mobcontrolled joint. The local favorite though a strong guy is an undisciplined boxer and Stevens acquits himself very well in the ring against him. Widmark is impressed and approaches Stevens to feel him outwill this guy be able to make the grade in the mob? Watch it yourself and see! Overall excellent on all levels. A mustsee for lovers of noir and good crime dramas.".

Apparently utilising real cops FBI and internal and external locations this is a most involving and believable little thriller. The opening is a bit dated with it's 'raise the flag' and breast beating stance in the name of J Edgar Hoover but once this gets going it is really intoxicating. The night streets of 'skid row' are dripping with shadows as one character after another slips in and out of doorways to pool house or strip joints. There is a major sequence in a boxing gym with a couple of fights in progress and training going on around whilst a bunch of hoods take and place bets on this and that. Good tale very well told and beautifully photographed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was very pleasantly entertained by this betterthanstandard Bmovie fare.I'd heard about this film for many years promising myself to see it at some time  mainly because I knew Richard Widmark was one of the stars. But when a DVD came across to me recently I received it with mixed feelings I found out that Mark Stevens had top billing with Widmark and Llyod Nolan another good actor from the 30s and 40s I liked in support. Y'see I'd seen Stevens in a few of his later movies and hadn't been much impressed. However...The story is filmed and told in the style of a number of FBIcentered films of that era that is as a docudrama in effect. It's a guy film gals are almost nonexistent the exception being Judy Stiles Barbara Lawrence the abused wife of the very murderous gangster Alec Stiles Widmark whom Gene Cordell FBI agent Stevens is commissioned to bring down by infiltrating Stiles' gang to secure the necessary evidence.So the story is  in a real sense  by the numbers in this case no pun intended the very detailed processes used within the FBI to get the bad guys. Using voiceover narration we learn all about FBI lab procedures it wasn't called 'forensics' in those times for tracking guns and bullets agent training procedures administrative procedures for tracking criminals and operations procedures for communicating with undercover operatives. Frankly any real crime at that time could have learned a lot by watching this film...maybe.In a nutshell Cordell gets his man Stiles in an excellently staged shootout at night in a large factory on the outskirts of Center City the fictional city for the story  but as J Edgar Hoover intones at the start it could be any city any street across USA. Prior to that however Cordell  using the cover name of George Manly what a moniker  what a man!  worms his way into the gang by demonstrating his macho coolness in the boxing ring and his naked ambition to do anything for a buck. That cockiness impresses Stiles. So our man is in... From there the final shootout is just a matter of time.If it were only that this would not have been a remarkable story or film. But it is more than that because it's also a mystery a subplot the likes of which I'd never before seen in gangster movies of the forties but which over fifty years later resurfaces in none other than Scorsese's The Departed 2006. To some extent also a similar narrative was used in House of Bamboo 1955 with Robert Ryan and Robert Stack as another Stiles and Manly combo so to speak.However it's the bad cop gangster inside the cops versus the good cop inside the gangsters that's so riveting and so similar between this film and The Departed  even to the extent of no cops knowing about the rottencop mole within nor the gangsters knowing about the goodcop mole within them. And neither mole knows who the other is also... Ah delicious! As in Scorsese's great effort the setup in this film is almost as well done too. Hence the tension and dramatic irony build inexorably as Stiles sets out to whack Manly when his identity is revealed just as the cops discover the identity of the bad apple within. It's a delicious filmic sequence as the director William Keighly cuts between both camps shot for shot showing how each of the moles is faring as the duplicate nets close in around each.Add to that the very realistic filming on location in Washington Los Angeles San Pedro and Santa Ana  the rainslicked streets the boxing gym the clip joints the seedy hotels the dirty diners  and you have a much better than average Bmovie that gets it right all the way through. Moreover take note of the camera work and lighting the crisp editing and sharp dialog all superior stuff. So if you've seen The Departed then you already have an appreciation about how good this movie is.And I for one was thoroughly delighted to watch Mark Stevens who fit his role nigh on perfectly. And  surprise!  he showed that he could indeed box during a wellchoreographed sequence when he made a fool of a heavyweight at Stiles' gym. Not to be outdone perhaps Widmark gave another good performance and also surprised me by playing the piano unless it was dubbed of course  a gangster with an appreciation of art no less. Well why not? Stiles was a fashionable and erudite guy in his own way. Smart too...Lloyd Nolan naturally again provided a polished but steely performance as Agent Briggs and ably abetted by that great old character actor Ed Begley unforgettable in 12 Angry Men 1957 as Police Chief Harmatz. Round out the cast with John McIntire as Agent Cy Gordon plus a number of other lesserknown actors for a real treat in the gangstercrime genre.Thoroughly recommended for all to see.".

The only tedious aspect is the patriotic music on the sound track whenever the documentary underpinning of the story invokes the presence of the FBI but that was the 1940s for you. Otherwise everything hits the jackpot. The film is dominated by Richard Widmark who had a tendency to steal every film he was in. He plays another of one of his brilliant psycho cases as in Negulesco's 'Road House' with Ida Lupino the same year. Mark Stevens makes a stolid and squarejawed FBI hero Barbara Lawrence has few scenes but handles them brilliantly getting the tone of her part perfect a mixture of languid drollery and hysterical fear. Lloyd Nolan is the determined warrior of righteousness which suited him. Widmark has some intriguing little psychological tricks onscreen in this part possibly added at his own initiative. He portrays himself as a real hypochondriac with sinus problems. Once he casually complains that a room is too cold on one occasion he is squeezing his upper nose and another time he is neurotically sniffing menthol. This is all so subtle you could easily miss it but it gives depth to the character so that he is not just a onedimensional crazed criminal and killer. However Widmark never needed to worry about being onedimensional as the trouble was always finding room to squeeze the other actors onto the screen when he was around. He had a way of hypnotising directors and cameramen they just couldn't keep their lenses off him.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Street with No Name 1948Lloyd Nolan appears as George Briggs FBI agent exactly as he did in Henry Hathaway's 1945 House on 92nd Street and again we see the FBI steadfastly solve a crime. This time it isn't that largest of themes the atom bomb but a more routine and gripping one robbery and murder. Short parts of the film are basic FBI training dramatizations well done but a little undramatic and there is sometimes the inevitable omniscient narrator a little heavyhanded but the rest of the film cooks along really well. Watch for some great noir scenes including an edgy shootout in a factory.Most interesting is the presence of Richard Widmark in his second film after after Hathaway's Kiss of Death. He is an interesting addition to any movie from snarling bad guy in Kiss to navy officer in The Bedford Incident. The plot moves at a good clip and the mayhem compounds as the FBI gradually builds leads and uses its huge resources and then the straight drama gets going and the movie takes off. There are some great night shots and once the lead agents get out on their own in the layered jazz of the city it gets edgy and pretty exciting. It never becomes something completely selfsustaining and special however due to the need to explain the FBI's tireless and all too flawless efforts.Director William Keighley had an uneven career but some high points including the legendary Robin Hood of 1938. Street with No Name pulls together a lot of great scenes from sleazy hotel rooms to a boxing gym. I enjoyed this a lot more than the seemingly similar in budget and intent House on 92nd Street also 20th Century Fox. You'll notice that there is a lot of trading and overlap of talent in these Fox films and these are basically B movies that have the hook of actual FBI promotion built in. Efficient stuff made for a quick appearance and some short term money the directors knew these were not classics. Because we know the FBI will steadfastly succeed a certain suspense is removed. But maybe that's comparing it to classics like Fox's Kiss of Death which isn't fair. The Street with No Name is sometimes dazzling and definitely a qualified pleasure.".

	schema:reviewBody "The only Washington bureaucrat I've ever heard of who could strike fear into the hearts of gangsters suspected Commies and U.S. presidents alike was J. Edgar Hoover. Even when he was wearing a housedress while cleaning his home he must have been a fearsome presence. The Street With No Name is like The House on 92nd Street filmed three years earlier a semidocumentary hymn to the house that Hoover built reverently produced by Darryl Zanuck and complete with the equivalent of organ music a stirringly patriotic dum dedum film score and a heavenly chorus one of those stentorian voiceovers that Reed Hadley used to do so well. However unlike The House on 92nd Street which now seems dated and cringingly naive The Street With No Name contains elements that hold up fairly well...but you have to get past all that FBI worship which is difficult to do. Alec Stiles runs a smart murderous gang which has moved from numbers to gambling to heists and along the way has started to kill those who get in its way. Gene Cordell is an FBI agent who is ordered to go undercover work his way into the gang earn Stiles' confidence and then blow the whistle. Stiles is no dummy but Cordell posing as a tough drifter named George Manley pulls it off. Life gets dangerous for Cordell when an informer in the police department tips off Stiles. Stiles has to call off a major robbery at the last minute and then sets out to identify the rat. He doesn't know it's Manley but he knows it has to be someone in his gang. It all comes together in a tough murderous shootout. Sound a little like House of Bamboo? It should. House of Bamboo located in Tokyo and with Robert Stack in the Cordell role and Robert Ryan in Stiles' shoes was based on The Street With No Name. What's good about The Street With No Name? Mainly the look of the film. Most of it was shot in grubby Los Angles locations often at night with damp streets and harsh lighting. The crummy secondfloor hotels the sweaty boxing center you can pay 25cents and watch two losers pound each other for three rounds the deserted factory the nighttime ferry building...all look awful which means they look great. Alec Stiles' wife played by Barbara Lawrence is a fine noir dame full of whiny petulant sexiness. Two members of Stiles' gang also make an impression Donald Buka as Shivvy Stiles' righthand man who never seems happy and prefers a knife and Joseph Pevney as Matty always grinning who loves blondes and would turn in his own mother. Richard Widmark as Stiles gives the movie its energy. This was Widmark's second movie a year after creating a vivid Tommy Udo in Kiss of Death. There's a good deal of Udo's menace in Stiles but Widmark makes him a lot smarter. We'd be negligent if we didn't also give credit to Alec Stiles' nasal inhaler. Stiles has a thing about fresh air and germs he uses his nasal inhaler the way some children use their fingers. But then there are the notsogood things. The movie is constantly interrupted with scenes that show how steadfast and resourceful the FBI is especially with all their newfangled technical resources in Washington. Every time we stop to see these FBI resources in action ordered by Lloyd Nolan reprising his role as George Briggs from The House on 92nd Street the movie stops too. The voiceover and the grandiose FBI music have the same effect. Another major defect is Mark Stevens as Gene CordellGeorge Manley. Stevens was a good looking Blevel leading man but a limited actor without much screen presence. This is in my view the same fatal flaw in House of Bamboo when Robert Stack was cast as the goodguy tough guy. Neither actor is believable. They drain tension. Fortunately Widmark and Ryan by the power of their performances still make the two movies interesting. I can't think of too many actors who were able to parley creepiness into major leadingman stardom. Widmark with his skulllike face and easy giggle is not a guy I would have bet on to be a serious leading man for the next 25 years. It shows I suppose that even in Hollywood talent sometimes counts for a lot.".

	schema:headline " Darkly comedic psychological thriller which delights";
	schema:reviewBody "I attended the World Premiere of Nobel Son at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival. That's Nobel as in Nobel Prize and it takes the festival prize in my book. This winning film from writerdirectorproducereditor Randall Miller did he make lunch too? is on my list of Top 10 Picks from among the 30 I saw at this year's festival.Professor Eli Michaelson Alan Rickman is about to win the Nobel Prize. His son Barkley Bryan Greenberg is a promising Ph.D. candidate wanting little to do with his father's pomposity. A scheme is hatched which is sure to pit father against son in a way to maximize their inherent rivalry. Let the madness and mayhem begin. In addition to Greenberg and Rickman Nobel Son stars a troupe of talented veterans including Bill Pullman Shawn Hatosy Danny DeVito Mary Steenburgen Ted Danson Ernie Hudson and Eliza Dushku.It's always hard to single anyone out in such an amazing ensemble cast. Greenberg the titular son is a worthy protagonist. The roller coaster ride on which he is taken is chilling yet his upper crust background and bravado veneer cannot hide his childlike innocence. It is that vulnerability which sucks us in and compels us to look even when we would rather look away.Shawn Hatosy is one of the most prolific and versatile young actors in the business and he is frighteningly brilliant here. The intensity he brings to this role never lets up from start to finish. Nobody is better at psychoscary. Many will be blown away by his performance. If he wasn't on your radar before he will be after you see Nobel Son.Alan Rickman provides most of the comic relief in a film that is much more dark than comedic. A lesser actor could have turned in an overthetop performance which might have tipped the scales in favor of the lighter side of this film. That would have spoiled the intensity of the violent escapades these young men partake in. But he manages to play the buffoon as only a legend can.I was quite surprised by the look and feel of this film. It's much more stylized than one might expect. Digital effects and clever camera work help take what could have been a standard caper movie a la Oceans 11 and turn it into a psychological thriller emphasis on the thrills. It is such a fascinating story and an amazing script and kudos to Randall Miller for being able to create a work which defies categorization. Gasps and laughs are traded back and forth yet it manages to toe the line between comedy and tragedy without losing its focus.If Kubrick inhaled nitrous oxide while making A Clockwork Orange it might look something like Nobel Son. It will keep you on the edge of your seat literally. Nobel Son is a breathtaking refreshing escape from convention.".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. Bottle Shock director Randall Miller is back ... only Nobel Son was filmed first you really have to love the Hollywood system. While Bottle Shock was a pretty straight forward retelling of a wine industry break through this film takes us on a dark ride with blazingly quick turns. It can be taken as a entertaining thrillerwhodunnit to who or even as a psychological study on egotistical domineering parents.Much of the Bottle Shock crew is back ... Alan Rickman Bill Pullman and Eliza Dushka. Add Mary Steenburgen Shawn Hatosy Outside Providence The Cooler Danny Devito and Ted Dansen and you have an odd but talented cast to deliver your odd but entertaining film.Alan Rickman plays the role he seems born to play ... arrogant selfdiagnosed genius. His family and coworkers somehow tolerate him despite his blindness to their own talents. This is especially problematic once Rickman becomes a Nobel Prize winner. Without giving anything away his son played by Bryan Greenberg Prime is kidnapped and held for the 2 million Nobel prize money ... by a guy with ties to Rickman's character. That is the simple part. After that the script flies through its twists and turns creating quite a mess of fun! Bill Pullman is the detective on the case and he draws from his voice pattern as the odd realtor in You Kill Me all while pining for Steenburgen ... who is a brilliant forensic expert in her own right. Danny Devito takes an odd turn as the Reformed OCD gardener who has a couple of memorable scenes. Eliza Duska the bar owner in Bottle Shock is quite memorable as the stunningly dark poet who captures Nobel Son's heart the evening before he is nabbed. Coincidence??? What I find most interesting about the script is that it could have focused on any number of story lines. Steenburgen Rickman and Dushka all have characters that could be developed further. But it really works here to have the division and balance.My only warning here is to be prepared for a Guy Ritchietype experience. There are times of rapidfire edits and crazy technomod music that will challenge your ability to follow along and keep up. I believe it just adds to the fun in this case.".

But I'm afraid that all I got was a jumbled mess that never really accomplished anything.The son of a Nobel Prizewinning chemist is kidnapped for ransom. There are a lot of interesting ways to take this story. The main problem is they take all of them. We have an opportunity to investigate what's really going on in the mind of the son how has his father affected his life why does the father live his life the way he does who is really responsible for the kidnapping and why... . The ways to explore this story are endless and instead of delving in wholeheartedly all that came out was a jumbled mess that left me feeling frustrated with no invested knowledge in any part of the story. Another review said the problem was too many cooks. I second that and will adapt the phrase from too many cooks spoil the broth to too many writers spoil the story. Only two screenwriters were credited but I'm willing to bet there were more with their hands in it.The actors were all quite good I'm sure. It's the characters that I'm more confused about. Whenever they presented a scene which echoed my experiences in the ivory tower of science they usually followed that up with a scene that didn't make sense based on what we knew about the characters. Perhaps I was focusing too much on specifics but I was continuously confused and frustrated by their characterization and story ideas. Too many writers ideas and lack of focus spoiled Nobel Son.".

	schema:headline " Crazy is just a choice  Nobel Son";
	schema:reviewBody "I admit that I love dark comedies. Something about the mixture of violence thrills and comedy just make a perfect amalgam of cinema to entertain my slightly offkilter sensibilities. When I saw that the film Nobel Son was opening up at the local theatre I vaguely recalled that the trailer seemed interesting and the cast recognizable. So I said what the hey? I think that the closest cousin I can manage to cull from memory would be the great underrated gem Suicide Kings from a few years back. Randall Miller's film isn't quite as entertaining as that one but as far as tone and feel go it resembles it well. Rather then a truly great story that stands up besides the jokes a la In Bruges Nobel Son falls into the trap of having many kooky characters that just happen to enter each other's lives to allow for the shenanigans. It feels as though the people were created first and then the story second letting the puzzle pieces fall into place. Don't get me wrong the eccentric players are part of the charm I just would have liked them to be a bit more real than so obviously playing for jokes and clichs.The tale itself isn't anything really new. Take any old kidnapping plot where the victim becomes a part of the plan and doublecrossing soon takes over upon completion erase a few adjectives and verbs and Mad Libs in the blanks to freshen it up. A jerk of a father wins the Nobel Prize for his work in the field of chemistry whereupon a man who may or may not be his illegitimate child whose mother's husband is whom the father's winning work was stolen from decides to kidnap the man's true son for the two million dollar purse. It's a bit convoluted and Miller enjoys throwing in chemistry jargon throughout to impress us whether what is spoken about molecules is even true don't ask me I kind of zoned during those passages. However the highly coincidental series of events and relationships does allow for it all to come together. The kidnapped son ends up proving to his assailant that he'd love to get back at his father any way he can and the two hatch an elaborate plan involving the full reconstruction of a car within two hours to steal the money clean and not let anyone get hurt  besides an innocent man soon to be without a thumb. Throw in a beautiful yet insane girl who you know is involved more than let on a detective on the case who is also in love with the hostage's mother a coworker and a reformed obsessivecompulsive tenant and you can understand how off the wall it could potentially get.Again the story is pretty airtight and coherent besides some logistical questions like putting a working car together in that short of time by one man putting a car in an above the garage apartment I think you have to look the other way on this one and just the sheer amount of photos and documents that are readily available to prove guilt. As far as motivations and intelligence all that is understood and believable. No one here is really likable at all everyone has an agenda and whether it took the events in the film for some to act on them or not they definitely weren't innocents. The Michaelsons are one messed up family that deserves the chaos but revenge is always served best cold I guess. And maybe it really is more vicious to devour a man while he is still alive then dead.Those story elements all pretty much run their course without pause so one doesn't get much opportunity to question it or care whether it is all kosher. Instead the real focus is on the characters. Those that standout are the ones with the most issues. Sure Alan Rickman does his usual smarmy best as the aging lothario professor with an ego that cannot be measured and Mary Steenburgen plays the cerebral analyst always looking and deciphering things before the cops on the case can but that kind of stuff is expected. Even the star Bryan Greenberg's Barkley the son of the aforementioned actors does his norm. Add a few corny cheeseball lines 80's music and delete the bloodyou'd think he came right out of October Road. No where the genius lies is in the criminals and supporting roles. Shawn Hatosy as the half brothermastermind has made a career out of playing semiintelligent headcases that switch from harmless innocence to manic homicidal delinquency. His Thaddeus James is the perfect villain here because what he does has merit so when it all starts to unravel his compassion is believable. My favorites though are Eliza Dushku as the love interest and Danny DeVito as the obsessivecompulsive. DeVito is hysterical as Gastner going through his mental checklists in a calculating monotone and nervous disgust. But if you want true insanity Dushku delivers in spades. As City Hall she is one messed up deviant. A psychopath girlfriend type her actions and artwork juxtaposed with her beauty and sexuality would make any guy confused and willing to play along.Nobel Son is a nice entry to the genre and a character piece with a lot of good. I appreciate that Miller tries to be creative and add his own flair but in doing so the aesthetic becomes a bit hohum and ordinary. The sharp cuts and blurring tricks help deflect what we see until the truth is revealed and the closeup camera work helps add a layer of detail for us to enter the movie yet it's all been done before. Even a gimmick that works at times becomes a little overkill with its abundance however that final tickertyped name and occupation caption made all the others before it worth the trouble.".

	schema:headline " Just a bad movie";
	schema:reviewBody "What a terrible rotten movie.To start with the character played by Alan Rickman the Nobel prize winner was not the least bit believable. It isn't that Rickman played the role badly but just that the character is not a believable character. If you were to come across this story as a novel I am sure that you would find the 1st chapter ridiculous and put it down and not finish it.I don't like movies that clearly are put together so as to convince me of one thing and then turn around and change things. This is not the same thing as a clever plot twist. Early during the kidnapping you naturally ask yourself if the son is in on the kidnapping. You look for evidence of that but the way that the scenes play out it is overwhelmingly apparent from his behavior and the behavior of the kidnapper that the son being kidnapped has no knowledge of the kidnapping. Then after doing everything that they can do to make you think this they reveal that the son is in on it. This simply bad move making. In fact it is simply awful. I wanted to leave but having paid for the ticket I sat through the rest of it and it only got worse.To pull off the retrieval of the ransom they do a vehicle switch which is staged inside a crowded shopping mall using a couple of Mini vehicles. The first problem with this is that there is no way in hades that a vehicle of that sort could move around like that in a crowded shopping mall without running into all sorts of stuff including people. It is ridiculous. The car that they used for the switch was shipped into the mall in parts and assembled during one night by one person. But the real problem here is how they managed to convert the read car that was on display in the mall into a car that could be controlled by remote control. They way that they did this as it really really was shown in the movie is that the accomplice set up a distraction and then slapped some sort of gadget onto the underneath of the car when no one was looking. Give me a break. In what fantasy land is it possible to convert a car to a full remote control merely by slapping some sort of gadget to the undercarriage? When this scene was shown it was not yet revealed what it was about and only later did it become apparent that this was how he supposedly converted that car to remote control. When I realized this that was when it was beyond apparent that this movie is just some cheap story that someone threw together in a few hours and then went out and hired some actors and a director and started filming. It is a bad bad story with an absurd plot.But as bad as all that was it got worse by an order of magnitude as soon as the kidnapping was pulled off and the son and the accomplice parted ways. What happens after than is so utterly preposterous that I can't even lower myself to telling you about it. The accomplice who is the bastard son of the Nobel prize winning father and by all evidence a genius in the first part of the movie now demonstrates that he is really really stupid beyond belief. It starts off not the least bit believable and just becomes increasingly less believable as the story progresses. What else can I say? This is just a very very bad movie and I cannot believe that there are so many people who would be even moderately entertained by such a bad story much less give it the high ratings that it is getting. If you are intelligent and enjoy a clever story you are going to be insulted by this bad story.".

When I realized this that was when it was beyond apparent that this movie is just some cheap story that someone threw together in a few hours and then went out and hired some actors and a director and started filming. It is a bad bad story with an absurd plot.But as bad as all that was it got worse by an order of magnitude as soon as the kidnapping was pulled off and the son and the accomplice parted ways. What happens after than is so utterly preposterous that I can't even lower myself to telling you about it. The accomplice who is the bastard son of the Nobel prize winning father and by all evidence a genius in the first part of the movie now demonstrates that he is really really stupid beyond belief. It starts off not the least bit believable and just becomes increasingly less believable as the story progresses. What else can I say? This is just a very very bad movie and I cannot believe that there are so many people who would be even moderately entertained by such a bad story much less give it the high ratings that it is getting. If you are intelligent and enjoy a clever story you are going to be insulted by this bad story.";

I began to break out in a nervous sweat and wondered if I hadn't wandered into another theater in my delusional state.Basically I feel as if this film was written by several different people who never once contacted each other. There are some decent ideas in all three or four of the genres which it sought to present. But apparently no single one human being ever read the script before production.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie demonstrates everything that's wrong with Hollywood.The overall story isn't that bad it's the execution. This movie is filled to the brim with myriad plot holes implausible situations and dialog lame humor and laughable attempts at poignancy. And if that's not bad enough it's also crammed with clichd sound effects unrelated trendy music and an array of uncalledfor camera tricks and 'cool' editing. There's so much absurd stuff here it would take me hundreds of pages to explain it all. Almost every aspect of this film is so implausible that right from the start I could not suspend my disbelief.It's as if the filmmakers decided to use every cool camera movement and editing that they ever saw and shoehorn it into this movie. That coupled with the bad music choices make the tone of this thing jump all over the place. It's disjointed and lacks a unified feel.Why are the characters introduced with typing across the screen? This is a pathetic clich that goes back to espionage type movies so why is it here? Who's documenting the case? This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. It tries desperately to be Frank Capra Alfred Hitchcock Spike Lee and Quentin Tarantino all rolled into one and it just doesn't work. Barkley narrates at the beginning and end of this movie. If it is supposed to be seen through Barkley's eyes then we've been cheaply duped because a ton of stuff has been left out that would have been shown to the audience. You can't have a character narrate and then hide what he sees and hears from the audience. It's a cheap trick.The tip of the iceberg of plot holes and implausibilities What is the purpose of the gardener character? He could be removed and the story wouldn't change one bit. And why was he murdered? It seems absurd that they'd kill him just to vacate the apartment. These are supposed to be brilliant people wasn't there a less illegal less violent way to accomplish that? And what's with linking OCD with electric cars? The filmmakers often try to make a correlation between things that don't correlate. The Pat Benitar thing was a sad attempt at making a poignant link between the brothers. And how convenient was it that he left City Hall's apartment without his shoes. No one I know has ever been in that much of a hurry. He couldn't just carry them along with his shirt? Like so much of this script it's unbelievably contrived.If there's been four thumbs taken in the last month wouldn't it be on the news? Wouldn't everybody know about it? And if so why is it crucial to send a thumb to show you mean business when everyone knows it's probably not the kidnap victim's thumb. And how did they get the MiniCooper in the apartment? Where did the brothers meet and plan it all? How did they know about each other? And Eli's dialog about molecules luminescing is overthetop sophomoric.Thaddeus spends a significant amount of time telling us how much of a horrible person his father is. Then instantly he wants his father to be proud of him and he wants to follow in his footsteps. What? He wants to steal other people's work and mess around with grad students and other people's wives? And Barkley seems like a dork even after we're shown that he's some kind of evil genius. I know a heck of a lot of Phds and not one of them ever played a Gameboy. And his mother is proud that he's an evil genius because I guess she's kind of evil too even though she appears to have lived a successful and upstanding life for the past 50odd years. Another cheap trick. OK we get that people aren't all bad or all good. What a revelation. I think I got it when I was ten years old. And just in case we didn't get the message Barkley actually tells us that during the opening credits.Fortunately City Hall lit one hundred candles near her bed on the roof just in case she brings home Barkley virtually a stranger many hours later. And wouldn't it be funny if Barkley woke up in the morning and stretched but forgot that he was naked and outdoors in bright sunlight and somebody saw him. Hilarious. If I was twelve years old again. Who's ever heard of mooshu? I've been eating mooshi for longer than Barkley's been alive.And we're spoonfed embarrassing amounts of exposition Thaddeus chronicling the gardener's history Eli's history etc. And just in case we missed the fact that City hall has done something twisted don't worry because right after she does it a song is played that tells us that she's a twisted girl. And Barkley tells his whole personal situation to a clerk at a caf. It's ridiculous. I've never seen such bad exposition. It's just lazy writing it really insults the intelligence of the viewer.There's the poetry reading place where predictably everyone's poetry is ludicrous except of course City Hall's. I mean this gag's got whiskers on it.And what's with the twisted logic of Sarah I hope it's Barkley's thumb. If it's somebody else's thumb then the kidnapper is a calculating psychopath. So by that logic if the kidnapper cuts off Barkley's thumb then he's a psychopath just not a calculating one. OK I'll be on planet earth if anybody needs me.You can't tell what's going happen because you're not given enough information. They've stacked the deck where you can't possibly figure it out and by the end there's so many ridiculous and implausible situations that you don't care. A mystery must include all the info needed to get it. Otherwise it's cheap trick which is what this is.".

It is an intriguing quirky mix of quickcutting edgy direction an outstanding cast and some unusually literate text and sophisticated injokes for the whoisdoingit rather than whodoneit genre. Randall Miller is the MTV director Miller and Jody Savin  each with a rather meager resume as a writer  are responsible for the winning script. It's rare and fortuitous these days to walk into a theater to see a movie whose plot you know and still be engaged and surprised. Such is the case here. With deliberate exaggeration and advance apologies I'd compare Nobel Son to Sleuth both for its titfortat nowyouseeitnowyoudon't continuous cliffhanger nature and the sense of amusement and fun even through some rather harrowing action. Son is like Sleuth in the true sense of that grossly abused word having some of the same characteristics. Only a great English stage actor such as Alan Rickman could make the silly cartoon figure of Eli Michaelson believable  and he does becoming sort of likable in his unfettered loathsomeness. Michaelson is rotten to the core antisocial beyond the worst case of Asperger's plus a miserable human being  and the winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Mary Steenburgen plays his longsuffering wife a character with a vaguely delineated past as a storied criminal investigator. Never too far from her is Bill Pullman a detective former colleague current shoulder to lean on. Bryan Greenberg is the son who  as you must know from all the ads and buzz  is held for ransom apparently by Shawn Hatosy a young actor who more than holds his own against the veterans in the cast. Danny Devito and Ted Danson show up unnecessarily but  in the case of Danson  not irritatingly. Eliza Dushku has a starturn debut as City Hall that's the name a looney poet painter and fornicator their word not mine. There is something inexplicable about the cinematography everybody in the cast looks like hell sans makeup sans Vaselinesmeared lens sans everything. Pullman wins the race to Showing All the Pores pastywhite as unattractive as possible but the others  including the women  are not far behind. A new trend? Makeup crew on strike? Who knows? For sure it's distracting but Son is too good to allow this stupid quirk to interfere.".

	schema:reviewBody "This wasn't all bad but it didn't seem to know where it was going. First of all the lousy music. This was intrusive too loud and in places even drowned out the dialogue. I found myself reaching for the remote to lower it every time the nutter came on. He was accompanied by crazy music to let us know he was crazy. Then you had to turn the sound up again to catch the next bit of dialogue. The music was terrible and sounded as if it was added at the last minute to change the direction of the movie in post edit. Then I realised what had happened. The original comedy movie had been made into a 'dark comedy' after shooting was over. The cannibalism mutilation kidnapping murders and beatings were a little too much for the review audiences so it had to become a thriller. The Woody Allen style poetry group and the presence of so many comedy actors Rickman Danson Steenburgen De Vito surely meant that this began as a comedy but someone one of the 5 producers ?  decided to change tack. Was De Vito originally meant to be more enhanced role and he was cut down to practically a cameo ? Why was Danson given only a few cutting lines as the University Dean ? Given Benny Hill style music or even a decent rock score but hey they have to be paid for the whole film would have been better. Why did this go straight to DVD here in the UK and then be given away in a newspaper ? I think a fine cast was let down here by a too many cooks effect and a corporate writing and editing debacle.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nobel Son is a labyrinthine clockwork plot that involves one of the trickiest slickest heists since The Italian Job or the first and second Ocean's films a con game with more twists and hairpin turns than a script by David Mamet on coke and a theme of desire for revenge that seethes even more after dubious narrative aboutfaces. The heist and con game film and the revenge story are a surefire mix for me. But I felt like I was trying to watch a great heist movie at a rave party. Whether techno music is good or bad it renders you a slave to its beat. But I wanted to be a slave to the movie's beat. It's difficult to do both. Hence the film is a more difficult viewing than it needs to be.As a philandering chemistry professor who as a laboriously detestable character drives the story by winning the Nobel Prize in Chemistry Alan Rickman is the definite anchor for the ensemble cast of characters all of whom are pawns in the script's scheme to weave the jazziest web the genre's seen in years. It could have easily achieved that goal were director Randall Miller contemplative enough to understand the effects of the audiovisual medium of film. There are not only sequences which require a much different kind of music but there are several sequences which would be much more impacting to the tension of the unraveling story's pace without overscoring at all. Nearly every American genre film has sequences handled in the less effective way but few of them soar into the depths of its extreme.Rickman is the flagship but Mary Steenburgen is no less charming as his wife. A woman can be married to a man like Nobel Prizewinning chemist Eli Michaelson purely by being masochistic deranged or in control of a deeply sophisticated feel for bitter sarcasm. But in spite of there being plenty of pleasant surprise in bit roles by Danny DeVito Ernie Hudson and Bill Pullman as well there isn't much room to talk about their performances which are compartmentalized into roles that serve more as functions than characters to create a remorseless plot.

	onyx:emotionText "Nobel Son is a labyrinthine clockwork plot that involves one of the trickiest slickest heists since The Italian Job or the first and second Ocean's films a con game with more twists and hairpin turns than a script by David Mamet on coke and a theme of desire for revenge that seethes even more after dubious narrative aboutfaces. The heist and con game film and the revenge story are a surefire mix for me. But I felt like I was trying to watch a great heist movie at a rave party. Whether techno music is good or bad it renders you a slave to its beat. But I wanted to be a slave to the movie's beat. It's difficult to do both. Hence the film is a more difficult viewing than it needs to be.As a philandering chemistry professor who as a laboriously detestable character drives the story by winning the Nobel Prize in Chemistry Alan Rickman is the definite anchor for the ensemble cast of characters all of whom are pawns in the script's scheme to weave the jazziest web the genre's seen in years. It could have easily achieved that goal were director Randall Miller contemplative enough to understand the effects of the audiovisual medium of film. There are not only sequences which require a much different kind of music but there are several sequences which would be much more impacting to the tension of the unraveling story's pace without overscoring at all.

Randall Miller who cowrote and coproduced with Jody Savin and also directed and edited this film did a wonderful job and deserves great respect. Every scene was captivating and fun with Bryan Greenberg and Shawn Hatosy proving themselves in starring roles.

In the hands of a lesser director that might be extremely boring but Jarmusch is a master of subtle understatement and great deadpan humor. This may be one of the funniest movies you've ever seen in which no one cracks a smile. Almost all the actors play themselves which adds a metatheatrical slightly surreal touch to it all. Among my favorite stories are one in which an overly eager Alfred Molina has a surprise in store for coolly arrogant fellow actor Steve Coogan and a great one in which Cate Blanchett plays both herself and her jealous cousin Shelby. Then there's the one where Tom Waits and Iggy Pop meet in a dive bar to discuss things and have a smoke to celebrate quitting smoking Jack and Meg White of the White Stripes experimenting with a Tesla coil and in the funniest casting RZA and GZA of the WuTang Clan sharing some downtime with of all people Bill Murray. I also like the one with Spike Lee's twin siblings Joie and Cinque dealing with an invasive waiter a hilarious Steve Buscemi. Almost all the stories are excellent but there are three that are very forgettable and pretty unnecessary and they're all in a row which disrupts the flow of the film. If those three had been taken out Coffee and Cigarettes would be just about perfect but it's still really good. And those three are out of the way in the first half anyway.For the first hour the movie feels mainly just like fun. Straightfaced deadpan BW comedy just like Strangers In Paradise. But as it goes on and strange connections are made between the stories it seems to have a sudden dreamlike depth to it. The final story in particular in which two old men in a dark room Bill Rice and Taylor Mead discuss life while on a coffee break that feels like it'll last forever has a distinct Waiting For Godot feel and ends the movie on a perfect note of haunting existential sadness.It was at that point that I realized I hadn't just watched a string of jokey short stories but a string of jokey short stories that say a lot about human nature and life in general. And if that's not enough to interest you how often do you get to see Tom Waits and Iggy Pop have a conversation? Or RZA GZA and Bill Murray?".

So what puts this film above all the pretentiously shot blackandwhite arthouse crap that is slugged out every year? For one thing it is really funny. From its expressionistic colors to the dialog that proudly smacks of absurdist humor this film is like a breeze of cool air utterly enjoyable from the first reel to the last that does not cloy on to the heart but is very unforgettable.Ultimately its unobtrusive absurdist humor which provokes chuckles instead of heartily laughs serves to prove the Pinteresquire themes of the futility of communication. We get a sense that the characters are isolated and desperately trying to touch each other through their speech but ultimately failing to do so and yet through their manic speech patterns and delirious pauses what is unsaid speaks more than what is said itself. While this unconventional style of humor is often difficult to pull off as it might fast become monotonous as evident in a recent stage production of The Caretaker that I saw Jarmusch's deft direction with his actors from their gestures to the way they hold their coffee cups pushes forth the humor and carries it on steadily throughout the entire film.It is hard to say much about a film who has nothing much to say. As in my favorite segment 'No Problem' the one with the two French black guys their dialog only serves to underscore the meaningless and nothingness of communication. What is scary about it is that it is so accurate that these type of conversations however ridiculous and absurd when portrayed on screen often typifies our daily conversations. It depresses me sometimes that human communication can be easily reduced to all these and this film makes the point entirely clear.So it definitely comes as a relief that as a conclusion the relatively more heartwarming vignette with the two old guys Champagne was chosen. Not only does it touches lightly on the recurring 'acoustic resonance' theme it also hints that we may in fact touch each other through common music or through a common idea. And it just happens that that common song was 'I have Lost Track of the World' by Gustav Mahler an amazing piece by an amazing composer that I have just recently began to love a delightful moment which shows that although we are as disconnected at the different vignettes in the movie it is comforting to know that we are still united in some weird cosmic way like this forum here. And like the two old guys after our coffee and cigarette break in which we step into an odd world that is not really unfamiliar we would have to step back in to the real world again. But it doesn't hurt to have a little nap in between and pretend bad coffee is champagne.".

I was tempted to fast forward all the other vignettes to get to the ones with these characters in but thankfully I never or I would never have seen 'cousins?'  Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan playing themselves in an absolutely perfect portrayal of the shallow sickening and repellent nature that comes with fame. Coogan takes the word 'scumbag' to new heights and Molina's keenness and almost innocence which slowly turns sour is perfectly pitched. Jarmusch has managed to capture the minutia of the trappings of fame so succinctly that sometimes it's difficult to watch. It's excruciatingly embarrassing but just gorgeous and has to be seen  several times. Likewise with 'somewhere in California'. Iggy and Tom play themselves but you can call Iggy Jim or Jimmy or Iggy or Jiggy if you like! Tom initially opts to call him Iggy but proceeds to refer to him as Jim throughout and so the offkilter banter begins. It's an hilarious portrayal of two guys who obviously have a mutual respect for each other's work but don't actually know each other that well. A series of ridiculous conversations and awkward silences ensue with Iggy becoming more and more animated and expressive to overcompensate for Tom's laidback yet defensive attitude. There are some excellent oneliners and it's just great watching these two giants chew the fat fighting their different corners and trying to keep their cool. I also thought Cate Blanchett shone in 'cousins' playing both roles as bitter cousin insipid famous cousin. It's another awkward horrible meeting between two people  one has made it the other hasn't and It's plain to see there isn't much love between them. We witness a series of underhand loaded and nasty comments all in the guise of friendship a friendship that only exists due to family ties. Coffee and cigarettes the movie is a bit like coffee and cigarettes the vice you'll get a buzz that's for sure. It's is an easy watch and each vignette has its qualities but as a whole it's a bit of a cheeky movie. It gets off on the fact that it has all these fab artists starring in it which goes a long way but not far enough. But I can't stress enough that it really is worth getting this movie out for the CooganMolina and PopWaites vignettes. Both priceless and essential viewing.".

On one hand a dark clever ingenious piece of cinema or on the other hand a dark clever ingenious piece of cinema. Jarmusch has succeeded in gathering as diverse a cast as you're ever likely to see the site of GZA RZA and Bill Murray waxing intellectual over smokers cough and herbal medicines is enough to interest even the most fervent sceptic of such work. Even the Cate Blanchett whom i'm not a huge fan of scene was so well set up and written or improvised who knows that you find your self unable to turn away so intent are you on what she has to say next. Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan are so wonderful as over blown versions of themselves Coogan as a super arrogant celebrity and Molina as a bumbling sweet excitable actor. Together they form what would be the best scene of the whole film that is if it wasn't for Iggy and Tom. Ah Iggy and Tom such characters such dialogue such a beautifully surreal piece. Iggy or Jim to his friends is more like an over nervous school boy than an ageing rock star and Tom is strong as the defensive perfectionist. All in all this film succeeds in what it tries to do if you like dark surreal comedy then you'll like this. Be warned though it will give you a craving for Coffee and Cigarettes.".

I didn't recognize the writerdirector's name though I really enjoyed Night on Earth and Dead Man and now I know his name. It was just so good to see this parade of tense interaction waiting on or predicting what would come next. I loved how some of the moments in the first vignette were mimicked in a later one by an entirely different set of people. I loved the stark interruptions of uncomfortableness loved watching all the people pour their coffee or tea loved the hilarious facial expressions of Molina and Cooganit seemed to me they were portraying the two most extreme British stereotypes interacting with each other and it was clearly fun for them. I enjoyed the cheap gritty sets the introductions and goodbyes. I am not sure who the movie would best play for as I sat and thought about who to share it with only members of my own family came to mind. We're all a bit quirky so the best way I can put it is that maybe if you like the mockumentaries of Christopher Guest but can appreciate an even darker twist you'll have a laugh at this.

The humor is better than in most full length feature comedies. I laughed loud and hard and had a lot of fun when I caught this at the university of Chicago's student movie theater. the real interest in this film is the social awkwardness created when people meet under false pretense or forced circumstance versus the natural comfort that is obvious between longtime friends who enjoy each others company.. The gestures and facial expressions by these great actors more than make up for the weaknesses of the film. The brothersister pairs show boredom and typical familial nitpicking. Iggy and Tom waits are brilliant. buschemi is a little misplaced in the scene where he shows up. my 2 favorite scenes that i feel show the real genius of jarmusch are 1. the moment when molina's gestures have revealed that he is not as indicated in the first review a sycophant but simply an honest and interested human being who is higher up in the scheme of things than the pretentious jerk he tries to befriend and 2.the scene where the old guy falls asleep and the camera zooms in on him for a moment revealing a great moment of humanity.".

It is a collection of eleven shorts where famous actors comedians rockstars and musicians played themselves. They drink coffee lots of it smoke and talk. While each segment is short we still can learn a lot about human nature.I read some comments and was surprised that there are so many negative opinions. Some users think that the movie was slow  I did not even notice how the time flew. Of eleven shorts six were wonderful and the rest  quite watchable. After I finished watching it I started all over and watched the ones that I loved for a second time. The best IMO are Somewhere in California with Iggy Pop and Tom Waits Cousins  Cate Blanchette plays a dual role  herself and her not so successful cousin and she is as good as ever in the dual performance These Things Will Kill You Joe Rigano Vinny Vella and Vinny Vella Jr Cousins?  easily the best in the bunch Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan Delirious  the funniest RZA GZA and Bill Murray and the final one the elegiac Champagne  Bill Rice and Taylor Mead.".

	schema:reviewBody "I read a whole host of reviews on this site before renting this film and despite all the warnings I gave it a chance. Hell I gave this film more than a chance. I had low expectations but this collection still failed to impress. First of all I can't even believe some of the reviewers on here had to point out that the shorts are in fact connected. Wow really? With every sketch featuring coffee and cigarettes dialogue that is reiterated in a number of sketches and every single damn sketch dealing with a part of the spectrum of social awkwardness interpreting the themes in this film and making your own connections does not make you an appreciator of finer things no it merely confirms that you aren't completely retarded.So let's get off our high horse and stop using the words metaphysical surreal and existential for a moment and look at what this film does have to offer. Yes the MolinaCoogan sketch is absolutely brilliant and hilarious. Had this been the only short released to the public then I never would have anything bad to say about Jarmusch. The Iggy PopTom Waits meeting comes in a close second comedywise. Not just a piece of great casting Waits gives such a natural performance that takes dry humor to a whole new level. Cate Blanchett's dual role is pretty cool and fun to watch but compared to Nic Cage's dual role in Adaptation which also came out in 03 this doesn't even come close.Beyond those three sketches I don't know what to say. Bill Murray gives a great performance that is ruined by two rappers who clearly needed better direction there's a sketch titled Renee that sets up a character who is almost OCD about her coffee and then goes nowhere with it Those Things'll Kill Ya plays like a scrapped Seinfeld sketch Twins features more bickering that is clearly meant to be comical but never works because there is no chemistry between the actors who are twins for Christ's sake. I could go on but its a waste of time. The problem is that Jarmusch keeps trying to tell a joke gets halfway there and then abandons the punchline because he's trying to paint a bigger picture. It's like sitting through 90 minutes of someone saying Knock knock who's there? We all get defensive when we're uncomfortable. And there is the biggest problem. This was never meant to be released as a movie. There's a lot to like about these sketches individually. Lots of tiny little nuances in the acting and very subtle humor that works for the short film format. But these should have been released on Youtube for people to discover on their own not as a film that has a character deliver a nice hamfisted epiphany at the end.".

	schema:reviewBody "Finally a movie my sister can get behind! With a title like 'Coffee And Cigarettes' health nuts must be having a collective heart attack. And the title isn't ironic. Every single episode in this stringofvignettes movie has enough java and smokes to murder a truck driver. Bizarro writerdirector Jim Jarmusch shot the flick over many years gathering a wildly disparate cast to costar in his black and white art film. No scenes are connected except by the everpresent cigs  a cup o' joe and each quirky sequence functions as its own selfcontained act.Most of the character's names are just the actor's names but that doesn't mean they're playing themselves. In reality Bill Murray might moonlight as a waiter and hang out with the WuTang Clan who always refer to him as billmurray one word. Jack  Meg White from the White Stripes might have a remarkable interest in science. And Cate Blachett might have a resentful rebellious cousin who looks exactly like her because she's playing both of them. But I doubt it. Those are just a few of the oddball sketches in this movie. In fact I mentioned those ones first because of the scenes with the bigname celebrities they're probably the weakest.Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan work together in the longest sequence. Molina is courteous and affable Coogan aloof and mildly interested in why Doc Ock has asked for this meeting. In a gem of warpspeed character development Molina goes from shy to eager to crushed to bitter. Both men are excellent. Also musicians Tom Waits and Iggy Pop have similar oilwater chemistry which is what makes their cultureclash oneupsmanship memorable. Roberto Benigni and Steven Wright set the tone with their jittery nonsensical opening scene. There's more but I've forgotten the rest already.So I didn't reveal much plot. What's there to tell though? The terrific MolinaCoogan sequence could be lengthened into its own movie but the rest of this picture wouldn't work if the short scenes played any longer. 'Coffee And Cigarettes' isn't really even about smoke rings or the caffeine rush. Jarmusch and the cast use those as props to create some zany bits with an opposites attract...or not motif. The flick is funny a bit too long and light years away from the mainstream. I enjoyed myself found my interest bobbing  weaving then left the theatre. That's okay. Even art films are allowed to be fast food.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jim Jarmusch's 2003 Coffee and Cigarettes is a pastiche of habits stereotypes monotypes and common sense. It's black and white and it is like a chess table with 11 sugar cubes. Each sugar cube is an individual totally independent vignette featuring actors caring their own names. Roberto Benigni is Roberto Steven Wright is Steven Cate Blanchett is Cate and her cousin in the same time Bill Murray is billmurray one word in a secret life as a bartender. Yes characters are talking about coffee and cigarettes most likely and in rest about nothing. Could be Jarmusch a big Seinfeld fan? Roberto meets Steven and keeps calling him Steve. He ends up taking his appointment to the dentist and leaves. Steven is perplex. Buscemi babbles with the Lee twins about Elvis's secret evil twin. Iggy Pop and Tom Waits they both have quit smoking. Therefore they can handle just one more cigarette happening to be on the table. Vinny and Rigano have a energetic argument about how damaging smoking is. Both have a rusty gruff voice. E J Rodriguez as a waiter tries to hit on Renee French. He fails sumptuously. Alex Descas and Isaach de Bankole Frenchmen and good old friends meet after a long time and it seems that they don't have a problem. Or do they? Cate Blanchett plays herself magnificently. Make he any hairstyle and will look good on her. She is also her hippy cousin. Meg and Jack White the White Stripes brothers quotes because they're not brothers or are they? have a conversation after 80 seconds of silence about his tesla coil an air transformer device. Meg turns out to be a costar to Jack's genius. Than we have Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan as possible cousins based on Molina's genealogic investigations. Alfred is extremely deferential. Steve hides his condescending propensity. Steve thinks Alfred wants to take advantage of him. But Alfred is honest. But there is catch. In the end the two reverse positions. How about the WuTang Clan? GZA and RZA talk about alternative medicine and how to perform a surgical procedure using an electric drillgun. Tom Waits became a doctor too. Coffee cause serious delirium. Billmurray one word doesn't think so and drinks from the jar. RZA explains how nicotine interferes with the central nervous system. That's paralysis. And last but not least Taylor Mead in the final scene lost his touch with the world. Bill Rice his partner is concerned. They listen to an imaginary Mahler in some backyard armory. Coffee is becoming champagne Nikola Tesla pops out in the conversation again and they ignore their age or their Parkinson and toast for the Moulin Rouge.Coffee and cigarettes that such an unhealthy combination! They all agree. We all agree. Jim Jarmusch's colorful interpretation is a celebration of life!".

If you actually liked this movie I would love  to talk to you because you are just kidding yourself. You think it's  cool to like movies that you don't understand when really you don't  understand them because they are crap and there's nothing there to  understand.  Here is a summary of Coffee and Cigarettes  The movie opens and it is shot in that terrible teen angst black and  white that kids who can't take pictures like to photoshop their digital  photos into because they think it will salvage an otherwise crappy  color photo. It doesn't salvage s and it just made me realize that  the movie was going to be pretentious crap just like all those  pretentious lookatmeI developmyownpicturesinblackandwhite  kids' pictures of kids playing in playgrounds photographed through the  chainlinks of the fence with the links in focus.  The movie is filled with a bunch of miniscenes of mediocre Blist  celebritiesactors having coffee and smoking cigarettes and talking  about coffee and cigarettes and occasionally making a comment about how  coffee and cigarettes isn't a very healthy lunch. It's artsy how they  keep repeating the title. Oh and it's artsy how all the tables are  black and white checkered. 'Cause the movie is in black and white get  it?  But wait. It's even more artsy to change the whole premise of the movie  halfway through when the tables stop having black and white checkers  and the coffee turns into tea and the cigarettes turn into one person  smoking and the other commenting on how cigarettes are terrible. Oh  and I bet it would be artsy if we insert a scene where Jack and Meg  White they're hot right now  they have that hit new album that in  retrospect no one really liked that much but they wanted to like it to  be alternative and artsy  oh there's that artsy thing again are  playing with a Tesla Coil. Then Jack should quote Tesla about the  world being a conductor of audiophonic harmony because  he's a musician. Then Meg white repeats the quote and hits a spoon on a  coffee cup and it makes an annoying ringing noise and then she  does it again and everyone is like stop it.  The movie carries on like this. The final scene is two old guys both  of which you've seen before but you're not quite sure where talking  about some piece of classical music. This is the scene where the movie  tries to redeem itself by having some deeper underlying meaning. The  one old guy says he wants to take a nap then he just dies. The  classical music plays obviously and the movie ends. Maybe he died  from lung cancer or caffeine overdose is that the point?  Pathetic.  The only redeeming scenes in the movie are the scenes with Steve Coogan  and Alfred Molina and Rza Gza and Bill Murray. But they are bookended  by the most worthless pretentious artrock deepermeaning  repetitive awkward crap I've seen in a long time.".

Ghost Dog while not bad felt as if the cast and crew couldn't really be bothered  and that is true of this film also. Coffee and Cigarettes is basically eleven stories revolving around people drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes. As with all films that have different parts the stories vary in quality but unfortunately there's more bad ones than there are good. Jarmusch has managed to collect a good variety of different actors and popstars to star in the film and this is one of the film's best points. As mentioned there is more disappointment than good stuff in this movie but the highlights of the movie include the section with The White Stripes' duo of Meg and Jack a discussion between Steve Coogan and Alfred Molina Steve Buscemi's Elvis theory and an odd little sketch where Cate Blanchett plays both parts.Jarmusch has opted to film this movie in black and white much like he's done with many of his earlier works and it does serve in giving the film a sense of cool. The film is very relaxed throughout and the two indulgences of the title give you an impression of this. However the relaxed nature of the film is also it's main drawback as throughout the movie we are given the impression that it is halfassed. The fact that it's just a series of sketches loosely tied together also gives this impression as it much easier to write a few conversations than it is to make a proper film. Like Quentin Tarantino has done with all of his movies Jarmusch has dressed this shallow movie up in a whole host of talent and it does make the end result more enjoyable. Jarmusch regular Roberto Benigni appears in a forgettable short at the start of the film and after that we see the likes of Iggy Pop Steve Buscemi Alfred Molina Bill Murray Cate Blanchette and Steve Coogan among other. Seeing all these guys in a movie together is nice for a movie fan like myselfbut I just cant help thinking that the movie doesn't seem to have any actual effort put into it hence the low rating.".

Anyway I watched it with my sister who immediately got bored of it because it was filmed in black and white she's a texting nut and cellphone zombie. I loved this movie though it introduces you to an average variety of people from different walks of life different genders classes races but they each share one thing in common they all visit a small city coffee shop dingy and unpopular and most of the characters have an addiction to either coffee cigarettes or both.As the movie goes on the characters complain about the small problems in their lives indulging in their addictions and sort of looking down on one another unkindly though other characters hit it off with each other. Still despite these characters having next to nothing in common many of their complaints and problems in life are similar and they aren't alone in these issues. This movie doesn't really have much of a beginning middle or end it's more like an artistic view of how much we take the little things in life for granted little things like friendly service in a diner a nice compliment the smell of freshlybrewed coffee and lit cigarettes so many small things we often forget and overlook.Though I'm not entirely certain I think it may take place in the late Fifties to early Sixties the music style scenery and fashion shown in the movie would point in that direction. The acting was outstanding and the soundtrack was nostalgic the black and white film choice really puts more focus on the characters than the scenery so to fully enjoy this movie you have to focus more on the script and what is being said as well as the facial expressions and actions of the characters to put the movie all together. I really loved this movie and I think it definitely deserves 1010 stars it's nice to avoid the melodrama of romance movies cheap jump scares of horror movies and bad effects of scifi movies and just watch something simple yet so complex sometimes. In the end it leaves a lingering depression and a new view on life that maybe in the fastpaced world of the city we often forget how much life is a gift and human kindness is worth a lot more than you'd think.".

In this film we see a handful of such meetings involving all sorts  famous singers cousins twins strangers or even just people by themselves. As in real life the moods aims and directions of each meeting are different and end different ways for the characters involved and well that's about as close to a plot summary as I can get! As a lover of short films I was looking forward to seeing this film because it seemed to be a collection of shorts made over quite a period rather than being a collection of vignettes as in say Blue in the Face. However it quickly became evident that these segments would mostly not stand up on their own in the way a good short film would and they are much more just like sketches rather than shorts. Anyway aside from the issue of definitions this is still a very hit and miss affair with the majority being nearmisses of halfhits only a couple of them would I watch again on their own. Strange to Meet You is not that good Twins is interesting and was a curiosity to me for having two of Spike Lee's siblings in it Renee didn't do anything for me No Problem was cool but pretty empty. However I did think that Somewhere in California was strong Those Things Will Kill Ya was obvious but quite enjoyable Cousins was interesting and engaging Cousins? was sharp and enjoyable while Delirium was strangely comical although I probably enjoyed it more for the people than the content.The cast do reasonably well within the material but I think some are better than others as you might expect I was more impressed with the acting in the shorts that I found most interesting  although I recognise that that is probably an unfair judgement of the performances. The direction is fairly static but also quite stylish and with a nice sense of place in each location the black and white perhaps adds it more credibility but other than that I didn't see the reason other than maybe adding a consistency in colour that the material didn't provide.Overall this is not as good as I had hoped but in fairness maybe I had my hopes unreasonably high. It does do what it claims to do by being a mixed collection of sketches all of them are good enough to fill their short running times but not all of them are worth seeing. The weak ones and the good ones come pretty much 5050 and you need to decide for yourself whether or not those odds make it worth your while. Fans of Jarmusch and offbeat films will likely enjoy it but I reckon the casual viewer may end up left a bit cold and unimpressed by it.".

Most of the material carries that bothersome almost funnylabel. Steve Buscemi's theory on Elvis and his twin brother is almost funny but then again no. Teaming up a nearinsane Bill Murray with guys from the WuTang Clan well that was funny. Both The White Stripes and Alfred Molina have a pretty good segment too but all in all I just felt bored with the whole thing. I like the idea but some good writing wouldn't have hurt.".

My recommendation for you the potential viewer is this If you're a rabid fan of anyone appearing in the film then go for it.

I'm sure you encounter this in lots of places as well situations people and philosophies.He attempts highly engineered ordinary events that have no content. That aimlessness is the point. His art is in designing the lack of ordinary film order in such an extreme but directed way so that we get the message by its omission. This technique allows him to come down on the side of characters rather than composition.Its an old contest usually between the orchestration of the filmmaker and the instrument of the actor. But he completely reframes the question. That's why he is important and his films and particularly his book film Ghost Dog should be watched.Along the way he's discovered that all situations are conversations and no matter how complex things get the conversation is always between just two people. To prime his pump he sketches just like most artists. You have to take such sketches on their own terms as ancillary to stuff with substance even if with him substance is subtraction.Others have already told you that these sketches are uneven. There is no consistency of tone among them in fact they are so disconnected we infer what you likely have already read these were done across huge chasms of time philosophy and technique sliding into the notion of encounters and communication as resonance.My own favorite by itself makes this worth watching. Cate Blanchett is our most accomplished folded actor meaning she can convey two characters in one performance. Here she literally plays two characters conversing with one another. She obviously wrote the dialogue because each phase slips under the one from the companion. It is her interpretation of a Jarmusch situation an emotional encounter drained of all the theatrical conventions of emotion. Great.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

Two minutes' worth of concept was regularly dragged out to ten minutes. The dialogue was halfconsidered if that. Vignettes ground painfully away towards some illconceived inane punchline. The performers even granted that they had little to work with were visibly floundering given that they were for the most part playing themselves they never came across as people who actually existed or that they had any reason to talk to the people playing opposite them most often they couldn't even convince me that they had ever actually drank coffee before. Only Cate Blanchett walks away from this carwreck with any dignity intact.I'm normally quite generous in my ratings but this movie was simply insultingly bad. Jarmusch should have kept the only print locked away in a vault with instructions that it be burnt following his death.210 and that's only because I smiled when Bill Murray drank straight from the pot.".

Somehow it has the same kind of humor as Seinfeld there is no storyline the movie focuses on somewhat pointless but very funny conversations.The ingredients are so simple coffee and cigarettes and the result is really stunning. The only thing thats striking about the conversations is that some mind games are being played between the actors. Especially the story between two guys who meet up after a couple of years.".

The movie is extremely poetic but at the same time the visuals are firmly grounded in reality and the buzzing of insects in the outdoors is omnipresent. The plot is simple a student is spending a summer back in his home village taking care of his grandfather on his deathbed while dealing with his own growing up. The movie allegedly contains the most erotic scene in Czechoslovak cinema  when the youngster watches a woman bathing in the river.The title translates into English as A Romance for Fluegelhorn.

The scenery of Argentina is absolutely beautiful.The music used in this film was absolutely beautiful and went perfectly with each scene especially a scene between Mia and Manuel in a certain hotel room. This movie was a perfect way to end the beloved television series. It is a marvelous coming of age movie about friendships and love and how our memory is something to cherish. This movie was absolutely positively completely and totally wonderful and Beautiful and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves Erreway as much as I do.".

Besides from the band issues the only real story developed in the movie is Mia's and Manuel's leaving the other couple behind only to kiss almost at the end of the movie which comes totally out of the blue like lots of situations in the entire movie. Finally it has a script full of clichs and a break of that with some songs that can make your hears blow awfull voices even worst lyrics. Maybe the only thing that can keep you eyes open is the beautiful view of the north of the country that is shown.".

A Scary Killer  Someone so intimidating and terrifying that just the sheer thought of them coming after you gives you goosebumps.3. A Good Pace  This is what a lot of slasher movies get wrong and this was one of the main problems I had with the first film. You don't want to take too long to get the kills going.Cold Prey 2 succeeds in all 3 of these aspects very well. The Killer is terrifying the characters are likable and things get going almost right from the start. Plenty of gore for the gore hounds and plenty of kills. If you were not a fan of the 1st film I still suggest you give this one a try. Its a great ride 910".

	schema:reviewBody "An sequel that is just as good and kick ass as the original! I thought it was more violent and action packed this time around but not overly done because just like in the original it focused on suspense and scares and character development more than gore and torture which is very rare in slashers these days. I thought the acting was just as strong or even better than in the original with our strong heroine female lead who I think is very sexy Hollywood should recruit her! There is not one dull moment in this film and is more fast paced than the original but it also has a build up too and is twice as entertaining and thrilling but the things that kept me from giving it a full 5 star rating is that it kind of lost its slasher touch making it more like an actionthriller with an body count and was less scary. The last half was fantastic though and kept me on the edge of my seat and had me rooting for the lead to survive and the film leaves it open for a Cold Prey 3 and I can't wait! Overall this is the best slasher series I've seen since maybe Scream 1 and 2 because to me it's near perfection when it comes to slasher flicks and I highly recommend it for fans of the genre. More of a 4.5 out of 5 stars. SEE IT ASAP!!! AS WELL AS THE FIRST ONE IF YOU HAVEN'T YET!".

	schema:reviewBody "The sequel to the brilliance that was Cold Prey does it again with this excellent follow up.The Plot  This picks up exactly where the last one left off where Jannicke is picked up from the side of the road dazed confused and full of blood is taken to the local hospital which in fact is closing down where only a few members of staff are working there and a handful of patients but when the police find the bodies of her friends and killer and are brought back to the hospital the killer comes back alive and starts pickaxing his way through the hospital.Wow very rarely we get a sequel that matches the original but this one actually does and again hits all the right notes where in the first one was mostly character development in this one we get a bigger body count and more action which again I always love. The killer yet again was genuinely creepy big brutal and is even more nastier like the scene with the nurse and the fire extinguisher really brutal.Again like the first one we get a build up of the main characters and then kicks into gear gives nearly an hour's worth of sweet action as the survivors attempt to avoid the mountain man and exit the hospital in time for more police to arrive. The death's are pretty bloody but sadly there's not a lot of onscreen gore. Although there are a couple somewhat creepy scenes a lot of the great mood and atmosphere that the first had is lost in this one. That's essentially the price you have to pay when you want a feature with lots of action elements which in my opinion make for a more entertaining watch depending on the story.A factor I liked about this movie was that we get more of a back story on the killer this time which really kept me interested and I even wanted to find out more and more and the cast were again decent I liked the fact that they were normal looking people and not fashion models The killer also makes for an interesting hunter laying down a couple traps for our victims to find themselves caught in proving that he's also fairly intelligent. The final scene was just pure brilliance and doesn't suck like a lot of movies I've seen.The cast well Ingrid Bolso Berdal Jannicke does it again I was glad that she survived the first time round and this time she's just as great becoming more of a action babe this time round without going over the top which I liked and Marthe Snorresdotter Rovick Camilla was an interesting addition to the cast as the Doctor she made a very sympathetic character and not just another crying and sobbing supporting player she really comes into her own especially towards the end.All in all while the first one delivered mood and atmosphere this one delivers old school action slasher with an intimidating and potentially iconic killer and another must see. I can't wait for part 3.".

The camera work and sound effects are very and I found the acting even better than in the first movie with Ingrid Bols Berdal once again giving an excellent performance as Jannicke the only survivor of Fritt Vilt 1. I can't really express an opinion on the dialogs as I watched this film in Norwegian and only understood most of it because I speak some Swedish.Spoilers begin        Why did I not find it as good as the first movie then? First of all what made Fritt Vilt I really good was the setting the characters were stuck in an abandoned hotel in the middle of nowhere surrounded by high snow which made any attempt to escape very difficult. In the sequel they are in a hospital and a few of the characters could have run out of it earlier than they actually did. Besides the script has a few flaws that impact the realism of the storyline 1 If you are a policeman when your foot gets caught in a trap and you are being dragged into a dark room amazingly faster than the 2 other policemen only a few feet away can run you'll surprisingly think of using your MP5 to try keep yourself out of the dark room instead of shooting! 2 If you are a policeman and are left in the car while 3 others enter a dark hospital with a homicidal maniac insideyou'll wait till everybody else is probably dead to load your gun and get out of the car! 3 When the homicidal maniac  who has killed all your friends 1 doctor 1 nurse and 5 policemen  manages to disappear you decide to go after him but you obviously forget about the Glock you were holding in the hand and only bring the shotgun and a knife! 4When you are waiting for the homicidal maniac after signing the guest book you obviously fall asleep! 5 If you are nurse when your favorite patient decides to hunt down the homicidal maniac who just killed your boyfriend you first think about it for a couple of hours then make up your mind and run home to grab your hunting rifle but make sure not to call anybody for help!The final scene is neat though how to put it? Revenge is a dish best served in the cold!        Spoilers endAll in all I can recommend watching this horror movie for its genre is definitely well done!".

Maybe it's the image most people have of it being desolate cold dark and isolated. It might also have something to do with the fact that 90 percent of the music we hear coming out of the country is death or black metal. Cold Prey II definitely doesn't help give movie audiences an alternate view of what to expect if you plan a ski trip to that part of the world.After surviving a horrific killing spree at an abandoned ski lodge a college girl named Jannicke Ingrid Bols Berdal is taken to a remote hospital for treatment. She tells her story to the local police who decide to investigate her claims. They return hours later with the bodies of her four friends and the mountain man responsible for the massacre. Unfortunately the monstrous murderer isn't dead and begins slaughtering the patients nurses and doctors in his mission to finish what he started with Jannicke.Cold Prey II is the perfect example of a modern slasher film done right. Although it brings nothing new to the table it manages to keep up a level of suspense and delivers some legitimate jump scares at the same time.I couldn't shake the feeling that director Mats Stenberg and writer Thomas Moldestad were doing their own version of Halloween II and Friday the 13th The Final Chapter for a Norwegian audience. Like those classic 1980s films much of the action takes place in a hospital. The vision of the giant killer in Cold Prey II standing at the end of a corridor with the lights blinking reminded me of the same type of scenes in the sequels to John Carpenter and Sean S. Cunningham's iconic originals.Cold Prey II is a welcome addition to the slasher genre. It's not doing anything new but continues passing the torch to a new generation of horror fans and filmmakers. It will give viewers a sense of hope we don't get much anymore when it comes to these types of movies.httpcontributor.yahoo.comuser849014ericshirey.html".

	schema:reviewBody "Logically unfolding sequel to the supremely atmospheric and haunting Norwegian horror hit Cold Prey released two years prior. Sole survivor Jannicke gets picked up by the side of a snowy road and taken to a nearby hospital that is as good as empty due to being closed very soon. She's in shock and nobody believes her grotesque story about the pickaxe wielding maniac that butchered her friends. They're forced to sing a different tune when the five cadavers are recovered from the ravine and brought back to the hospital morgue. The police also discovers a few dozen of other frozen corpses including that of the killer. He really must be Jason Voorhees' distant Scandinavian relative as he miraculously resurrects from his body bag. The medics successfully attempt to bring him back naturally much against the will of a hysterical Jannicke and she's obviously right to protest as he promptly continues his relentless killing spree. Meanwhile the local police commissioner digs up the 30yearold missing person file and discovers a handful of interesting personality details about our deranged killer. Cold Prey II is a more than worthwhile successor of the original this time with a sinister abandoned hospital setting instead of an abandoned skiing resort setting. Also like in the original the characters are identifiable and amiable individuals and you certainly don't wish for them to die in such barbaric and excruciatingly painful ways. Like the cute blond nurse who's being smashed to death with a fire extinguisher for example. Ouch! The sequel is actually even slightly more suspenseful than the first film because there's a more intense aura of mystery hanging around the killer's persona. The first half hour is particularly scary prior to his resurrection because you can't really guess which direction the writers have chosen for this film. There are nicely eerie decors and set pieces great use of ominous music and always the exact right dose of lighting. Let it be clear that these Norwegians definitely know how to generate the right mood for an atmospheric and nightmarishly intense horror film. Cold Prey II also benefices from terrific acting performances including the one from the little kid. The last half hour follows a very exciting catandmouse game between the killer hiding somewhere in the hospital the two female survivors and a bunch of policemen. These sequences are authentically scary. When is the last time a slasher actually scared you? The finale is brilliant and Jannicke unfolds herself as one of the most prolific and heroic female horror protagonists of the last decade. There's another entry on the way apparently a prequel set in the 1980's. I for one cannot wait!".

She's taken to the local hospital where she reveals the story of the massacre of her friends at the ski lodge by the masked psychopath Geir Robert Follin who replaced the first film's Rune Melby. Upon investigating the scene of the crime the police discover  retrieve the corpses of Yannicke's friends along with the murderer. Unluckily for the staff and patients of the hospital however Dr. Hermann Fridtjov Sheim decides to play hero and save the vicious mass murderer who had shown brief signs of life. This spells bad news for everyone as Geir breaks free and goes on yet another vicious murder spree through the hospital.Taking an obvious page from the book of the 'Halloween' franchise rookie filmmaker Mats Stenberg taking over for the first film's director Roar Uthaug moves the 'Fritt Vilt' story out of the lodge and into the hospital very much like Laurie Strode's experience in 'Halloween II.' It seemed at first that this sequel would lose the feel of the first film due to the change in location but it ended up not losing a beat at all. In fact everything in this sequel seemed boosted by the location change. The story gets moving quickly but still manages to get in enough character development to give viewers a bit of interest for the soontobe victims. This is a very refreshing as the slasher subgenre is famous for its lack of character development using characters more as props for the killer to slaughter in various ways. But worry not the characters here still suffered their own share of vicious  creative murders. Along with the brutality of the kills we're given some fantastically well done  realistic gore scenes. However the film is not solely about the slasherstyle scares  kills. In fact 'Fritt Vilt II' has some of the best suspense and buildup I've seen in this subgenre for a long time. Due to the small cast there had to be a good balance of suspense  an entertaining pace and the film delivered beautifully.As far as the technical aspects go the film is top notch for the subgenre. While the story may not be the most original or unpredictable the approach works very well made even better by director Stenberg's execution. A positive that many fans will notice is the realism of the return of the killer. Instead of the typical JasonMichael sit up  kill reanimation Geir is actually given a genuine reason for coming back and that is another welcome element. The cinematography of Anders Flatland is both beautiful and effective. He manages to show us precisely everything we need to see in interesting ways without pulling the reveals too quickly. The cast as well did very well in their individual roles. Although very few of the characters had to pull off overly complex characters Yannicke definitely had some substance to work with and performed very well as one of the most badass final girls that's come to the slasher subgenre in a while.Overall 'Fritt Vilt II' is a fantastic entry into the genre and is a contender as one of the best slashers of the decade being one of the few films that may allaround surpass its predecessor.Final Verdict 8.510 AP3".

	schema:reviewBody "Cold Prey 2 to me is Halloween 2 Norwegian style. It takes place right after the events of the first film as our heroine from the first is taken to a nearby hospital. In essence Cold Prey 2 is a fusion of Halloween 2 and Friday the 13th Part 4 The final Chapter but again it has its own stamp and it stands alone and proud in the slasher genre. Cold Prey 2 doesn't bring anything new to the table other than it is a full throttle attack on the senses. Our killer is one mean son of a gun and his image is not far off Kane Hodder's Jason in Friday the 13th Part 7 The New Blood.

	onyx:emotionText "Cold Prey 2 to me is Halloween 2 Norwegian style. It takes place right after the events of the first film as our heroine from the first is taken to a nearby hospital. In essence Cold Prey 2 is a fusion of Halloween 2 and Friday the 13th Part 4 The final Chapter but again it has its own stamp and it stands alone and proud in the slasher genre. Cold Prey 2 doesn't bring anything new to the table other than it is a full throttle attack on the senses. Our killer is one mean son of a gun and his image is not far off Kane Hodder's Jason in Friday the 13th Part 7 The New Blood. Again we are treated to some great atmosphere and settings that are dark brooding and foreboding at the best of times. Throw in some great kills and you have one of the better horror sequels in some time. On to review Part 3.";

I really love how the writerdirector takes their the time for us to LIKE the characters. I CARED about them and didn't want to see them hurt unlike some of the horror movies where the characters are almost annoying and w kinda LIKE to see them killed off.It just makes for a more roller coaster of an emotional ride. Again the subtitles were unusually easy to follow while watching the movie. The setting this time around is a hospital. Again reminiscent of the Halloween circa 1980's movies. And yet again the acting is superb the special effects blood etc were very well done without going overboard into shock territory. The pacing even better in this second movie. Very rare do we see the second installment even better then the first but I agree with most other viewers who liked this one even better! Norway has really come thru for us fans who enjoy this type of horror. Excellently done and highly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen the first film of the series I was really looking forward to this one. Fritt Vilt should definitely be remembered as Norway's lead Slasher though I haven't had any chance to see any other Norwegian Horror films. Instead of writing this review as I usually like to separating the good from the bad I've decided this time to write my thoughts in the chronological order they've occurred.First of all  Cold Prey 2 picked up pretty much exactly where Cold Prey ended and was an actual sequel rather than a film that only used the same location or same slasher. It even used the same surviving girl from the first film. A very good thing in my opinion! Unfortunately something about her hair was different. It wasn't as obvious as Mark Hamil's total makeover between The Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi but it was still noticeable and slightly hurt suspension of disbelief.Second  Slasherwise this sequel unfortunately pretty much devastated all the greatness of the first film. While in the first film the characters were up against a man larger and stronger than average and completely crazy but still a man in this one the Mountain Man had become this Jason Voorhees adaptation. Suddenly  his strength levels in the superhuman and a wrench thrown directly at his head has barely any effect. A let down... However the background story attached to this phenomenon was dark murky and original. Still better off with just human slashers I say either make the film a monsteraliens film or one with human villains. Most importantly  be persistent if the first film presented the slasher as a man don't make him a superhero in the 2nd.Third  the ending while having no twists and no exceptionally wise turn of events was still very original and well done! Excellent acting by Ingrid Bols Berdal despite her hair and a great way to finish the story while leaving some potential loose ends for the third film.Coming to think of it now that I reread the aforementioned notes I think I liked this film even more than the first one! What a pity that based on the rules of 99 of trilogies the third one is going to be lousy  Let's hope it isn't!".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Brad Davis Johnny Modine in a 1987 cop thriller set in LA with him looking for the killer of his dad Sam Modine William Lanteau and finds a whole lot more then he bargained for in the process. The movie Cold Steel has the distinction of being the first and last film directed by Mario Puzo's who wrote The Godfather daughter Dorothy Ann Puzo. Being a firsttime directed film it isn't exactly a modern FilmNoir classic or topflight police action drama but it is quite watchable. The pacing by Ann does move the movie along with a number of shoot outs and an incredible car chase scene that ends up in of all places at a racetrack. The final scene in the film with Johnny having it out with the badguy in the movie Jonathan Banks Issac the Iceman and his mob at the new LA Police Headquarters construction site is a real thriller. The climatic and exciting scene is as good as anything that you'll see in films similar to Cold Steel like Die Hard. Brad Davis though very likable in his role as policeman Johnny Modine is a bit off when it comes to being a tough and expert law enforcement officer.You can forgive Johnny early in the movie when he's a bit too aggressive with a robber he arrested at a grocery store in the police station. It was days after his father was murdered and Johnny wasn't exactly interested in following the law by the letter where a person is innocent until being proved guilty as well as him only being the cop not the judge and jury. But Johnny falling for Kathy Connors Sharon Stone who walked into his life or bar and practically threw herself at him should have been something that Johnny should have been very suspicious of. Johnny should have known that the drop dead gorgeous looking Kathy wasn't exactly interested in his striking good looks as well as his very refined social graces. Johnny was almost on the floor slouching on a chair at the bar drunk when Kathy first met him.It later turned out that Kathy had a very personal reason to get to know Johnny and become very friendly with him and it wasn't love at first sight in order to set him up for the kill by Issac who murdered his father. Sharon Stone has a much broader range of acting then you would have expected her to have in a Bmovie like Cold Steel and showed the talent she had back then in 1987 that later made her one of the top ranking actresses in motion pictures that she later became.Everybody in the movie seemed to be really enjoying themselves in their roles and it showed on the screen with the film never bogging down and becoming boring. The big secret in the movie about Issac killing Johnnies father as well as Issac's connection with Kathy who's brother Eddie Michael Warren was a major factor in her allying herself with him. Kathy trying to kill Johnny was a bit strange and unusual but still interesting and did make sense to Kathy at least. Jonathan Banks' Issac was a better then average psycho drug addicted killer but the idea of giving him a gang when he would have been better as a lone killer who's job seemed to be committing robberies to get money to buy Issac drugs was a bit far fetched to say the least. The reason for that was because he didn't want anyone to see his face! That's what Issac kept saying over and over in the movie. If anyone did like Johnnies father and the Fishman Ron Karabatsos Issac murdered them as if he were some very well known and wanted criminal who would be recognized by anyone as soon as they saw him! Yet both Johnnies father and the Fishman who were killed by him had no idea who the heck Issac was when they saw him! It was sad to see Brad Davis in one of his last movies before he died of AIDS in 1991 and realize what a great talent he was and how many good films and theater performances he would have giving the public had he lived. The movie Cold Steel is a fair and modest action film but it didn't give Brad who did the best he could with his role in the movie the opportunity to show the public the fine actor that he really was.".

This Ingmar Bergman retrospective has certainly been the one with the loosest viewing schedule which isn't to the project's detriment. With a filmmaker like Ingmar Bergman one with pronounced themes to his films it is interesting to see how he carries out those themes in each period of his work. In his 1948 film Port of Call Bergman examined the intricacies of human existence through the eyes of a suicidal factory worker desperate to escape the weight of her overbearing mother. Starring NineChristine Jnsson and Bengt Eklund Ingmar Bergman perfectly explores the struggle of living a life free of the strains of complicated human relationships and the prisons of our own minds that many are often unable to escape from.Berit NineChristine Jnsson recently released from reformatory school following an attempted suicide is back under the thumb of her manipulative and overbearing mother. She sees a way out when she meets Gsta a man she is able to convince is the first one to experience her passions. Berit unable to properly experience love sees Gsta as not only a way to break free from her mother's influence but also to escape her laborious job at the factory. A marriage would also prove to Berit's social worker that Berit was establishing a stable foundation for herself and would be free from the threat of returning to the reformatory school. Her plans for freedom with Gsta are foiled however when he cannot forgive her past.Family troubles especially overbearing or neglectful parents are a constant theme in the films of Ingmar Bergman and apparently have been since his earliest features. The intricacies of familial disconnect are fascinating and Bergman tunes into those intricacies in a way I have seldom seem from other filmmakers. One of my favorite aspects of Bergman films is how he illustrates the brokenness of people and how that brokenness contributes to their inabilities to form successful relationships. I continue to be amazed how keenly Bergman tapped into the human spirit. Another mainstay in Bergman's filmography is how often he depicted people working jobs they don't like in order to maintain lives that were personally unfulfilling. Much like in Summer with Monika our protagonists in Port of Call worked jobs that robbed them of their essential human fulfillment and left them in a constant state of emotional exhaustion. The only place to relieve the stresses of the world is in the cinema. The scene in which Berit has removed herself from every disappointment of existence when she is freely laughing in a crowded theatre was extraordinary. It reminded me of the scene in Louis Malle's Au revoir Les Enfants where the only place everyone was equal and could enjoy themselves was during a screening of Charlie Chaplin's The Immigrant. Cinema as an artistic medium has relieved the pressures of existence since its inception and Ingmar Bergman films are no exception to this rule.".

	schema:reviewBody "While Gosta a seaman arrives in Gothenburg a young girl Berit makes a suicide attempt in the city harbour. After saving her a rather promising relationship seems to begin but much work needs to be done from both of them in order to be together. In 1948 Ingmar Bergman seems already familiar with the themes that he will never stop examining throughout his career. He observes and studies human behavior in everyday circumstances in an effort to get a glimpse of its roots. Berit is depressed but her situation has a long story starting from her childhood. Growing up with a mother that never cared for anything and anyone but herself and a father that had a problem hiding his temper she ended up in a reform school and the implications are therefore predictable. Gosta has just finished working in the ships and he finds himself working in the docks of Gothenburg despite his ambition for something bigger. They are both in the need of a clean start in their lives carrying their burdens from the past on the left and their dreams for the future on the right. When they first meet they can't possibly imagine how similar they are. In fact they seem incapable of realizing anything because of the wall they have built around them in order to protect themselves. But she desperately needs to free herself from her mother who impersonates all of her past and he desperately needs to find someone to relief him from his loneliness. So they will fight through all the difficulties for these goals. Eventually she will learn to have some faith in other people he will learn to forgive and they will both learn to face the past. This film also works on a political level as the story takes place among the dock workers struggling everyday just for the essentials. Bergman himself admits the influence that the Italian NeoRealists had on him in his first films and Port of Call is a characteristic example. It is mostly shot on location and the work in cinematography is really admirable the black and white photography and the camera movement is stunning and Bergman proves how talented he is when it comes to framing. The leading actors give notable performances especially NineChristine Jonsson. Overall Port of Call is an interesting film a typical example of the first period in Bergman's filmography that will reach its climax with Summer with Monika. The story may sound clichd and nave at times but it is its honesty that engages its viewers as well as the masterful shots of the great Swedish director.".

	schema:reviewBody "An early film from Ingmar Bergman it is just as interesting on a visual scope as his films usually are with the docklands filmed well and good use of panning and dolly work throughout. In terms of story and acting though this is rather ordinary stuff despite some interesting ideas and philosophies about freedom. It seems the easy way to out to just classify this film as interesting but not up to the standard that Bergman would later set however I cannot think of much else to say here. It certainly is not as thoughtprovoking and intense as some of his later films and for those not interested in Bergman or clever camera movement I could easily imagine this piece coming across as boring.".

	schema:headline " The influence of neorealism on Bergman";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a very nice early Ingmar Bergman film one that's well composed touches on daring subjects and has a gritty neorealist feel to it. Via flashbacks and nonlinear storytelling we gradually come to understand a troubled young woman NineChristine Jnsson who we first see jumping into the water in a suicide attempt. We see the difficulty of her growing up with parents who are in a bad marriage and the profound impact this has on her life. We see teenage rebellion and feelings of loneliness and depression. We see female sexuality for enjoyment and as a way of escaping reality but then facing the double standard in society. And we see a black market abortion with the film showing both the hypocrisy and the unfairness of these not being legal in Sweden in 1948 except for sociomedicinal grounds like the eugenic case it refers to. All of these things and some cool working class scenes on the docks and in a factory give the film a dark sense of realism.The performance from Jnsson is excellent and the role and her portrayal reminded me of Harriet Andersson from some of Bergman's films in the 1950's. She plays vulnerable defiant loving and lonely all very well and comes across as a feminist hero to me. Early on we see her deftly fend off the supervisor's creepy suggestions for a little payback after he's put in a good word for her and she puts up with several crude things like that over the course of the film. We can see the potential and goodness in her character but at the same time she has to wear her reform school past like a scarlet letter and has difficulties coping in a world that judges instead of empathizes with her. She has seen enough of the world and of men even at her young age to doubt her lover Bengt Eklund will stick around and the scene the two have in the hotel room interrupted by her friend Mimi Nelson is one of the film's best. The scene where she exchange slaps with her mother Berta Hall is also a good one.The film's frank references to premarital sex abortion and a brief bit of nudity were all things American films would not touch for years and just as important are its questioning of authority and social conventions. The film was only released in the UK after 10 years with an X rating and only released in America in 1963 after Bergman had won 2 Oscars. There are some moments when the young director should have exercised restraint such as when Jnsson writes 'lonely' on the mirror in lipstick or when Eklund rages in an overwrought way in the company of a prostitute but all in all he's in fine form here. This is a good meaty film on its own and it's even more interesting because of where it stands in his oeuvre. Well worth seeing and deserves a higher average rating.".

	schema:headline " On the Swedish Waterfront... an Early Bergman film and a little gem of Sweden's NeoRealism...";
	schema:reviewBody "For viewers born decades after the end of the second worldwide conflict it's hard to imagine anything but joy and optimism in the hearts of the younger population that went through what was probably the hardest and certainly darkest part of their lives. We've all basked in stories real and fictional that knighted those who fathered the babyboomers with the title of the greatest generation one whose youth was sacrificed at history's altar ... but that's overlooking their ordinariness how modest their aims were and thus how poignantly relatable their lives could be outside the epic scope of war and other lifeanddeath situations.When Ingmar Bergman Port of Call starts war is way over and there's no any indication of lifethreatening situations yet the film opens with a startling suicide attempt a girl takes a big dive from a dock and many people come to rescue her including a war veteran who just settled in the port town. From what it looks like the two protagonists didn't benefit from the kind of existential canvases that invite for optimism the man is a sailor back from war disillusioned and hiding his easygoing nature behind a mask of cynicism his name is Gsta Bengt Eklund the woman is a young factory girl depressed and insecure with the kind of troubled past that makes any romance doomed from the start and whose roots are to be found within a tense relationship with her overbearing mother. She's Berit NineChrstine Jnsson.Those were the neorealism days in Europe and the noir era in the U.S.A the film maybe unconsciously driven by these two influences doesn't intend to paint a glamorous romance of any kind but rather a life capsule in a small seaside workingclass town a sort of Swedish On the Waterfront where we follow the lives of two loners as they converged one night at a dance. It's an immediate and mutual appreciation that never feels forced nor contrived it IS believable that the two would find oasis of serenity within each other. To use fitting metaphors Gsta has nothing but dreams of stability he's a boat that wants to set ashore someplace drop the anchor once and for all he just doesn't have a compass Berit on the other hand is a raft drifting in the ocean of her own guiltridden past and has no rows whatsoever to move on.In a way the film is more about Berit's attempt to come to term with that past of hers it's not much a character study but a psychological journey into a mindset that made happiness as improbable as the sight of land for a boat without any guidance. Gsta is an active and passive observer who acts as a lookout sometimes and some others becomes a true rower on Berit's frail embarkation. He knows she's as tormented as he is he doesn't care much about her past though he's clearly displeased by the constant harassment she gets from men raising suspicions of the ugliest sorts. So as the film moves on and their relationship thickens more obstacles come across their journey to the promised harbor divulgated through flashbacks revealed secrets and a subplot involving Berit's friend Gertrud Bibi Nelson.The flashbacks on Berit's life are depressing and bleak marital fights scandals life in reformatory school that borders on prostitution and debauchery a difficult motheranddaughter relationship it's a cocktail of lurid negativity that darkens an already heavyloaded movie and the irony is that the friend Gertrud got an even worse deal. The contrast between Berit and Gertrud is interesting on two levels it highlights the fact that Berit is abler to fight her own demons and maybe her real tragedy is that she can't handle happiness even when served on a silver platter as if it was a dish best served cold. The second level is that the film is a powerful social commentary on the tormented lives of women with a 'bad rep' in a system that often pose as a judge of morality driving them to the most extreme and sometimes macabre corners.Bergman in one of his breakthrough movies displays the kind of sensitivities that made he glorious days of European neorealism his Port of Call is as powerful and introspective as the Italian classics of the late 1940s through this portrayal of two lost souls who come to find a true meaning to their lives after many years of unhappiness and resentment. For that the director shows a predisposition for lengthy intimate scenes where two faces are close to each other and one speak alone without looking at the other as if the act of talking was individual and solitary in essence. But when Berit confesses her past to Gsta it looks like she's talking to us from either point of view ours or Gsta's you can feel the emergence of a cinematic talent and a unique ability to paint human emotions with consideration to the viewers.The film is rather simple but it's made in such a way we feel like belonging to the screen... and that's Bergman's power every once in a while Port of Call ceases to be that gripping drama and reaches an unexpected summit of filmmaking showing the early signs of the genius small moments where souls are confronted one to another talking deciding and acting. The tension is real and makes the few moments of relief only more rewarding. And that's an adjective I'd use to describe the ending one that such a movie called for after so many questioning about life it was only fair that the two young protagonists directed under a thenyoung director could find one reason to two to see the future in brighter colors almost spoiled by the poster.".

He's tired of the life and settles into the life of a dockworker. Very soon after he meets a young lady Berit at a dance hall and they sleep together that same night. Berit worries that it's just a one night stand but Gsta does return later. However Berit also worries that he won't stick around when he learns her pastshe's been to reform school and is a mess. When she finally tells him he doesn't know what to do. To make it worse soon she brings a dying friend to his apartmentand she's sure there's no way he'll stick around now. Is there any hope for this couple? Aside from premarital sex the film also deals with family dysfunction and a botched illegal abortionall in a very nonjudgmental manner. I am pretty sure it caused a bit of a stir in its day. I admired it because in just about every way the film tried very hard to deal with reality and avoid clichs. And to avoid clichs the film ends with many many questions unansweredjust like in real life. It was all handled so well that I can't help but admire the film and feel it's actually a lot better than much of Ingmar Bergman's later more celebrated work as it's simpler and less focused on depression like many of his 1960s70s films.

	schema:reviewBody "While none of Ingmar Bergman's late1940s films are among his best work and more indicative of him still finding his footing they are still very interesting and worth seeing. They didn't have quite the same amount of emotional depth complexity and quality of production values and acting those aspects were still very good they were just even better later of his work from the early50s onwards. Yet they were still well made and intrigued and with each film Bergman's style really grew.'Port of Call' is nowhere near being one of Bergman's masterpieces and was produced in a very early period where he had not yet fully found his groove. Understandable though because it was only his fifth film as director. There are a lot of recommendable things about 'Port of Call' though and one can definitely see Bergman's style visually and thematically emerging. Actually think it is really quite impressive for such an early effort of his and is among one of his best late40s films.Sure the story has a lot of melodrama for my tastes a little overheated and soapy on occasion most of it was harrowing and poignant though which gets in the way at times.Occasionally especially the middle the pace could have been tighter.Having said all of that 'Port of Call' is very well made with some beautifully framed and atmospheric photography done in almost semidocumentary style. Bergman's direction grew more confident with each film during this early period and this is some of his most confident and more distinct directing from the period. It's hauntingly scored and thoughtfully scripted that shows a lot of maturity and surprising frankness. Of the uniformly strong acting the powerful performance of NineChristine Jonsoon stands out.Really admired how it dealt with heavy themes some quite daring to depict on film back then and actually don't think it's tame today and that it didn't trivialise any of them while portraying them sensitively. It is not easy exploring or depicting abortion in a hardhitting way without risking controversy but 'Port of Call' handles it well. The story may have melodramatic moments and is quite ordinary in terms of it not having an awful lot new but it is also moving and suitably bleak. The characters feel real as do their situations.Altogether very well done early Bergman. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "One can see the beginnings of some pretty wonderful cinematography in this early work by Ingmar Bergman. It is a slice of life story about two downandouters who have been dealt a bad hand. The young woman has a sparkle despite growing from an abusive family situation. She is dominated by her mother. She has spent time in a reformatory because her life is intolerable and she turns to a man who kindly takes her in. Because of her age the mother can do what she wants. The sailor is a man who has just arrived at this port of call. His first act upon coming ashore is to rescue the young woman who has decided top end it all by jumping in the harbor. Their paths cross again and it develops into a tenuous relationship. His first act is to get her into bed but over time he realizes that she is all he has. Bergman does a nice job of making these people real. She has all kinds of demons and he has trouble accepting her morose being. She has a right to feel the way she does and he really is an unfeeling cad. If one is willing he can see the framing of scenes the positions of actors and some pretty interesting symbols. It is a claustrophobic film. Outdoor scenes are scenes of freedom even the suicide attempt and indoor the forces of the outside close in. See this as a foundation piece.".

The girl is suicidal and as the movie progresses we understand why she feels that way. The boy is also trying to find his footing in life. Alone and confused he acutely feels the need for a partner but can't commit to the girl since wherever he goes with her there are reminders of her notsoperfect past.

Therefore even though the highlytrained social worker and the mother did everything in their own way to help her what the girl really needed was a kindred spirit someone as broken as she was. The fact that the boy ultimately got over his initial reservations about the girl's past and accepted her was what saved her from ultimate destruction.

	schema:reviewBody "Hamnstad is one of the rare Swedish films focusing on family life.Its uniqueness is due to the fact that it has an eclectic mix of serious themes. These themes include bitter harsh realities like abortionbroken home correctional house etc. Bergman has deftly portrayed the dreary lives of its two lonely protagonists  Gosta and Berit. For this purpose he has chosen a small provincial port town where nothing much happens. This film is a good record of how gloomy the life in Sweden Europe during 1940s was. Bergman has also shown us how all emotional problems are solved if lovers decide to remain true to each other. This is precisely the case of Gosta and Berit.Gosta has always led a hard life. He is a moody soul too. As a sailor he has been out on sea for many years. For this reason he is unable to believe that some girl can enter his life in order to love him.There are doubts in Berit's mind too. As a loner she tries hard to leave her past behind. As a young lass Berit witnessed numerous fights involving her father and mother. This is one of the reasons why there is enormous distance between Berit and her mother. It is during one of these turbulent emotional phases that Berit meets Gosta. Even though Gosta is a tough nut to crack his love for Berit is real. On one occasion Gosta fights some young rascals to prove his intensity of emotional attachment for Berit. Gosta even proves that he is the ideal man for Berit as he solemnly ignores Berit's revelation that in the past she was sent to a correction house. He urges Berit to make an earnest effort to leave her past behind. Berit has no hesitation at all in following this humble piece of advice. It is precisely in this manner that both Berit and Gosta embark on a successful journey to lead a happy joyful life as companions for life. All of Bergman's film have a message to offer to audiences. Through Hamnstad he wishes to tell us all that being alone is a terrible feeling.".

	schema:headline " Port of Call";
	schema:reviewBody "Port of Call 1948 12 out of 4Early Bergman film has a young woman Berit NineChristine Jonsson throwing herself into the ocean in a suicide attempt but being pulled out by a man named Gosta Bengt Eklund. Sometime after the two meet up at a party when they go back to her house for sex which soon leads up to a relationship. The relationship starts off on a bad note as Berit is haunted by her past as well as secrets she doesn't want revealed. This is a very dark and bleak love story from Bergman that hits on a few familiar themes of his later films but for the most part you really can't look at this and say this is one of his better movies. There are certainly some very good touches here and there and the performances are great but I think the movie would have benefited from some editing and a better pacing. A lot of the middle parts of the film seemed to have just been repeating itself and I didn't care for the flashback scenes at all. When Berit starts telling her backstory to Gosta I think strong dialogue would have been a lot better than actually watching the stuff play out. Another thing I didn't care too much for was the ending which really seemed to be taped on from another film. It didn't really match up with anything that came before it and it played out too simply. For a film from 1948 this really hits on some touchy subjects including all the sex an aborition and there's even some brief nudity. I'm sure this movie would have been very shocking when originally released but today it comes off rather tame and even the drama isn't as tight as one would expect from the director. With that said there's still a lot to enjoy here and that includes the terrific performances with Jonsson stealing the show as the troubled youth. She's very believable in her role and her opening shot the look of her eyes is quite priceless and tells us all we need to know before she even says anything or we're told anything. Eklund is also very strong in his role as is Mimi Nelson as the mother. Bergman handles the material quite well even though as I said the pacing could have been a little better.".

	schema:reviewBody "A young man gets off a boat in a harbor. Moments later he witnesses a young woman jump off the harbor into the water in obvious despair. They don't meet but he just watches as someone closer jumps into the water and fishes her out leaving the young woman crying on the pavement.Thus starts Port of Call a movie that touches on a few familiar themes that Bergman would visit in his later movies and for a time gets very closer to be a special gem in his early filmography. Missteps in the film's second half though hamper the film and keep it from being quite good.The two young people meet at a night club some time later and immediately hit it off but we can see that the woman Berit is beset by some emotional problems while the young man Gosta seems perhaps a little too aloof for something like a serious relationship. However they enjoy each other's company work through some early misunderstandings and a confrontation with a handsy foreman Berit works under that leaves Gosta bloody and eventually decide to spend a weekend alone together. They are not married so they pretend the relationship in order to get a room but Berit is confronted by a figure from her past.Berit lived in a very unhappy home growing up. Her parents hated each other but they remained together whenever her father wasn't at sea as a ship's first mate in order to try and give Berit a stable home. That didn't really work and Berit ended up running away to live with a boy she hardly knew. Despite the match being remarkably happy Berit was still underage found and sent to a reform house where she met Gertrude a fellow delinquent. The two developed a common bond if not a particular friendship over their shared experience and Gertrude's presence at the hotel where she works and the couple are staying brings everything back. Berit decides to unload herself to Gosta whom she hopes will be understanding.Gosta can't quite reconcile his feelings for Berit with her past asking her how many men she had been with. Her looseness of a certain variety bothers him. The scene of the reveal is a bit awkward. On the one hand there's a wonderful element of later Bergman as the camera focuses squarely on Berit with Gorsta in the background taking in the information. On the other hand the film goes into a series of flashbacks that don't work that well especially the last one that details the scene where Berit lived with another boy and his parents as the parents kicked her out. The reasons for the action we see are unclear short and involve three characters we've never seen before. The overall confessional would have been more effective with just Berit talking a technique Bergman would later use much more frequently.The scene that touches rather directly on later thematic chords from Bergman involves Gosta telling his female troubles to fellow dockworkers. One of them ends up telling him that no one else cares about the problems and only Gorsta and Birta do. This presages the silent God of Bergman's middle period and the laser focus on relationships and those directly involved in his later period. However the movie gets bogged down with competing ideas that get pushed on in front of another. It's not a complete failure but it's enough of a distraction to take what had been a very promising film into something far more ordinary. Even Gertrude's death after a botched abortion feels a bit more like a distraction instead of something that feeds the central narrative.Still the movie shows Bergman's early promise. Performances are universally good and the visual keys he would later use are strong as he alternates between real locations in Stockholm similar to how he would use Faro later to more stylized sets evoking his later use of sets for certain films like All These Women. It's almost good but not quite.".

This presages the silent God of Bergman's middle period and the laser focus on relationships and those directly involved in his later period. However the movie gets bogged down with competing ideas that get pushed on in front of another. It's not a complete failure but it's enough of a distraction to take what had been a very promising film into something far more ordinary. Even Gertrude's death after a botched abortion feels a bit more like a distraction instead of something that feeds the central narrative.Still the movie shows Bergman's early promise. Performances are universally good and the visual keys he would later use are strong as he alternates between real locations in Stockholm similar to how he would use Faro later to more stylized sets evoking his later use of sets for certain films like All These Women. It's almost good but not quite.";

	schema:reviewBody "This was a highly unlikely but surprisingly effective and enjoyable venture for Italian cinema to undertake at the start of the 1980s the fanciful story of 'The Good Thief' who ended up being crucified next to Jesus Christ on Golgotha Hill. Thenpopular comic Enrico Montesano is ideally cast in the title role of a confidence trickster who roams the streets of Galilee forever in search of the next merchant to sell his defective goods to passing off a black goat  harbinger of bad luck  as white by painting it! a dead dog sold for his silvery skin which jumps back to life upon hearing its master's whistle etc. or the next gullible simpleton to impress with his 'magical' skills changing water into wine via a tube hidden inside his robe attached to his arms etc.. Naturally he does not take kindly to the appearance of Jesus a very understated and virtually silent appearance by regular EuroCult tough guy Claudio Cassinelli who not only seems to impinge on his territory but also seemingly outdoes his every trick with the greatest of ease and the minimum of fuss! Despite its reverent subject being ostensibly an Italian comedy of its time and costarring the bountiful Edwige Fenech playing Lazarus' cousin a hasbeen leper whore! no less one could hardly fail to find nudity herealthough surprisingly enough the film's sexiest episode involves distinguished French actress Bernadette Lafont who as the nymphomaniac wife of a Roman aristocrat indulges in some prolonged posterior playtime with her willing slave Montesano!! Another ingredient that comes with the territory is crude humor of the scatological variety and this is exhibited via Montesano's encounter with a bunch of Roman soldiers who entrapping him in a grave first force him to display his circumcised organ and then to repay the favor douse him in collective peeing!! Incongruously this is then followed by the film's most poignant sequence when the soldiers callously shoot dead his fateful dog that amusingly had previously served as Montesano's 'eye' during card games! Furthermore director Festa Campanile who was also the author of the controversial original source novel cleverly makes his hapless protagonist a witness to Christ's ministry long before their fateful meeting on Good Friday he shares a beggars' banquet at the Cana Wedding he sees a lame man being cured he goes to the Sermon on the Mount when the miracle of the multiplication of the bread and fish to feed the masses is performed he is there to observe His walk on water he is the one to benefit albeit for a shortterm from Christ telling a wealthy acolyte to go dispose of his every earthly possession and follow Him etc. Strangely enough however the allimportant Cruxifiction scene is rather carelessly dealt with as if the filmmakers where impatient to wrap things up! In any case their decision to shoot in Tunisia pays dividends in an authentic recreation of the times and the ubiquitous Ennio Morricone supplies a jaunty music score that pleases the ear without taxing one's memory.".

	schema:reviewBody "Comedian Enrico Montesano stars as Caleb the good thief of the title. Not good in the sense of stealing from the rich and giving to the poor but in that his escapades are funny. A contemporary of Jesus Christ played by Claudio Cassinelli Caleb is convinced that Jesus is a con artist just like him and becomes jealous of his more accomplished 'tricks' and tries to copy them.From start to finish Caleb makes his innerthoughts known by way of narration revealing that the film is based on a novel by Pasquale Festa Campanile. Naturally the view of Christ presented therein caused quite a stir when the book came out. As director however Campanile avoids most of the controversial parts and concentrates on the saucy bits instead.Practically every woman who meets Caleb falls for him even though he often mentions how much he smells during his aforementioned voiceover. The one woman who proves to be his match is Edwidge Fenech as Deborah a hooker cured of leprosy by Christ. Despite of her profession Fenech' nude scenes are kept to a bare minimum though still pictures reveal at least one more scene of Caleb and Deborah in bed that doesn't appear in the film. Apart from Edwige there are many beautiful shots of the landscape filmed in her homeland Tunisia and Ennio Morricone serves up one of his 'comical' scores.However at 110 minutes Il Ladrone rather overstays his welcome. The story is really a collection of mostly comic set pieces. Many subplots and diversions could easily have been left out and the occasionally crude humor does not fit with the more serious parts about Caleb's envy for Christ. For example a sad scene involving the death of Caleb's dog Joshua at the hands of evil Romans is followed up by a very silly bit with him taking revenge by selling an 'invisibility cream' to the killer.7 out of 10".
