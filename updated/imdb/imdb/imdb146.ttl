But in this nice lowbudget for MGM movie made when she was 15 at most there is something of the sweetly awkward colt about her in the title role. There are scenes in which she sort of oscillates between childhood and adulthoodthe visual equivalent of an adolescent's voice crackingand it was in this movie that she got her first screen kiss from an engaging James Lydon. It's a bittersweet movie about the deferrals and compromises that one has to make in lifethe parents who don't continue their higher education the soldier who resumes his the refugee professor. As Cynthia's mother Mary Astor brings her usual warmth and common sense and there are vague echoes of her questing yearning character in Dodsworth. Cynthia's illness is used as something of a metaphor for domestic discontent and in view of Taylor's chronic health problems is a little unsettling in retrospect.".

The motivations of the mother and father as well as the uncle as the doctor and his family are the engine that drive the plot. However the directors job once he has a decent story is to elicit emotion of varying kinds from the audience. If you want to look at and watch Liz Taylor in all her youthful glory and magnetism this is one of the best. Ironically if forebodes her complete life as a great actress who has health problems all her life. This film took me up and down several times much to my amazement and has a great Hollywood happy wrap up. nothing wrong with feeling good especially at 6 A M. Yes of course there are some problems but I watch films for the way they make me feel in the end not specifically to be a critic especially films of this genre and contrived time period. I loved it because it made me feel alive and real!!We all have felt these same emotions in our youth and this well done film allows us feel these once more.".

Watch Cynthia anyway. It's a delightful gem from Elizabeth Taylor's younger days even earlier than Little Women! And speaking of Little Women Mary Astor plays Liz's mother in this film as well. George Murphy plays her father and S.Z. Sakall rounds out the cast as the school's lovable theater director.At the start of the film Mary and George are shown young and in love and their adorable romance quickly blossoms into marriage. They have grand plans to live in Vienna and study music and medicine but when Mary gets pregnant their plans go on hold temporarily. Fifteen years later they're stuck in the same small town renting a house they can't afford struggling to pay their daughter's outrageous doctor's bills on a oneincome salary from George's work in a hardware store. The parents' part of the film is actually quite sad as you feel their disappointment as well as their guilt whenever they resent their lost dreams. Both George and Mary give wonderful performances.Because George and Mary are so threedimensional it's difficult to call Liz the gem of the film but she really is. She's so delightful innocent charming passionate and frail culminating in such a captivating performance it's absolutely impossible not to love her. And since it's so impossible not to love her you understand why George bows and scrapes to his boss as well as his brotherinlaw the greedy Gene Lockhart who treats Liz during her countless illnesses. You understand every part of Mary's behavior as she embodies every mother's journey in raising a teenaged daughter. In one scene Liz comes home from her first date. Mary wants to revel in her daughter's happiness but she also tries to instill responsibility like taking better care of her dress or soaking in a hot bath so she won't catch cold.Every part of this movie is a joy to watch from the cute to the tragic. You'll reach for your handkerchief from time to time and if you watch this with your kids or parents you'll cry even more. Everyone gives strong performances and I'm sure you'll find your favorite moments as I have. At the heart of it all is Elizabeth Taylor so beautiful and yet so innocent and fresh even though it's impossible she ever felt what her character went through in real life. How could the gorgeous Elizabeth Taylor know what it felt like to be ignored by all the boys in school and then the thrilling joy at being allowed to go to her first dance? It's called acting and she does it beautifully.".

	schema:headline " Something offbeat";
	schema:reviewBody "SLIGHT SPOILERS Teenaged Elizabeth Taylor stars as a sickly girl who just wants to live a normal high school life. Her parents and her uncle who is her doctor are obsessively overprotective. It is stated early in the film You've never had any illness that most children don't get but it is more severe with you. Is it? There is something a little dark in this portrayal of small town life. It is a milder MGM version of Kings Row. Is Cynthia's uncledoctor so jealous that she is brighter and more beautiful than his own daughter that he will concoct fake illnesses for his niece? Are Cynthia's underachieving parents so insecure that they will listen to their obviously psycho brotherinlaw? There also seems to be that too young to be pregnant theme concerning the marriage of Cynthia's parents. This is ridiculous they were adults who got married and settled. It's not about the taking away of dreams! Is Cynthia's birth to blame for her parents' failures? I should say not! They wanted to study medicine and music in Vienna. Nowhere is it mentioned that this would have been impossible anyway with the rise of one Adolf Hitler! What about the music teacher Mr. Rosencrantz? He longs for Vienna. Why? If he was still in Vienna the Nazis would have put him in the gas chamber! None of this is mentioned at all. There is a nice touch in characterization which shows Cynthia's mother willing to change and let her daughter grow up while Cynthia's father is completely under the control of his sister and brotherinlaw. Still Cynthia's mother has a very difficult time letting go. The ironic humor of the piece has Cynthia falling for an older boy who has a reputation of being somewhat wild he turns out to be as overprotective as her parents!Pop Leonard's direction lacks humor and the film can get a little heavy. There is one slapstick sequence featuring former Our Gang star Scotty Beckett. George Murphy and Mary Astor are very sympathetic as the parents and Gene Lockhart is an excellent villain. S. Z. Sakall as the AustrianJewish music teacher is as welcome as always. Jimmy Lydon is quite good in his role as Liz's boyfriend there is no trace of Henry Aldrich here! This is a rare chance to see Liz Taylor as an innocent and sweet girl. She pulls it off like an older version of Margaret O'Brien. You just have to root for her and love her. But who is that doing Liz's singing? Is it Liz? Sometimes it sounds like her voice while other times it sounds like Jane Powell. Was there some kind of mix and match voice thing going on?".

Her parents and her uncle who is her doctor are obsessively overprotective. It is stated early in the film You've never had any illness that most children don't get but it is more severe with you. Is it? There is something a little dark in this portrayal of small town life. It is a milder MGM version of Kings Row. Is Cynthia's uncledoctor so jealous that she is brighter and more beautiful than his own daughter that he will concoct fake illnesses for his niece? Are Cynthia's underachieving parents so insecure that they will listen to their obviously psycho brotherinlaw? There also seems to be that too young to be pregnant theme concerning the marriage of Cynthia's parents. This is ridiculous they were adults who got married and settled. It's not about the taking away of dreams! Is Cynthia's birth to blame for her parents' failures? I should say not! They wanted to study medicine and music in Vienna. Nowhere is it mentioned that this would have been impossible anyway with the rise of one Adolf Hitler! What about the music teacher Mr. Rosencrantz? He longs for Vienna. Why? If he was still in Vienna the Nazis would have put him in the gas chamber! None of this is mentioned at all. There is a nice touch in characterization which shows Cynthia's mother willing to change and let her daughter grow up while Cynthia's father is completely under the control of his sister and brotherinlaw. Still Cynthia's mother has a very difficult time letting go. The ironic humor of the piece has Cynthia falling for an older boy who has a reputation of being somewhat wild he turns out to be as overprotective as her parents!Pop Leonard's direction lacks humor and the film can get a little heavy. There is one slapstick sequence featuring former Our Gang star Scotty Beckett. George Murphy and Mary Astor are very sympathetic as the parents and Gene Lockhart is an excellent villain. S. Z. Sakall as the AustrianJewish music teacher is as welcome as always. Jimmy Lydon is quite good in his role as Liz's boyfriend there is no trace of Henry Aldrich here! This is a rare chance to see Liz Taylor as an innocent and sweet girl. She pulls it off like an older version of Margaret O'Brien. You just have to root for her and love her. But who is that doing Liz's singing? Is it Liz? Sometimes it sounds like her voice while other times it sounds like Jane Powell. Was there some kind of mix and match voice thing going on?";

	schema:reviewBody "Elizabeth Taylor in the title role plays an overprotected 15yearold who has lengthy bouts of illnesses seemingly due to a compromised immune system. She yearns to do normal teenage activities but keeps having these setbacks related to her illness that constantly worry her parents played by George Murphy and Mary Astor and her doctor uncle played by Gene Lockhart. Their strategy to prevent the illnesses from happening is to isolate her from her friends at school have her come straight home and forbid her from participating in school activities. Of course Cynthia is not going to be a wallflower forever because this is a young Elizabeth Taylor here and the one thing she does not suffer from even at 15 is awkward teenager syndrome compared to most. Noticing this right away is Ricky Latham played by Jimmy Lydon who was not the Zac Efron of the 40's but somehow managed to play Taylor's love interest in Life with Father as well who looks past the sicknesses and sees a beautiful smart charismatic young girl that just needs to get out of the house. Noticing this as well with jealousy is her cousin Fredonia played by Carol Brannan who has eyes on Ricky also despite the fact she has a boyfriend of her own. Eventually Cynthia's mother realizes that babying her will never teach her to overcome her problems and hatches a plan with her daughter to get her to the Prom without Dad and Uncle knowing. Elizabeth Taylor shows her acting is beyond the capabilities of most other teenage actors of her day but still displays the girlish charm of someone coming into her own. The movie has a fair amount of fretting and whining but it does come out of it with some fine comedic scenes throughout the film and underrated performances from the supporting cast.".

	schema:reviewBody "At the height of her film career Elizabeth Taylor was one of the most famous women in the world and even after she retired from acting she remained famous largely because of her notoriously complex lovelife. And yet there are a surprisingly large number of films on her CV which today are virtually forgotten and which even when first released probably did not arouse a great deal of interest. Cynthia dating from 1947 when Taylor was only fifteen is a case in point. Cynthia Bishop is a beautiful teenage high school girl from the small town of Napoleon Illinois. Most of the plot revolves around the point that Cynthia is supposedly physically frail and suffers from health problems and is therefore not allowed to do many of the things that teenage girls normally do such as attending the school prom. There is also a subplot dealing with the frustrated dreams of her parents Larry and Louise both of whom once dreamed of going to Vienna Larry to study medicine and Louise to study music. They never however realised these ambitions and today Larry is a badlypaid assistant in a hardware store and Louise a housewife. The film was based on a play called The Rich Full Life and although I have never seen it indeed I had never previously heard of it or of its author one Via Delmar that title seems to sum up the general theme. The idea is that one can still live a rich full life even if one is an invalid or if one's youthful ambitions have been thwarted. The screenplay however does not fully realise the potential of either of the two plotlines and too much is left unclear. We are never told exactly why Louise and Larry were unable to study in Vienna the implication is that Louise accidentally became pregnant out of wedlock and that theirs was a shotgun marriage but in the moral climate of the forties with the Production Code still in full force this could not be made explicit. There is no acknowledgement of the fact that the Vienna of the 1930s torn by political strife between Nazis Communists Socialists and Austrofascists might not have been the most congenial place in which to study nor of the fact that there are perfectly good medical schools and colleges of music in America itself the Vienna of this film is simply a romantic symbol of youthful illusions not a reallife city. Cynthia is the title character and most of the action revolves around her but the healthylooking Taylor never makes a convincing invalid. It is never made clear exactly what illnesses Cynthia suffers from beyond the fact that she tends to catch cold easily Taylor spends a lot of the film sneezing or whether her status as an invalid is genuine. It is strongly hinted that she may in fact be the victim of obsessive concern on the part of her overprotective parents backed up by the local doctor who also happens to be Cynthia's uncle what one might call hypochondria by proxy. The filmmakers never seem quite clear whether they are making a comedy or a serious family drama. The overall theme is a basically serious one but in many parts especially those scenes dealing with the rivalry between Cynthia and her insufferable cousin Fredonia they are obviously aiming for laughs. Whether they actually achieve them is another matter. Taylor displays both the beauty and the charisma which were later to make her a big adult star but not unfortunately the talent and there are no performances of any particular merit from anyone else in the cast. It is not difficult to understand why Cynthia is today one of the most obscure entries in Taylor's filmography. 410".

She was not the hot house geranium that Murphy and Astor have raised.Lockhart and Byington have a daughter Carol Brannan and Brannan as Liz'scousin thinks of nothing but boys 247. There's one special boy in Jimmy Lydon who lied about his age and went to war. Now he's back in high schooland seen as the catch of the year. Lydon never really rings true as a character. He surely doesn't show any of thematurity that one would have after war service. I can't see how he would fitinto high school. Just get a GED and go claim your GI benefits would be morerealistic. Lydon doesn't seem that much more mature than Scotty Beckett who is Brannan's ever reliable boyfriend and playing awkward as he always didas a teen. Lydon's character is a weakness that the movie Cynthia has.It's biggest strength is Taylor of course. It's really heart warming to see her emerge from the hot house. Also S.Z. Sakall as a sympathetic music teacherwho remembers old Vienna steals every scene he's in as he always does.Cynthia is a film as old as I am. It's also holding up in far better shape than this author. Elizabeth Taylor's legion of fans will still love it.".

He surely doesn't show any of thematurity that one would have after war service. I can't see how he would fitinto high school. Just get a GED and go claim your GI benefits would be morerealistic. Lydon doesn't seem that much more mature than Scotty Beckett who is Brannan's ever reliable boyfriend and playing awkward as he always didas a teen. Lydon's character is a weakness that the movie Cynthia has.It's biggest strength is Taylor of course. It's really heart warming to see her emerge from the hot house. Also S.Z. Sakall as a sympathetic music teacherwho remembers old Vienna steals every scene he's in as he always does.Cynthia is a film as old as I am. It's also holding up in far better shape than this author. Elizabeth Taylor's legion of fans will still love it.";

She was around 15 when it originally hit screens probably 14 when it was made. She has top billing over Hollywood pros George Murphy and Mary Astor who play her parents. S.Z. Sakall is fourthbilled as her music instructor. The story concerns a somewhat awkward and sickly teenage girl whose family smothers her. At times her only bit of happiness is when Sakall is teaching her at the piano. I do think the performances are very good though. Murphy and Astor are believable as stodgy parents who only want the best for their young daughter Gene Lockhart who plays a doctoruncle and Spring Byington as his wife are appropriately fussy and interfering and Sakall comes in at key moments to brighten things up in case it all gets too maudlin.".

The rest of the cast including Mary Astor S.Z.

Perhaps it was simply a product of the early cold war period? Conformity and settling for second best are celebrated and the only message seems to be that it's OK to be average and ordinary and to sacrifice the dreams of youth as long as you're married own your own home and hold down a job you hate.Perhaps the most stomach churning scene occurs near the film's conclusion when Cynthia's mentor the Viennese music professor played by S.Z. Sakall tells her parents that in essence they are wrong to have hankered to leave their hometown and that everything here in Napoleon including the coffee mind you is better than it was in his native city. I don't know which godforsaken outer suburb of Vienna he'd been living in  but if he really believes this Midwestern hell hole in any way rivals one of the world's richest cultural capitals I'd say he should have stayed in Vienna and presented himself to Sigmund Freud for emergency analysis.As for poor Cynthia  she shows promise at the story's beginning  she reads and enjoys Shakespeare she sings she has spirit. She doesn't appear to fully embrace the 'school spirit' that renders her schoolmates into unpleasant robotic unquestioning and schoolsong singing yahoos.

	schema:reviewBody "'Jack the Bear' is drama set in the Seventies revolving around Leary family and their first summer since the loss of their wife and mother. John hosts a latenight horror show and while he has an understanding of television he struggles to be a proper father to his sons thirteenyearold Jack and fouryearold Dylan. Instead Jack is left to be a substitute parent to his young brother while not only going through adolescence but is also struggling with the recent loss of his mother.This film is a much darker version of the subjects brought up in 'My Girl' with the lead here being a boy instead of a girl. It was quite interesting to see a boy instead of a girl who is usually cast in such movies cope with the loss and guilt over his mother's death shouldering the responsibility of caring for his little brother and alcoholic father and learning the lessons of his first love.One of the main themes of the film is comingofage both for Jack and his father. John is relearning how to be a parent without his partner by his side and redefining his relationship with his boys. As for Jack as a boy of thirteen he is starting to see life through an adult's eyes as he lets go of childhood innocence. One of the harshest lessons of the adultworld he learns is that not all monsters are ugly things who live in the closet and humans can be evil too when his younger brother kidnapped by a Nazi neighbour who harbours a grudge against his father and a young lad in his neighbourhood develops some Nazi traits when he turns to the wrong person for a role model.This films is really enjoyable both with cute moments Jack's little brother is adorable and darker angstier times. Definitely worth a look.".

	schema:headline " Growing up is never easy";
	schema:reviewBody "Jack the Bear is a wonderful movie. It is the story of John Leary Danny DeVito and his two boys Jack Robert J. Steinmiller Jr. and Dylan young Miko Hughes known e.g. from his later accomplishment in 'Mercury Rising'. It is a story that takes a bittersweet look at the joys and pains of growing up. By doing so it elaborates on weighty issues while at the same it has a certain amount of humor to it. Yet despite the subtle comedian edge this movie is by no means a comedy. It is a very emotional and instructive tale of one family's struggles of challenges and tragedies. It features sincere messages of life and can be seen as a symbolic story that stands for the premise that growing up is never easy. Sometimes it is painful. Sometimes it is scaring. Then again when the chips are low and the world seems to fall apart there is hope. Hope you find within your family hope  and the knowledge that there will be brighter days ahead.Danny DeVito plays Jack Leary a widower who works as a monsterhost of a late night horror show and who entertains the neighborhood kids with silly ghoulish antics. His twelveyearold son Jack is the movie's main protagonist. He talks to the audience as if he would tell the story of his life  which he does to some extent. The entire developments are told through his eyes mainly. Thus the story is endowed with the childish naivety that makes it so special and so sincere. Dylan Jack's little brother is about four years old. The setting is Oakland California in 1972.The main theme that runs through the entire story is the theme of monsters. Jack Leary the perfect monster in his TV show is not the only one. Right at the beginning Jack says that he would find out that summer that real monsters existed. Then there is Jack's monster crush on the lovely girl at school young Reece Witherspoon which is a subtheme of the plot. We share Jack's joy and his confusion after their first date which is so funny as many will be able to identify with his tenseness prior to and his enthusiasm after their first kiss. The real monster is introduced as weird and apparently dangerous Norman Strick Gary Sinise who completes the quality of the cast who turns out to be a deceitful and dangerous antagonist.The strongest emotional theme is that of family life. John's wife Jack's and Dylan's mom died the previous winter in a road accident after some heavy arguments with her husband. This left a huge gap in the boys' lives and painful scars on Jack in particular. He occasionally seems to see her and we get some flashbacks to their time together throughout the movie. This is very tough and intensifies the feeling of loss and loneliness. This theme is then even more so addressed when Dylan is kidnapped which is presented in all its horror and pain for Jack and his dad. Very close to this is John's struggle to be a good father to overcome his irresponsibility and live up the needs of his boys. All of these aspects mixed together make up the story's strength and provide substantially more than mere entertainment but real issues of daily struggles and common problems.Seen from sociocultural aspects this movie is typically American in its entire setting and its developments. Following the emotionally stirring showdown with Norman Strick Jack has an emotional breakdown and cries for his mother. When John tries to comfort him Jack shouts No nothing is all right! Then John looks straight into his son's eyes and replies Then we gonna make it all right. This is the embodiment of the American Dream the American attitude never to give up and keep fighting even if the chips are low and the times are hard and full of privation.The cast is outstanding the acting is very convincing and the themes are brilliantly worked out. It is the struggle of a father to keep his kids it is one boy's quest to find happiness it is a typically American tale of courage and steadfastness of values trust and love. The movie captures pure messages of life is exciting and displays tremendous wisdom all woven together in the cultural stratum of 1972. And finally it has genuine humor and provides first class entertainment for the entire family. You will enjoy Jack the Bear and you have all reason to do so.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most people are surprised when they find out about this film. The only one to blame for this is the studio because the trailer synopsis and the poster don't do it justice.When it was released most people probably thought it was a kids movie so they skipped it. In fact this is a kid's movie for adults genre that had it's glory days from the second half of the 80ies with the all boys Stand by Me to the second half of the 90ies with the all girls Now and Then. These movies usually a grownup character's reminiscence of childhood days are about kids but their tribulations although not always probable are with the real world. This ain't no Goonies but it isn't Dolores Claiborne either. These films were meant for us the kids that grew up and now can laugh with a certain nostalgic feel about the adventurous moments of childhood.Here Danny has a very interesting main supporting role as a caring and sacrificing if flawed father of two boys during the day and a host of a macabre kids show during the night. As it's predecessors this movie also does some things right and some things wrong. It has many good and serious elements and yet it is really sweet all the way through. This sweetness is created by great direction that menages to capture a nostalgic vibe especially through 60ies classic rock soundtrack special camera lance shading like we're watching something from the past and a sense of actual neighborhood and family community a street where Danny and the kids live. Just in the look department this film mostly resembles the look of 1993's film Matinee with John Goodman. The past we see here may be real or yet just a way we want to remember it but it does feel real enough and that helps in our occasional suspension of disbelief for the plot. On the other hand this film is occasionally very melodramatic often predictable way way too much obvious foreshadowing and sometimes not sure what it is a serious drama or adventurous film. They could say they were going with recreating the real life which is often a comedy and a tragedy feeling with that one. Kids do a great job especially the kid brother and actors do make a wonderful again if melodramatic sense of family unity against all odds.Long story short this is a movie of Stand By Me kind and if you like the latter or Danny do watch this one.They are not kids movies but they are not real dramas either. They are the past that we can identify with because we feel it could or should have been our own.".

	schema:headline " A Different Kind of Horror Film";
	schema:reviewBody "The Leary family John Danny DeVito Jack Robert J. Steinmiller Jr. and Dylan Miko Hughes have moved from Syracuse New York to Oakland California in the early 1970s. John was a children's show host in Syracuse but also has a love for horror films and becomes a television horror film host in Oakland. On one level the film is just a drama about the Leary's trying to settle into their new life. On another level Jack The Bear is about confronting various kinds of monsters from makebelieve to human as well as more abstract monsters including behaviors that are difficult to control and accidental tragedies such as deaths.I've seen Jack The Bear a few times now and every time I see it I like it even better. The performances are fantastic taking you on a roller coaster of emotions. But it almost requires multiple viewings to really get the film. At its heart is the growing presence and threat of the various monsters mentioned above. The various monsters are all woven together in very complex ways and most of the developments later on in the film are about how those monsters can be conquered but always at some price. Just as the threads are densely combined so is the vanquishing of the monsters and both the development of the monsters and the solutions to them are like various pieces of a large jigsaw puzzle each piece necessary for the whole and often affecting the whole in unexpected ways.The direction script editing cinematography and all of the technical aspects are impeccable. The score is also wonderful and not only enhances the setting but underscores the dramatic developments if you listen to the lyrics closely.A 10 out of 10 from me. Don't miss this film.".

Most of all he faces the loss of his mother and deals with it the only way he can by crying. None of these themes are new in a coming of age movie but the emotions Jack goes through seem multiplied by 100 when compared to similar films. When he feels guilt I was shocked by its intensity. And when he feels angry I felt uneasy at the degree of rage shown by a basically mild mannered preteen.The film is also not afraid to show its characters acting unpredictably. I came to care about them and was sometimes shocked by their behavior. But although disturbing it was always realistic. All in all I thought the film offered a bold example of how a family copes with big problems. I'd say that it's too intense for small children but unfortunately adults may be put off by the storyline and the age of the main character. However I'd recommend it to teens and adults who might have forgotten how rough adolescence can be.".

I have a few of those movies...when I saw that Jack The Bear was coming out on DVD I ordered a copy right away. I hadn't seen this movie since 9395. I remember it being very powerful even got my older brother in tears. Although I wasn't sure how I would find it now 1011 years later. I must say it's truly a very powerful drama. It's very very touching never seen De Vito this good the kids Senise etc  Everyoneeverything is great. It's a very heartwarming story and it feels very real. It's truly a classic movie and I must say I even appreciate it more now that I've grown up 26 years old.Still  One of my favorite movies.www.sannelli.com".

I remember it being very powerful even got my older brother in tears. Although I wasn't sure how I would find it now 1011 years later. I must say it's truly a very powerful drama. It's very very touching never seen De Vito this good the kids Senise etc  Everyoneeverything is great. It's a very heartwarming story and it feels very real. It's truly a classic movie and I must say I even appreciate it more now that I've grown up 26 years old.Still  One of my favorite movies.www.sannelli.com";

Devito does a good job in delivering his character earnestly and his comic genius is well employed through his character's job as a movie host. Gary Senise does his usual fine job and the young actors are all excellent. The flashbacks of the mother are done tastefully and though a dark film it is entertaining and enjoyable. The scenes of the neighborhood kids interacting are accurate and the dialogue very natural and real. The attitudes of that era are captured quite accurately as well. I recommend this film highly.".

It's a lowkey film with warm camera work that isn't afraid of shots that linger on the actors letting their expressions speak rather than filling the space with words.

	schema:headline " Very touching";
	schema:reviewBody "Jack the Bear is a touching underrated piece of cinema with fine performances allaround.  Danny DeVito gives one of his best performances combining his knack for comedy with his knack for serious drama.  His character rings very true to life.  Many people who seem extremely happy and always crack jokes are actually hiding tons of emotion baggage.  Just look at most comedians.  How many of them live clean happy lives?  DeVito's character John knew how to make people laugh and smile but the only one who could see what's hiding behind his smile is his eldest son Jack.  I know people like John who are almost always cheerful but later on I found out they're really crying on the inside.  DeVito steals the show like he usually does but the rest of the cast is superb as well.  The boy who plays the son is quite good though his emotional outbursts are sometimes hammy.  Miko Hughes who was terrific in Mercury Rising with Bruce Willis delivers a wonderful performance even though he hardly says a word throughout the film.  His facial expressions and body language especially considering how young he was is impressive enough.  Reese Witherspoon shows that she was just as cute and charming back then as she is now everyone should check out her very first film Man in the Moon.  Gary Sinise gives one of his most creepy powerful performances as a racist Nazi loner who threatens the children in the neighborhood.  The scenes with him are extremely compelling almost heartstopping. This is a fascinating uplifting story that's only sometimes manipulative. I was very touched and some scenes even brought me to tears.  John is the type of character you feel much sympathy for despite the fact that he's an alcoholic and tends to cause a scene.  You feel even more sorry for him because of that.  We don't want to see his life go through this downward spiral.  Yet nobody's perfect.  We all have our fatal flaws. My score  8 out of 10".

Add the kidsounding movie title  Jack The Bear and the film description family fare that critic describe it as on the front and back cover and I naturally assumed this was safe material. What I forgot to check was the rating. Had I seen PG13 I would have been warned. No this isn't Texas Chainsaw Massacre but it's certainly not some teddy bear sweet family movie either.Jack The Bear has its good and bad moments it's good family scenes but also its profanity and down time. In the end it tries to do too many things at once. In that process the last quarter of the movie gets out of control and ruins the positive effect one might have had through the first three quarters. It's like having your football team play a good first three quarters be leading the game and appearing all set for a victory and then falling apart and blowing it in the last quarter.The Nazi bit with weird neighbor Norman Gary Sinise seemed unnecessary and made this otherwise warmbutalsosad single parent story disjointed. I usually like mixing categories if you will like adding comedy to drama but this was a film that didn't seem sure what it wanted to be and suffered for it. Still it wasn't boring but just don't watch it with your little kids.".

While the distant shadow of tragedy still hangs over Jack the Bear it's a background element. We see Jack take care of his little brother experience his first day in a new school develop a crush on a girl and invite her to his house for dinner and stay up late at night to watch a horrormovie show that his father stars in. The film moves along at a leisurely pace letting us float in nostalgia as we remember what it's like to be a child.However about the time that Gary Sinese's Norman starts playing a major role the film shifts from light drama to leaden melodrama with doses of action and silliness thrown in for good measure. The second half of Jack the Bear is a jerky uneven ride that never comes close to fulfilling the promise of what preceded it.".

This was the part I simply could not make sense of. I spent most of the latter part of the film trying to determine if Gary Sinise was actually dangerous or just kind of an oddball but harmless. It was unclear to me whether he had actually harmed the young boy who he apparently kidnapped or if he really was intending to kill the other boy at the end. I simply could not get a handle on this character what motivated him why he was the way he was was he mentally ill a childhater a neofascist ? What was the significance of the kid wearing a Nazi uniform for Halloween? I kept wondering if the character would turn out to be a comic villain. I just found the character so underwritten that he was completely unfathomable. I never got any real sense of why he was supposed to be so evil and why any of the neighbors would have tolerated his presence around children if they knew how deranged he was. The film is well acted and quite powerful but it just doesn't work for me. The psycho neighbor throws the whole regular family drama out of kilter and takes the movie down such a strange path that the movie gets derailed.".

It is very easy to lump the four girls together into one entity as the Eyes on the Prize documentary did but Spike Lee was able to set them apart as individuals and shows the grief felt by the friends and relatives to this day. However the documentary seems to tell only about twothirds of the story. Some of the nittygritty details about the bombing and the investigation are quickly summarized in order to bring the film to a quick conclusion. If I didn't know from other sources I would not have known for example the nature of the bomb  was it set by a timer? Thrown into the church? I know from news accounts that it was the latter but you would not have known if you were uninitiated and just learning through this documentary. There are also questions that come to mind that Lee leaves unanswered What was the reaction of the white community in the area I know for example that the bombing was certainly not unanimously cheered by the white south? How was the bombing investigated? What eventually led the investigators to the guilty parties? The story of the 15 year search for the bomber and his accomplices in fact the search went on longer than that even into the year 2001 is an important part of the story. A film as powerful as this should have taken the time to go into every nook and cranny of the story. Yes it was excellent. Yes it should have won the Documentary award for that year. Yes it brought a tear to my eye. But there could have been so much more and could have made the story that much more powerful.".

This documentary opened showed this viewpoint.It brought tears to my eyes to listen and see the relatives of those four girls who were killed.  Unless you have a blind eye a deaf ear and a harda heart it is impossible to not be moved when you see these girls' sisters and mothers describe that Sunday morning when Addie Denise Maxine and Carole were killed.  I could see the hurt in the mothers' eyes and hear pain in their voices when talking about their babies. I highly recommend watching this documentary.  Spike Lee did an outstanding job.".

It was a crime that shook the nation and the world. Its still in the news! There was a man who only recently was convicted for his role in it. Spike Lee does an amazing job in bringing this tragedy back to us. In interviews with the families of these girls and various others. The one that got me is the one with George Wallace. I thought it was really pathetic the way he kept bringing his butler into the picture and saying that he had a black friend. If anyone symbolized the bigotry and violence in the South during this period its Wallace and I think to show him in this was wrong. By the way the song at the opening when they show these poor little girl's graves will haunt you for a long time.".

Whether it be the parents friends or people who lived in the community all of their stories were compelling needed to be heard.One of the most memorable scenes for me was the scene with former Governor of Alabama George Wallace. I'm amazed that Lee was able to get him to make an appearance. Even after thirtyfive years the viewer can see that Wallace still didn't get it. In one scene he introduces an AfricanAmerican friend of his saying he doesn't go anywhere without him. When his friend comes on camera however you can see that he is very uncomfortable about being seen with Wallace.At the end of the film there is a little discussion about the events being a part of God's plan. As the participants are deeply religious people they give their views but no one is really sure. Yet one of the mother's goes on to say that she had to put all of the pain and sadness behind her. She was able to look back and say that although this horrible thing was a part of her life she still had so many other blessings to be thankful for.

It is disgusting to see the look of arrogance of one of the perpetrators of this heinous crime when he is brought to justice in the midseventies. It was also interesting to see how George Wallace shapeshifted to maintain political power  there is apt parable in the documentary about fire and milk horses on this ability. In some ways George Wallace reminds me of how some of the Nazis after World War II never came to acknowledge their guilt and complicity. But then again as the good people in this film bravely point out  hate never accomplishes anything good.I was also happy that Taylor Branch was interviewed as he wrote 3 monumental books on the civil rights movement.".

I think his best work within this feature aside from securing the trust of the kin of the 4 girls murdered which is tough in itself was the interview with George Wallace. It took me a second to believe that that was actually him and that he agreed to the interview. The features on the disc I watched gave the full interview and you realized that this man was near the end of his life and quite ill and probably trying to save some face for his earlier actions. It was both tough and fascinating to watch the former governor make excuses for his earlier actions and doing so by talking about what he did for black students while he was governor. He frequently called over his black friend to be in the camera shot with him. You find out later that the same man who has traveled all over the world with the governor is also working for him as his nurse. Plus the same person gave no indication spoken or unspoken of his friendship with the governor. He simply looked nervous not someone who looked in full support of the governor's friendship.I highly recommend this documentary and accompanying making of. I look forward to your comments.".

	schema:headline " A Spike Lee Joint";
	schema:reviewBody "On September 15th 1963 Robert Chambliss murdered four innocent children at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham Alabama. The tragic event resulted in earth shaking ramifications witnessed throughout the country. Millions of people previously unaware of or indifferent to the racial crisis existing within the South were suddenly forced to take issue with a righteous cause that refused to vanish conveniently. The murderer commonly known as 'Dynamite Bob' had hoped to reinforce previously existing segregation laws by committing a desperate act of terrorism against a most sacred and beloved institution. Much to his surprise these violent tendencies only strengthened the Birmingham community in their quest for equitable treatment for all Black citizens. However it should not be forgotten that such a cowardly act caused indescribable grief and unbearable pain for the families of the victims. While the death of these four little girls was undoubtedly a crucial turning point in the civil rights movement it was also a crushing blow dealt to four harmless unsuspecting families. Spike Lee's debut documentary is a film that is engulfed with anger pain and disappointment. At the same time however it is a film that is presented as a message of hope. As Alpha Robertson passionately exclaims 'God has a greater plan in mind we all serve His purpose in some manner'. This quote is something that Lee presents as a rather speculative inquiry in his film. Was God acting within some enigmatic mode in an attempt to assist people in the realization of the need for equality and fairness in society? Could Queen Nunn's vision of the bloody Sixteenth Street Baptist Church have been a divine premonition? Lee leaves this possibility open to intense scrutiny and supposition. However this approach raises another interesting question within the secular realm that relates to ideas on morality. Is the death of four innocent girls an acceptable loss if it means a greater purpose shall be served? To the family and friends of the victims this is obviously not the case. However to the greater public at large does such a monstrous act become beneficial and perhaps even admissible? Not admissible in the sense of forgivable or understandable but perhaps valuable or advantageous? Did Dr. King and other civil rights leaders exploit the deaths of the children for their own greater cause? These are all very difficult questions that Lee presents within his documentary. It is up to the viewer to come to his or her own distinct conclusion.4 Little Girls raises many interesting possibilities with regards to faith destiny and predetermination. Could these four girls have been chosen by God to serve as martyrs for a righteous cause?

Perhaps their death while tragic ultimately saved many lives by bringing compassion and empathy to a society blinded by hatred.".

	onyx:emotionText "On September 15th 1963 Robert Chambliss murdered four innocent children at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham Alabama. The tragic event resulted in earth shaking ramifications witnessed throughout the country. Millions of people previously unaware of or indifferent to the racial crisis existing within the South were suddenly forced to take issue with a righteous cause that refused to vanish conveniently. The murderer commonly known as 'Dynamite Bob' had hoped to reinforce previously existing segregation laws by committing a desperate act of terrorism against a most sacred and beloved institution. Much to his surprise these violent tendencies only strengthened the Birmingham community in their quest for equitable treatment for all Black citizens. However it should not be forgotten that such a cowardly act caused indescribable grief and unbearable pain for the families of the victims. While the death of these four little girls was undoubtedly a crucial turning point in the civil rights movement it was also a crushing blow dealt to four harmless unsuspecting families. Spike Lee's debut documentary is a film that is engulfed with anger pain and disappointment. At the same time however it is a film that is presented as a message of hope. As Alpha Robertson passionately exclaims 'God has a greater plan in mind we all serve His purpose in some manner'. This quote is something that Lee presents as a rather speculative inquiry in his film. Was God acting within some enigmatic mode in an attempt to assist people in the realization of the need for equality and fairness in society? Could Queen Nunn's vision of the bloody Sixteenth Street Baptist Church have been a divine premonition? Lee leaves this possibility open to intense scrutiny and supposition. However this approach raises another interesting question within the secular realm that relates to ideas on morality. Is the death of four innocent girls an acceptable loss if it means a greater purpose shall be served? To the family and friends of the victims this is obviously not the case. However to the greater public at large does such a monstrous act become beneficial and perhaps even admissible? Not admissible in the sense of forgivable or understandable but perhaps valuable or advantageous? Did Dr. King and other civil rights leaders exploit the deaths of the children for their own greater cause? These are all very difficult questions that Lee presents within his documentary. It is up to the viewer to come to his or her own distinct conclusion.4 Little Girls raises many interesting possibilities with regards to faith destiny and predetermination. Could these four girls have been chosen by God to serve as martyrs for a righteous cause? Could God have been expressing his dissatisfaction or perhaps only attempting to expand the recognition of one of societies greatest ills? Or could this event have been entirely secular in nature could the death of these four girls have been entirely coincidental and ultimately unnecessary? Was the increased awareness of discrimination a justifiable end to the horrific means?

As a documentary it achieves everything it should it informs us it moves us and it reminds us of the evil that we Americans have in our past and still have today. Never forget indeed. It goes without saying that this was an awful act of hatred and bigotry its impact still sharply felt by friends and family of the victims. There is one amusing moment a clip of George Wallace years after the fact trotting out his black best friend for the world to see and the man clearly has contempt for Wallace. Speaking of trotting out however I question the need for Bill Cosby to chime in or Jesse Jackson for that matter. There are plenty of articulate and interesting interviewees already involved without pulling in a couple of celebrity pals. It pulled me out of the film for a moment. Other than that however a strong and memorable film.".

This is a healthy testament to the film. It does not tell the tale of four innocent young victims of racism and guilt you into hailing it as great by the mere fact that it's fact. Lee is very natural and without airs in his command of the subject which is four young girls who were victims of the 1963 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham Alabama by the Ku Klux Klan.Spike has always pursued the noble purpose of using his status as a name director to address issues in the black community but sometimes despite his many great achievements he does not succeed without brandishing the racial chip on his shoulder. At times he can be a hypocrite and at times he indulges in the less favorable aspects of what is considered black culture in America. 4 Little Girls is an honest balanced triumph in poignancy and subjectivity plays no part.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spike Lee's skills as a documentarian are astonishing considering his mixed efforts in dramatic features which ranges from greatness to failures. With 4 Little Girls and especially When the Levees Broke Lee takes focus of the subject matter and expands upon the narrative to make the central story intertwined without losing anything close to worthwhile to know. It goes without saying it honors the memory of those four girls slain in the church in Birmingham but it also honors the memory for the others who died and fought in the Civl Rights battle of the early 60s it was a battle by way of perpetration by the likes of Bull O'Connell and the rabid racists like the only man who was convicted in the late 70s of the church bombing. Lee starts off profiling the girls and their childhoods their parents and childhood friends recounting their innocence their energy being simply kids growing up happy but in the midst of racism all around them. From there Lee branches off using the whitecolored segregation of something as minor as a water fountain to branch off to Birmingham itself its history being the focalpoint of much of the strife for black people in the south Dr. King's eventual and crucial involvement and the white racists. It's staggering information one learns even if one already thinks they know all there is to know about the civil rights struggle. Just the information on Governor George Wallace and surprisingly seeing Wallace interviewed with his neargone voice and mind is enough to raise repeated eyebrows in astonishment.And then Lee brings it back to the girls again and that fateful cursed day that one family member said she saw in a nightmare the night before. The interviews are presented with unabashed compassion for the family members but not with misplaced sentimentality. The case itself and how it becomes one of the pivotal pieces that tragedy besides leads the civil rights movement even further has so much power that it's impossible to dramatize it. Lee simply uses music photographs and the faces of those who knew these girls as well as public figures i.e. Kronkite Cosby Jesse Jackson to accentuate the material. It's skillful storytelling and told with a story that needs to be told and revealed to those who may forget the horrors of the American south merely fortysomething years ago and more. Simply one of the director's finest 'joints'.".

Documentaries give the latter but '4 Little Girls' managed to give me both.I knew this was the story of the bombing of the 16th Street Church in 1964 the killed four little black girls and turned the country on the problem of racial segregation. What I also got from the film was a very vivid portrait of Birmingham Alabama during the time of so much civil unrest.The documentary is directed by Spike Lee but he stays invisible and allows the people who made up the community at the time to tell the story. We hear in over three dozen interviews from family and friends of the victims local politicians celebrities and leaders and followers of Martin Luther King. But most peculiar is former Governor George C. Wallace not long before his death as an old man at the end of his life who represents all old politicians who once boldly stood for segregation mostly out of expediency and now seek redemption.What I learned most from this film is who these girls were and what they left behind. The interviews with family and friends talk about the good times and the bad. The movie never treats these four young girls as tokens in a news story. There is a reality here both sad tragic heartbreaking but also a nice lifegoeson aspect that I found refreshing.I live in Birmingham. You don't hear many people talk about the bombing except occasionally in the media and that is essentially the note that the movie leaves us with. The event was a tragedy it left wounds in the lives of the survivors that will never completely heal. But as the mother of one of the girls says 'So many things have happened since and I just go on and live'.".

Walter Brennan as Judge Roy Bean thoroughly deserved his Academy award though it beats me why he picked up a supporting Oscar instead of a full one. After all his part is about as long as Gary Cooper's. That aside Gregg Toland's photography is a gem and the dialog well ahead of its time. The best thing about it all though is Wyler's disciplined direction. Yes some would argue that the film does not accurately reflect history that Judge Roy Bean died much later and not in a shootout but frankly there is enough prejudice malice and quirky humor in this film for one to know outright that Wyler never intended it as a historical account but rather as a comment on the difficulties of bringing law to the West. Some of it might be dated but Brennan will startle you Cooper is darned slick and it will keep you riveted. Don't miss it!".

But this is one of the top notch hayconsumers of all time make no mistake.What can you say about Gary Cooper that has not already been voiced over and over. His beautifully understated acting style the subtle twitches and raised eyebrows. His bearing. The way he sits a horse as only someone who grew up on a Montana ranch can. The sure enough Western accent. Had he discovered the earpull yet I didn't notice it in this one. Until watching this movie on a newly restored DVD tonight I had not seen it in 20 years and had come to think of it as more of a Walter Brennan movie. I was wrong. Brennan was there with all his fine tools all right and he royally deserved his bestsupporting award but that is what his role was. When it's a Gary Cooper movie it's a Gary Cooper movie. Never having been a fan of High Noon I had thought maybe Dallas or Vera Cruz were Coop's best westerns. But The Westerner gives us the definitive Gary Cooper.The movie is handsomely turned out in the sensuously luminous black and white cinematography fluid editing and silkysmooth scene changes we have come to accept as standard for top studio productions of the late 'thirties 'forties era and every cinematic effect is enhanced by a stirring Dimitri Tiomin score. The sets and costumes are superb with a much more authentic look and feel for the old west than most westerns before or since. The clothes of both the men and women both the cowboys and the farmers the gun leather and the buildings are all unusually accurate to the time and place. Refreshingly the heroine of our piece sensitively and strongly played by the beautiful but obscure Doris Davenport wears a long feminine dress and uses a wagon for transportation rather than wearing men's jeans and riding astraddle a horse with her Tangee lipstick blaring as we see in so many great and small westerns. All the other characters both male and female come off like real 19th century men and women not products of the time in which the film was made. William Wyler's direction is virtually flawless with just the right blend of action tension and humor. But considering the acting talent the cinematographers lighting specialists art directors and other technical help any director in the awesomely efficient big studio systems of the time had available maybe he just knew how to stay out of the way.".

	schema:headline " Cooper in a duel with scenestealing Brennan";
	schema:reviewBody "This western film features several top elements that help make it a classic in its genre.  Director Wyler was regarded by many people as one of the all time greats.  Cinematographer Toland was also a wellrespected presence in his field.  Producer Goldwyn was famed for his attention to quality.  This trio had in fact just made Wuthering Heights together the year before. Then of course there is the delightful and Oscarwinning presence of famed character actor Brennan as Judge Roy Bean.  This is not in any way discounting the work of Cooper who is highly effective and appealing here as well.  Cooper plays the title character a drifter who has the unlucky prospect of having to appear before the notorious hangin' judge Brennan. Once his case is settled he forms an uneasy alliance with Brennan while also sticking around long enough to help damsel in distress Davenport. Before long he's in the middle of a range war between cattle ranchers and farmers all being unfairly presided over by Brennan who has an undue fascination with the actress Lily Langtry.  Cooper is gorgeous in this film and gives a strong performance despite his documented disinterest in it due to the knowledge that Brennan had the best part.  Brennan predictably steals most every scene he's in in a part that is more costarring than supporting.  Still his rapport with Cooper is what gives his role meaning. Although riddled with what are now cliches the script is full of neat touches between the two men.  It's not every day a viewer catches Gary Cooper waking up drunk in a twin bed with Walter Brennan's arm around him! This sequence as well as one earlier when the two men square off over a drink is priceless.  There's also a memorable showdown in an opera house. Davenport makes a lovely if unusual heroine earthier and less slender than many leading ladies of her day.  She would retire shortly after this film. Tucker will be almost unrecognizable to his fans from F Troop and other later works of his.  Andrews is given very little to do.  The film might have been better off with a more apt title as it's less the story of The Westerner than it is an observation of the relationship between these two men.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Westerner 1940 Directed by William Wyler starring Gary Cooper and Walter Brennen. On one level this is a classic tale of the Old West as it struggled through a transition of resettlement. Depicted as such it is a beautifully photographed well acted gritty weird funny and emotional story. But this film was also made in 1940. The Germans had begun their sweep across Europe they were breaking treaties as fast as necessary and nonmilitarized countries could not withstand the armed renegade country bent on following no rules but its own. To think that this was not on the minds of The Westerner's writers directors and audience would be nave. It's a perfect representation of current events in Europe England and America  as of 1940. 1941 would change that. I found it fascinating from this perspective  watching it with something of the same gut level understanding that people in that time would have certainly felt. Cooper was the outsider who had no real attachments and wanted to remain isolated  keeping his freedom and avoiding entanglements. The town run by despot Judge Roy Bean made their own laws convicted everyone in their way and hung them without a second thought. The farmers were seen as an impediment to their expanding ideas which required more and more land and water. Cooper was drawn into the battle of ideologies and attempted to become the ambassador aiming for peace not war. He moved slowly and lost the trust of everyone  until it was made very clear to him that the aggressors had no intention of honoring promises. It was time to take sides. It is PERFECT representation of that and our we the Westerners time.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an outdoor epic about land war in which director William Wyler offers us a solid absorbent and entertaining film . The Westerner is an intense and rewarding western  which is filmed on location in Arizona. Nominated for 3 Oscars actor cast art direction and original screenplay won one for Walter Brennan who sparkles as judge who dispenses frontier justice in the days of wild west. The film explores the tensions and fights faced by the old farmers and new settlers landowners engaged in the operation of small farms erected through the efforts of their work . It focuses on the conflicting interests of the two groups their diverse working methods  struggles and different visions of the country and world . Within this scenario is the showdown among two two antagonists  a drifter addicted to freedom named Cole Harden featured by an unforgettable Cooper a sly  soft spoken cowboy who champions Texas border homesteaders in a range war  Cole is a former outlaw and become socially integrated while legendary Judge Roy Bean Brennan's Academy Award was his third playing a shrew piece of villainy known as The law west of the Pecos  sentences Hardin hang as a horse thief . Cole then falls for damsel Jane Ellen Doris Davenport and stays in the area advocating for the rights of homesteaders  Cole has to have an ending confrontation with the judge . With these characters the film explores the misery and the greatness of the human condition. Gary Cooper was 39 years when he played in this movie and he was a very famous player . The film gave Cooper one of the best of his laconic  strong characters as the cowboy caught among opposing factions  in other hand Walter Brennan composing the reply and gives a role of cruel judge but that is nice  capable at the same time being brutal and relentlessly hanging whatever suspect . The film describes the institutional and administrative instability that prevails in wide zones of western border underscores the friendship companionship honesty sense of adventure enterprise and justice sentence drills by unscrupulous and dishonest people.The narrative is vivid and vibrant. The story is presented polished stylish and free of nonessential items. The dialogues are sharp and funny peppered with humor. The film includes spectacular scenes fastpaced and iconography amalgam of the old silent westerns with romantic references characteristic of modern western.It's also a comedy Brennan and Cooper have a fun relationship during the first half hour of the movie you think we will soon lead to a happy ending which ultimately will result but one of the two dead. Furthermore movie debuts of actors Dana Andrews and Forrest Tucker. William Wyler exceed film genres and built an excellent film from the first minutes the feeling of coherence and emphasis that produces the majority of which went over his career.Amazing cinematography by Cregg Toland citizen Kane places an emphasis on the realism of the action and splendid frames  which is one of the best things of the movie with spectacular scenes as the fire. Emotive and stirring musical score by the classic Dimitri Tiomkin . Wyler looking camera concealed positions that sees without being seen observed with curiosity and interest and look for the pleasure of seeing. The film made by a young Wyler 37 years is solid absorbing and entertaining.There are moments like burning down crops that technically is wonderful . Some rides from Cooper or fighting in the middle of the country  so are scenes impossible to forget.The Bean 's role is based on actual events as Roy Bean 18251903 was a nearilliterate frontier justice of the peace who ran a combined courtsaloon in the tiny railroad hamlet of Langtry in the West Texas desert between the River Pecos and the Rio Grande . He was known as the Lay west of the Pecos . He was running a saloon in a tenttown for railroad builders called Vinegaroon . Ben  backed by the Texas Rangers and the railroad  was appointed Justice of the peace  although he had never studied law . He managed to keep the peace with a strange brand of common and rough sense  often basing his ruling on a single law book . The stories about him are legion most apocryphal . The fines usually stayed in his pocket and he acquitted accused on condition that he buy a round of drinks for the boys . The law of the Pecos was a law unto himself . He got himself elected Langtry's justice of the peace  holding court in his crude saloon called the Jersey Lily where he lived till his death in 1903 . In 1896 he brought fame to Langtry by staging the FitzsmmonsPeter Maher heavyweightboxing championship. He also performed marriages  ending the short ceremony with the worlds I Roy Bean  justice of the peace  hereby pronounce man and wife . May God have mercy on your souls. Bean's Jersey Lily has been preserved by the Texas Highway Department and is now a tourist attraction.".

He got himself elected Langtry's justice of the peace  holding court in his crude saloon called the Jersey Lily where he lived till his death in 1903 .

	schema:reviewBody "Judge Roy Bean was a real historical figure but the colourful myths that have sprung up out of what is know of his undoubtedly colourful life have made him a ripe subject for a number of largely fictional movies. There was a TV series in the 50s and a bizarre yet brilliant Paul Newman picture in 1973 but Bean could just as easily appear as a stock supporting character in somebody else's story. In The Westerner he is the antagonist for one of Gary Cooper's upstanding Western heroes in what is purportedly a tale of conflict between the cowboys and the farmers in old Texas. But whose story is this really? The judge is played by that superb character actor Walter Brennan in the third and most wellearned of his three Oscarwinning appearances. Brennan was often a cheerfully silly comedy player but here his performance is wonderfully subdued. He barely seems to move but his hypnotic presence and moody drawl seem to draw you into the screen. Cooper is similarly subtle and some of the best moments in the picture are just the two of them silently staring each other down. There's a lot of work with props here such as the ubiquitous shot glasses or the lock of hair and it really helps to build up character and atmosphere. There is also a strong emotional turn from female lead Doris Davenport whose career would probably have taken off had she not shortly afterwards been severely injured in a car crash.Director William Wyler was known for overseeing competent and smartly understated acting performances and while I have written extensively about this in my reviews of his other pictures this time I'm going to talk about his view of the West. Wyler cut his teeth making Western shorts in the silent era and once quipped that he used to lie awake thinking of new ways for someone to get on or off a horse. The way he does things here however is very different to the approaches John Ford or Raoul Walsh. For the first half of The Westerner the Western landscape is barely seen. Most of the scenes take place indoors and not even a reminder of what lies beyond can be glimpsed through the window. During Cooper's trial the judge's pals press around the frame like a human wall enclosing things further. Of course there are outdoor shots but these seem inconsequential and are certainly not there to show off the beauty or grandeur of the landscape which appears spiky and full of dry brush and stones. Then about fifty or so minutes in as Cooper's moral stance in defending the homesteaders and his romance with Davenport begin to unfold so too does the glory of the plains Wyler treating us to aesthetic pastoral scenes to reflect the change in tone. It doesn't last however and for the tense finale we are back to closeted interiors.In part because of this late and brief blossoming of the scenery and despite all the guns dust and whiskey The Westerner ironically doesn't really feel like a Western. It is more in the way of an Old West drama. Yes it does feature Judge Roy Bean iconic figure of the West and it does star Gary Cooper iconic actor of the Western and it is even packaged as a progress Western about the settling of the land. But the performances are so intense the relationship between Cooper and Brennan so fullyfleshed that the context disappears and the opening spiel about range wars and homesteaders is soon forgotten. What remains is a compelling tale of the battle of wits between two men one old and experienced but blinded by obsession the other young and sharpwitted. The legend of Roy Bean and his young nemesis takes on a grand stature here and either one could be the Westerner of the title.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Best Supporting Oscar debuted in 1937 and within five years Walter Brennan won the award three times. There was Come and Get It in 1937 Kentucky in 1939 and The Westerner in 1941. That feat in itself is a record that still stands and fans of Brennan can get a pretty good idea of his talent with the portrayal of Judge Roy Bean offered here. Played straight but with good comedic effect Brennan spars nicely with Gary Cooper in a Western I was glad to come across on Turner Classics the other night.For Cooper this was an unusual role. With that smug cat that ate the canary look on his face for a good percentage of the time it was hard to tell if his character was on the up and up or not. Case in point when he challenged King Evans Tom Tyler as the guy who sold him the stolen horse. Watching that scene the thought crossed my mind that Cole Harden Cooper just might have set him up to take the fall with the judge. Just like he set up the judge himself with the Lily Langtry story. He then proceeds to milk it for all he's worth even softening up Jane Ellen Doris Davenport for that lock of hair. Cooper's Harden might be one of the best con men in Westerns I've ever come across.Written by famed Wyatt Earp chronicler Stuart Lake no stranger to stories of fiction based on fact The Westerner offers a lot of neat morsels to the viewer paying attention. That early scene utilizing a trip wire to take down a steer would never pass muster today the animal folded like an accordion. Vinegarroon's town dentist doubled as a mortician with the price tag to bury Shad Wilkins a mere four dollars. I presume that included the casket what a deal. In terms of drama the prairie fire initiated by the judge's henchmen is one of the more dramatic and exciting scenes you're likely to find going this far back in the genre. My advice by gobs would be to pull up a chair and catch this when you can with a trusty bottle of 'Rub o' the Brush' by your side.".

Absolutely love William Wyler as a director the number of classic films he did are countless. The story sounded interesting as did the character of Judge Roy Bean. Personally like Gary Cooper and this is the sort of role he always played very well indeed. Walter Brennan always shone in support.'The Westerner' didn't disappoint me. When it comes to Westerns while it's not one of my very favourites it is one of the most fascinating and most accessible as well as well made and entertaining. One of those Westerns where even those that dislike the genre normally are likely to find a lot to love or at least appreciate and those that do already love the genre will love it even more. 'The Westerner' represents everybody involved extremely well indeed and deserves the positivity it has always gotten.Almost everything is done right no brilliantly even. 'The Westerner' is a very audaciously photographed film with a lot of atmosphere with some sweeping camera angles that prevent the film from looking static or stage bound. The setting looks handsome and is evocative. Dmitri Tiomkin's music score is typically luscious and atmospheric with clever complex and beautifully balanced structuring of his moodenhancing themes his distinctive style when reading up about it and people analysing it it was incredibly illuminating and made me appreciate him even more.Wyler directs immaculately directing with typically impeccable taste intensity and class. Although he was a notorious perfectionist 'The Westerner' never struck me as clinical or emotionally cold and although Westerns is not a genre one normally associates Wyler with he doesn't seem uncomfortable in it. The script is clever and taut especially towards the end and especially in the interactions between Harden and Bean. The story is always compelling there is a lightheartedness in places but a not held back grit in others. Absolutely loved how the entertaining relationship between Harden and Bean was handled.Some of my friends consider Cooper on the wooden side and dull generally personally don't agree. Not every role suited him especially early on but this role does and perfectly. At his best his acting is appreciatively natural and restrained and also with personal touches which was pretty much what his whole acting style was and all of that can be seen here in 'The Westerner'. Other Western leads may have more intensity but Cooper underplays beautifully here and is likeable. Doris Davenport brings a lot of heart and charm to the picture and her character is more than just a plot device in no way does his role slow the plotting down or feel like padding. Best of all is Brennan in a ferocious performance that is both sinister and charming how he managed to make an evil character likeable says a lot about how good an actor he was at his best. He did deserve the Oscar he got for his performance here but would make a strong case of him actually being a colead rather than supporting.My only issue and actually this is minor was that the ending could have done with more tension and not been as too neat.Otherwise a great film and well worth catching. 910".

	schema:headline " A terrific performance by Walter Brennan makes The Westerner a keeper. Now where is the DVD?";
	schema:reviewBody "Gary Cooper may be the star but it's Walter Brennan as Judge Roy Bean the law west of the Pecos who drives The Westerner and makes the movie interesting. William Wyler such a superb director has somehow given us two movies. The first one is about you guessed it sodbusters regular folks like you and me who according to Hollywood just want to put down roots raise their families and build decent lives. The husbands are always pulling out tree stumps and the wives are always whomping up pies. Against them ride the cattlemen and every clich in the book is thrown into this part of The Westerner's story. The second movie however is a sly sometimes funny and somewhat vicious story of Judge Bean his dictatorial character and his obsession with Lily Langtry a beautiful singer from over the seas and a woman the Judge has idealized for years. The two stories come together when Cole Hardin Gary Cooper drifts into the dusty collection of ramshackle buildings close to the Mexican border where the Judge runs things. Before Hardin can wet his whistle in the Judge's bar and courtroom he's accused of being a horse thief. It takes only a few minutes for the jury to find him guilty and the Judge to pronounce sentence...hanging and right now. Hardin has enough wits to notice all the pictures of the Jersey Lily the Judge has nailed to the walls so he makes up a story about how he knows her he even has a memento of her hair. That's enough for the Judge to postpone the hanging. Before long Hardin and the Judge are downing whiskey together Don't spill none of that liquor son. It eats right into the bar. while the Judge listens with open mouth to the stories Hardin tells about Lily Langtry. While all this is going on those homesteaders are building fences. The Judge doesn't take kindly to this. He's going to run them off by any means it takes. While Hardin is trying to find a middle way he just happens to fall for the daughter of one of the sodbusters. Soon he's taking their side while trying to keep the Judge from doing anything murderous. It doesn't work. The fields and homes are burned and Hardin decides that the Judge himself needs a little justice. When the Judge hears that Miss Langtry will be performing in Fort Davis a two day's ride away the stage is set for a dramatic shootout between the Judge and Hardin. What makes this entertaining is Walter Brennan as Roy Bean. The Judge is a mean bad tempered poorly washed bully. His word runs things and his guns his noose and his followers make it happen. Justice with the Judge is a relative thing. But when he says That's my rulin' he means it. In a tour de force performance Brennan somehow manages to make the man both a reprobate and likable. When Brennan played Pa Clanton in My Darling Clementine he was a mean old man to the bone. Here his deep deep infatuation with Lily Langtry doesn't make him any more likable but Brennan makes him just a little vulnerable. And in a nice bit of actorly sharing Gary Cooper when he's acting with Brennan becomes much more interesting. If Cole Hardin is going to keep his neck from being stretched he has to find ways to keep the Judge on the hook. Then when Cole Hardin is trying to keep the Judge from ripping into the homesteaders he has to find a way to appeal to the Judge's vanity. Cooper with the homesteaders is Cooper as usual. Cooper with Brennan is shrewd and a little sly it's a fine performance. The conclusion in the music hall at Fort Davis when Cooper and Brennan finally shoot it out and when the Judge at last meets the Jersey Lily is not only exciting it's moving as all get out. The Westerner has developed a fine reputation over the years but I suppose it's largely because the movie is so seldom seen. We keep hearing about a DVD release happening any day but it hasn't shown up yet. If it ever does I'm sure Walter Brennan's performance will continue to get all the acclaim it deserves. I'm sure the chemistry between Brennan and Cooper will be examined and praised. As for the rest of the movie I'm not so sure. For those who like to get in their cars and journey to interesting places I recommend driving down Texas state highway 90 heading to West Texas and the Rio Grande. You'll eventually find Langtry Texas not named for Lily Langtry and Judge Bean's wooden barroom the Jersey Lily and adjoining courtroom. It still stands a few paces from a state information center. Langtry is about as close to being a ghost town as you can get. The only drinks you'll find is cool water from the center's water fountain. If you're there in the summer you'll need it. After you've prowled around and bought a few postcards continue on to Fort Davis. It's a pleasant very small west Texas town. You can visit the old Army fort now run by the U. S. Park Service go up to the Davis Observatory for a star show and stay a night or two at the staterun Indian Lodge in the Davis Mountains. The lodge is just five minutes or so from town.".

	onyx:emotionText "Gary Cooper may be the star but it's Walter Brennan as Judge Roy Bean the law west of the Pecos who drives The Westerner and makes the movie interesting. William Wyler such a superb director has somehow given us two movies. The first one is about you guessed it sodbusters regular folks like you and me who according to Hollywood just want to put down roots raise their families and build decent lives. The husbands are always pulling out tree stumps and the wives are always whomping up pies. Against them ride the cattlemen and every clich in the book is thrown into this part of The Westerner's story. The second movie however is a sly sometimes funny and somewhat vicious story of Judge Bean his dictatorial character and his obsession with Lily Langtry a beautiful singer from over the seas and a woman the Judge has idealized for years. The two stories come together when Cole Hardin Gary Cooper drifts into the dusty collection of ramshackle buildings close to the Mexican border where the Judge runs things. Before Hardin can wet his whistle in the Judge's bar and courtroom he's accused of being a horse thief. It takes only a few minutes for the jury to find him guilty and the Judge to pronounce sentence...hanging and right now. Hardin has enough wits to notice all the pictures of the Jersey Lily the Judge has nailed to the walls so he makes up a story about how he knows her he even has a memento of her hair. That's enough for the Judge to postpone the hanging. Before long Hardin and the Judge are downing whiskey together Don't spill none of that liquor son. It eats right into the bar. while the Judge listens with open mouth to the stories Hardin tells about Lily Langtry. While all this is going on those homesteaders are building fences. The Judge doesn't take kindly to this. He's going to run them off by any means it takes. While Hardin is trying to find a middle way he just happens to fall for the daughter of one of the sodbusters. Soon he's taking their side while trying to keep the Judge from doing anything murderous. It doesn't work. The fields and homes are burned and Hardin decides that the Judge himself needs a little justice. When the Judge hears that Miss Langtry will be performing in Fort Davis a two day's ride away the stage is set for a dramatic shootout between the Judge and Hardin. What makes this entertaining is Walter Brennan as Roy Bean. The Judge is a mean bad tempered poorly washed bully. His word runs things and his guns his noose and his followers make it happen. Justice with the Judge is a relative thing. But when he says That's my rulin' he means it. In a tour de force performance Brennan somehow manages to make the man both a reprobate and likable. When Brennan played Pa Clanton in My Darling Clementine he was a mean old man to the bone. Here his deep deep infatuation with Lily Langtry doesn't make him any more likable but Brennan makes him just a little vulnerable. And in a nice bit of actorly sharing Gary Cooper when he's acting with Brennan becomes much more interesting. If Cole Hardin is going to keep his neck from being stretched he has to find ways to keep the Judge on the hook. Then when Cole Hardin is trying to keep the Judge from ripping into the homesteaders he has to find a way to appeal to the Judge's vanity. Cooper with the homesteaders is Cooper as usual.

	schema:reviewBody "Walter Brennan whose movie this is is Judge Roy Bean the ruler of the tiny frontier town of Vinagaroon Texas. He's a hanging judge. Everybody that comes into his bar room cum court room is guilty and they are all hanged whatever the offense. Brennan's character is one of those blustering military heroes  William F. Halsey George S. Patton Howlin' Mad Smith. They are always angry and aggressive. They bark out orders. They brook no insubordination. And they usually have some humanizing weakness or quirk  Halsey discomfort at getting injections Patton's vanity that sort of thing. Brennan fits the mold. His weakness is his adoration of the actress Lilly Langtry. The difference between the arrogant military commanders and Brennan's character is that the commanders channel their prodigious selfconfidence into socially approved acts while Judge Roy Bean had no aspirations higher than maintaining his position as corrupt king of Vinagaroon perfectly comfortable in his authoritarian skin.But Brennan's weakness humanizes him too. We disapprove of his hanging people all the time and making up his rulings as he goes along to suit his own aggrandizement but we can also empathize with his worship of a star of the theater whom he has little chance of meeting. He's like a murderous philatelist pining for a rare stamp.Gary Cooper is a minimalist actor along the lines of Robert Redford but he's very good at signaling what's going on in his head with only the slightest change of expression. He's accused of horse stealing in Vinagaroom and is about to be hanged. Then he divines Brennan's devotion and claims that he not only MET Lilly Langtry but has a lock of her hair stashed in El Paso. His sentence is forgotten and an accommodation arranged. It leads to a shoot out at the end in which Brennan dies but not before he satisfies his life's desire and has a glimpse of Lilly Langtry.The movie's iconography gives the impression that it's just another Western actioner but it isn't that. Oh there's a dreary actress Doris Davenport to provide Cooper with a romantic interest but William Wyler the director and Niven Busch the writer make full use of every tool at their disposal including the supernumerary girl.I'll give just two brief examples of unusually good writing and direction. 1 Having promised Brennan to deliver a lock of Lilly Langtry's hair which he never had Cooper is compelled to bring back a fake. The only woman around is Davenport. Cooper and Davenport are leaning on a wooden fence and she is berating him for something or other while he smiles smoothly snipping carelessly at his buckskin fringe and he delicately lifts a strand of her long hair scissors poised. She stops talking and pouts. Can I take a little? asks Cooper. Then a pause and  SNIP  and she snaps out No! just a fraction of a second too late. It's not much but it's an expression of some of the effort that went into the writing and direction. What I mean is  somebody had to THINK about that little exchange in order to make it as humanly amusing as it is.Example two  briefer. Cooper returns to Brennan with the promised lock of hair tucked away in a matchbox inside a tobacco pouch with a draw string. As the two men sit together Cooper reaches inside his shirt. Wrong side. With the most deliberate of movements he reaches into the other side of the shirt. Brennan meanwhile is bouncing up and down with anticipation like a child about to see a Christmas present unwrapped. It's all done without dialog. Cooper finally slowly extracts the pouch and gently tries to pull it open. But the draw string is stuck and the pouch is intractable. Cooper tugs at it tugs again  and Brennan's tense empty hands mimic Cooper's motions impatiently.An added bonus is one of the better next day scenes in the movies. Brennan and Cooper two mutually wary shorttime friends get blind drunk on a local whiskey that has the power to eat through the bar. Cooper wakes up the next morning to find himself in the same narrow cot as Brennan and with the snoring Brennan's arm around him. Cooper clambers clumsily out of the bunk and when he nudges Brennan's arm a hidden ace falls out of the sleeve.I can't go on because I'll run out of space and anyway I'm laughing too hard. Its high user rating is justified. You'll probably get a kick out of it.".

I really wasn't sure what to expect from this film but it turned out to be a really good movie with some terrific performances and a classic comedy scene that is among the best I've ever seen. Needless to say both Cooper and Brennan are wonderful in the film and really turn this western into a near comic masterpiece. The opening scenes when Cooper is on trial for his life the way he and Brennan discuss Lily Langtry is pure genius from the acting and directing standpoint. The way the two actors play off each others lines and facial gestures makes for plenty of laugh out loud moments. Wyler's comic timing in the editing and directing is top notch and really makes this scene something beautiful to watch. Wyler's direction during the fire sequence is also top notch and makes for a rather suspenseful scene. The film is a tad bit odd in how over the top it is in laughs and at the same time so serious in the way Bean acts. Doris Davenport is equally good as the tough as nail homesteader and I was shocked to see she only did one movie after this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Roger Ebert introduced The Cole Rule which is 'no movie made since 1977 containing a character with the first name Cole has been any good.' The Westerner starring Gary Cooper as Cole Harden came out in 1940.The film centers around Harden and Roy Bean Walter Brennan the barman and selfproclaimed judge of Vinegaroon Texas. Bean has a tendency of serving capital punishment as easily as he serves whiskey. When Harden shows up on the scenethe classic drifter who comes from no place in particular and who's going no place specialtelling tales of trysts with Lily Langtry Bean's hanging ways are brought to a halt at least for a little while. You see Bean is madly in love with Langtry a famous actress despite not ever meeting or seeing her in the person in fact he has pictures of her plastered over nearly ever squareinch of his bar and bedroom. As great as Cooper is as the reluctant hero of aboveaverage intelligence Brennan is the star delivering one ofif not the best ofhis performances. He inhabits a judge Roy Bean who's at both times dangerous and pitiful. In his initial intellectual face off with Hardenwhich quickly devolves into empty feats of masculinityBean comes off as a fierce nononsense sociopath incapable of sentiment. However at the mere mention of Langtry his face melts into a picture of childish affection. He's so good that despite being the antagonist the ways in which the hero manipulates Bean's schoolboy crush are borderline heartbreaking. Brennan rightly won the Academy Award that year. The Westerner is also home to one of the alltime great shootouts. It's comically realistic as these aren't two sharpshooters but they know how a gun works. So naturally they run around shooting blindly and hiding behind things as anybody in a shootout would. To boot there's an orchestra between the two of them so occasionally a bullet will graze an instrument creating a natural offbeat score to match the scene.In 1972 John Huston released another film based on the legend of Bean entitled The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean starring Paul Newman as the judge which is likewise an outstanding film. It's been a while since I've seen it so I can't compare the two movies like I wish I could.Given the eclectic personality of the reallife Bean The Westerner is a refreshingly quirky western and is worthy of its source material.".

To boot there's an orchestra between the two of them so occasionally a bullet will graze an instrument creating a natural offbeat score to match the scene.In 1972 John Huston released another film based on the legend of Bean entitled The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean starring Paul Newman as the judge which is likewise an outstanding film. It's been a while since I've seen it so I can't compare the two movies like I wish I could.Given the eclectic personality of the reallife Bean The Westerner is a refreshingly quirky western and is worthy of its source material.";

	schema:reviewBody "Sharpe's Mission is one of those rarities in the Sharpe movie series a chapter that isn't based on an original book. The films had of course never fit the books entirely especially Sharpe's Gold which bares little resemblance to the source novel but Mission was the first time the cast and crew opted to make a story completely from the ground up. Fans of the series need not worry though and while it may not be as good as Sharpe's Company or Sharpe's Battle it still delivers a solid hour and forty minutes of peninsular war entertainment.Sharpe's job this time around is to journey into enemy territory along with a sizable force and blow up a French supply fortress that is laden with ammunition. Joining him is the usual supporting cast of loyal riflemen duplicitous officers and a variety of heroic misfits. Not least amongst these is Pyecroft Nigel Betts a hook handed explosives expert with half his face missing who spends most of the story hiding behind a black leather mask and whose sympathetic romance with a gypsy girl engineers the requisite tugging of the heart strings even if it isn't entirely fleshed out. Additionally there's Mark Strong putting in a fine role as the standard Nemesis Of The Week Major Brand. His is an interesting character as Brand is not your usual snivelling Public School Toff turned idiot officer but a ruthless soldier who Sharpe actually respects and admires though of course this changes come the finale.Possibly the most entertaining performance though can be found in Warren Saire's portrayal of Shillington a journalist from London who has come to write about the war and winds up trying to seduce Sharpe's wife. Watching him prance around in his expensive clothes and ridiculous top hat fainting at the sight of mutilated bodies and fawning over Jane is utterly hilarious especially when he finds Harris picking holes in his intellectual musings and ham fisted poetry.As usual no Sharpe movie would be complete with a massive ruck to round things off and once again the luckless French army get a sound kicking. Surrounded in the fortress they're trying to blow up the English find themselves battling a force that outnumbers them five to one and having to rely on hastily put together grenades and their own toughness to survive. It may be a bit short by the usual standards but once again the production team don't see their budget as a setback. It's not Helm's Deep by any means but it's still an action packed finale to get the blood pumping.In short if you've seen any of the preceding Sharpe movies or read one of the books you'll know what to expect. The lack of a base novel to draw inspiration from doesn't hamper it in any way and the only real setback is that in places it gets a bit slow and it just isn't quite as exciting as some of the other episodes. Plus Harper doesn't get as much screen time as usual and is mostly in the background throughout. Still if you're a fan of the series or even just a casual Sean Bean fan you'll find plenty to sink your teeth into as it delivers more of the blood guts military macho and heaving breasts that have made Sharpe such a popular character.".

	schema:headline " Brilliant sequel to Yamazaki's awardwinning 2005 film ....";
	schema:reviewBody "Always Zoku San Cho Me No Yuhi is the much anticipated followup to director Yamazaki Takashi's exceptional 2005 film Always San Cho No Yuhi which swept the Japan Academy Awards for that year.Based on the the popular manga series Yuyake No UtaSan Chome No Yuhi by Saigan Ryohei Always was a nostalgic touching time capsule look at life in Tokyo's shitamachi working class districts amidst the backdrop of the construction of the Tokyo Tower during the late 50s.A box office sensation Winning both critical and audience acclaim Always ended with a bit of a cliffhanger and it was only a matter of time before a sequel was made.Always Zoku directly follows the events of the previous movie and begins with a dynamic crowd pleasing opening featuring the familiar movie monster Godzilla that puts the recent Cloverfield to shame with its visual mayhem.This is part of an elaborate dream sequence belonging to struggling writer Chagawa RyunosukeYoshioka Hidetaka who is still writing kids fiction stories while trying to get more serious writing assignments.Yet life is good for Chagawa and his young ward Junnosuke Suga Kenta but their happiness is soon put to the test as Junnosuke's estranged father Kawabata Kohinata Fumiyo makes another bid at trying to take custody of the child. He gives Chagawa an ultimatum that should he fail to properly raise and care for Junnosuke he will take the child away to live with him.Chagawa vows to turn around his aimless life and sets his sights on trying to win the prestigious Akutagawasho literary award.As Chagawa struggles with his uncertain future the Suzuki family deals with a family problem of their own. A distant relative has come to them to ask them to care for his young daughter MikaKoike Ayame while he deals with a struggling business in the country. Privledged arrogant and spoiled Mika is at first appalled with her new living arrangements and complains about everything from the lack of a proper TV to the humble food. While garage owner Suzuki Norifumi Tsutsumi Shinichi and wife Tomoe Yakushimaru Hiroko show restrained patience with the girl vocal son IppeiKoshimizu Kazuki gives Mika a piece of his mind and chides the girl for her selfishness and ingratitude. The two strong willed children dislike each other at first but soon begin to warm up to one another. Mika also develops a special bond with Tomoe who becomes like a second mother to the girl Mika lost her mother while still an infant.Meanwhile young high school intern Hoshino Rokko Mutsuko Horikita Maki has firmly established herself as part of the Suzuki family and is slowly learning how to become a mechanic. A former high school classmate Nakayama Takeo Asai Yosuke a high school crush happens by the shop and they soon develop a bit of a romance.Former bar hostess Ishizaki Hiromi Koyuki is also adjusting to her newfound life as a burlesque dancer at a local cabaret and now goes by the name of Betty. While she is surrounded by rich admirers and suitors she still longs for the simple life that she left back at San Chome Me and eagerly waits for Chagawa to come for her as he had promised.Director Yamazaki and writing partner Kosawa Ryota again turn in a terrific and poignant script which strikes all the right positive and dramatic notes. Although some may find all the Showa sentimentality and references a bit puzzling especially for those 30 years and younger I found it a fascinating if but idealized look at life in Tokyo during the 50s.The SFX and model work VFX by Shibuya Kiyoko are again absolutely extraordinary particularly the detailed recreations of old Nihonbashi Haneda Airport Tokyo Station and the newly constructed Tokyo Tower. It is truly breathtaking and wonderful to behold. The cast is remarkable and special recognition should go to both Yakushimaru Hiroko Sailor Fuku To Kikanjuu W No Higeki Bubble E Go! and Koyuki Alive Last Samurai Kairo in their supporting roles. Koyuki was the standout this time in her role as HiromiBetty and brought much vulnerability and charm to her role. I couldn't help but cry as she struggled with her feelings for the socially inept Chagura. Her scenes were the most touching and heartfelt I thought. If there are any problems with the film it is in its absolute idealism and overly positive attitude and outlook. There were no real villains in the film and everyone even the children are shown to be virtuous and righteous people who seem almost too perfect to be real. Perhaps that was Yamazaki's intention to present an idealized and near perfect vision of the 50s but it does strike as a bit of a biased viewpoint and Yamazaki only briefly touches upon some of the social issues and problems that were occurring during the time the kakusa shakai  stark discrepancy between the rich and the poor rampant crime and theft juvenile delinquency and unemployment. Always Zoku tells the story of a time in Japan when there was an abundance of hope and optimism for a bright promising future. While current times are rough for many Japanese perhaps Always Zoke can serve as a reminder that the Japanese have overcome many obstacles and adversities in the past and can do so again now and in the future.".

The Tower is now finished. You still have the over the top SuzukiSan you have Chagawa who still pines for Hiromi continues to struggle as a writer and still faces uncertainty as to keeping Junnosuke with him. In this film the pretty Roku gets a boyfriend and the Suzuki family takes in a young girl who is a cousin. She is at first very tentative but soon becomes part of the family. Like in the first film things happen which make you laugh and cry. The laughs are even more frequent and include a visit from Godzilla! The difference in this film is that the characters like each other more which is just a great thing. This film like the first is just excellent a feel good film that though sentimental is never overbearing. I love these characters. I would guess movie number three is in the works as there is so much more for these characters to say and experience. You need to watch the first installment before you see this but its such a treat to see both. Both films have my highest recommendation. They are both excellent.".

	schema:reviewBody "As my wife said the first part of the sequel was very good we saw this second part together. Unfortunately without knowing the background of the characters I could not empathize at all. I told her the story seemed too much manipulated and I did not empathize it. She said she felt natural. Therefore I strongly recommend seeing the first part before this one.VFX effects are amazing. Tokyo scenes in the late 1950's are recreated in detail. I first saw the river at Nihonbashi bridge without highway above it. Now the river is cleaner than the movie. Yes the rivers of Tokyo in high economic growth period was that dirty.By the way the locale is set to Tokyo in 1959. In 1959 I was almost the same age with the children in this movie. That time there was a radio drama series 1 1st street and a TV drama series Backstreet. Both dramas portrayed daily life at a backstreet in Tokyo. I was a kid in a local city but was fascinated in the dramas with cordial atmospheres. The word ALWAYS in this movie title may imply to portray daily life too. But I feel every episode is too dramatically manipulated to be ALWAYS but ONE TIME. By the way the subject of the novel Chagawa chose for his masterpiece is good.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Life Aquatic is most certainly an unusual film. It's something of a collage of colorful imagery fragmented shots quirky music strange characters bizarre situations and amusing montages. But if one had seen Wes Anderson's previous films one would expect nothing less.It can't really be helped that there be a certain amount of hype around Anderson's name after all his films Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums both generated vast critical acclaim and three of this young director's four films have already received the Criterion DVD treatment. Is the buzz warranted? I say absolutely. Anderson has created some of the most vibrant vivid unique and offbeat films of the last decade and The Life Aquatic is no exception.The film follows Steve Zissou Murray a formerly glorious oceanographer whose latest documentary which is about his closest friend and colleague Esteban being eaten by a Jaguar Shark receives a lessthanglorious reception. Steve then announces he plans to set out on a voyage to film part two of his documentary which will follow him and his crew as they attempt to track down the alleged Jaguar Shark. Along for the ride is Ned Wilson someone who may or may not be Steve's son Jane Blanchett an upandcoming journalist doing a story on Zissou Klaus Dafoe the eccentric German first mate a Portugese David Bowiecovering weapons expert a nononsense tech expert a usually seminude female crewmember a band of unpaid interns and several other quirky personalities. Other characters include Zissou's estranged wife Eleanor Huston and her former husband Alistair Hennessey Goldblum. On the journey the crew encounters money problems relationship issues and...pirates.The film takes place in a vivid world that is somewhat inside Steve's head. A colorful world where the creatures are claymation and where Steve can singlehandedly ward off kidnapping gunwielding pirates to beat of The Stooges' Search and Destroy.I do warn you though if you are not a fan of dry humor this one's most likely not for you. The movie's loaded with it in all of its offbeat tongueincheek antiglory.There are some wonderful acting performances throughout including an exuberant Bill Murray who just loses himself in the character of Zissou a subdued Anjelica Huston whose subtle sly grins and deadpan delivery develop her character far more than anything else and a spirited Willem Dafoe who manages to make a German accent sound funnier than I ever imagined it could.If you enjoyed Rushmore The Royal Tenenbaums PunchDrunk Love or I Heart Huckabees then you most certainly should not let this charming oddly beautiful little film pass beneath your radar.9.510".

Is the buzz warranted? I say absolutely. Anderson has created some of the most vibrant vivid unique and offbeat films of the last decade and The Life Aquatic is no exception.The film follows Steve Zissou Murray a formerly glorious oceanographer whose latest documentary which is about his closest friend and colleague Esteban being eaten by a Jaguar Shark receives a lessthanglorious reception. Steve then announces he plans to set out on a voyage to film part two of his documentary which will follow him and his crew as they attempt to track down the alleged Jaguar Shark. Along for the ride is Ned Wilson someone who may or may not be Steve's son Jane Blanchett an upandcoming journalist doing a story on Zissou Klaus Dafoe the eccentric German first mate a Portugese David Bowiecovering weapons expert a nononsense tech expert a usually seminude female crewmember a band of unpaid interns and several other quirky personalities. Other characters include Zissou's estranged wife Eleanor Huston and her former husband Alistair Hennessey Goldblum. On the journey the crew encounters money problems relationship issues and...pirates.The film takes place in a vivid world that is somewhat inside Steve's head. A colorful world where the creatures are claymation and where Steve can singlehandedly ward off kidnapping gunwielding pirates to beat of The Stooges' Search and Destroy.I do warn you though if you are not a fan of dry humor this one's most likely not for you. The movie's loaded with it in all of its offbeat tongueincheek antiglory.There are some wonderful acting performances throughout including an exuberant Bill Murray who just loses himself in the character of Zissou a subdued Anjelica Huston whose subtle sly grins and deadpan delivery develop her character far more than anything else and a spirited Willem Dafoe who manages to make a German accent sound funnier than I ever imagined it could.If you enjoyed Rushmore The Royal Tenenbaums PunchDrunk Love or I Heart Huckabees then you most certainly should not let this charming oddly beautiful little film pass beneath your radar.9.510";

	schema:reviewBody "What a stunning body of work Wes Anderson has created. I will be honest when I first saw the previews to this film I was worried that Anderson may have gone the way of so many other directors who have developed their name in Hollywood. Art is replaced by money which is replaced by angry fans. I saw the CGI fish and began to feel a sweat break with nervousness. Will he be able to continue the humor from Bottle Rocket the darkness of Rushmore as well as the ensemble connectedness from The Royal Tennanbaums? Well folks I am here to announce that he has taken the Hollywood money and has not veered too far off his signature course. I always imagine Anderson's work as a very dry martini. His humor the most intelligent work I have seen in a long time is like the liquid itself creating this bold texture while packing a powerful emotional punch. The olives are the cast giving just some extra to nibble on while you enjoy the entire drink. Place these elements together the drink and olives and you have The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.To begin with this film would not have worked without anyone else in the lead than Bill Murray. His ability to contain himself while also giving us the emotional stress of being a firsttime dad as well as loosing his best friend is Oscar worthy. He is the perfect guide for our trip giving us that knowledgeable laugh as well as those sympathetic eyes that seem to shout Everything will work out. He is bold and smooth as both the Captain of the vessel as well as learning the tricks of being a father. His ability to deliver his lines was both crucial and beautifully timed giving us just enough to make us fall in love with him by the end of the film. Coupled with his amazing performances is the work of everyone else involved. Willem Dafoe proves that he can handle any role big or small and make it very memorable. My favorite character during this voyage was Cate Blanchett's role that nearly stole the show from Murray. Her multidepth character gave us just the distraction that we needed to see the power of the fatherson relationship. Her quirks take us deep into the human soul and give us a mother's perspective to this mission. It is a beautiful counter to Murray's passiveaggressive father figure. Goldblum is quickly becoming a favorite actor of mine while Huston proves that she still has the ability inside of her. Both of these guys need to see more work. The rest of the eclectic cast ranges from the hilarious interns to the melancholy songs of David Bowie see if you can spot them!. Even Noah Taylor of Vanilla Sky fame turned out a stunning performance. The cast shines through beautifully playing off each other giving us some of the best performances of the year.I will admit Anderson's comic narrative will leave this dry taste in your mouth but for me it was a great experience. His humor is dry his films are dry but that is what makes him different than others in his field. He gives us those long pauses and obscure references that will either force you to think or create frustration because you do not understand his meaning. I have grown up on his films since seeing Bottle Rocket and I love the way this man creates. One of my favorite lines and scenes in this film that I have raved to everyone as the epitome of an Anderson film was when Zissou first takes Ned to the island and Eleanor tells Steve that one of his cats died. After some banter Ned asks what type of cat it was. Zissou replies Who cares. A tabby I think which isn't funny at first but then you realize that all he has on the island are Siamese cats which only make me laugh harder in my seat. That is Wes Anderson humor and it works perfectly for me. His ability to create these challenging characters and put them in situations that I never saw coming the pirates scene being one of them was outstanding. It felt as if he was throwing his crew into different troubles daily who in turn produced some of the best work ever. Only Wes Anderson could create beauty out of chaos.My fear of the CGI was muted immediately when I saw that Anderson used the technique to create some of the most imaginative creatures ever to lurk in the sea impressed me. He didn't use it as a central focus of the film until the end and used it sporadically so that it really didn't feel as if it was being used. The creatures that he created are so bold and colorful that skillfully he uses them to counter the life of Zissou which seems be getting darker by the day. This contrast allowed me to see deeper into Murray's character and root for his misadventures throughout the entire film.Overall I was very impressed. I know that not many enjoyed this picture as much as his previous works but for me it was a fresh chapter with a stellar cast. Anderson is slowly changing the face of cinema and soon others will follow trying to recreate his award winning voice but will not succeed. This man is in the same boat as Gondry Coppola Jonez and Kaufman. These are the imaginative thinkers of Hollywood that continually break the mold and open the doors to new possibilities.Grade  out of ".

Oh I love that movie now I know why I felt so sentimental when I watched that movie first time  it reminds me my childhood so so much. Our gang had secret plan  to get big boat somewhere load it with food guns and go to Cuba. We didn't have scientific dreams  I am sure that in this movie Wes Anderson tries to picture his adventurous dreams when he was small. Now I understand why there is an old man asking for signature of child's scifi books why there is a letter from small boy why Cate Blanchett is saying at the end of the movie he will be twelve in eleven and half and Steve responds that's my favorite age. That was my favorite age too Steve... I take this movies as a wonderful tribute to childhood mostly boyish I guess where great adventure was all around us. Do not get me wrong I did not discover this idea I was told about it and for me it perfectly fits together and I love this movie even more!By the way very similar movie tricks made Czech director Karel Zeman 40 years ago in BW.

	schema:headline " Brilliant unpretentious charming";
	schema:reviewBody "Well exactly as my summary says this is a very well made straightout unpretentious movie about a fading wildlifefilm director's attempt to recreate his past success that made him some sort of cult phenomenon. Reading a few of the other reviews I think this is evidently a hate it or love it film however a lot of people seem to have missed the pointI don't think this film was really intended as a comdey to me it was more just about the relationships and interactions between the various characters and maybe even an exploration of the human spirit.The motivation for this project is revenge on the leopard shark that killed his best friendlongstanding partner and there is a lot of emotion on the way including an inspiring relationship between him and his long lost son whom he has never met but was a huge fan of his as a boy and the constant drama between him and his wife who's father's money has payed for his entire career.Wes Anderson has excellent cinematography with some great CGI depicting marine life in a very retro fashion and beautiful landscapes as well as a very well puttogether soundtrack including Sigur Ros The Stooges and Ziggy Stardust era Bowie played in Portuguese with a classical guitar accompaniment. We also see Bill Murray at his best as well as a heartwarming performance by Owen Wilson who I am not normally a fan of. The script is also very well written and the story is so well puttogether that even an attack by pirates or looting a large scientific institution seem plausible in a serious movie about an oceanographer! Overall this is a brilliant film and there isn't a lot more I can say.".

	schema:reviewBody "I find this a hard movie to rate. Maybe a second viewing would make it easier. It's a odd film one of these lowkey black humor films which is a mixture of drama and comedy. What set this apart were a few other shocking scenes of violence something not normally in this type of movie. For a comedy albeit a tongueincheek one that violence doesn't seem to fit but it makes the film all the more intriguing.At times I was totally bored with this movie and at other times fascinated. I know one thing this is a bizarre story! That automatically means it's a good vehicle for Bill Murray who excels at wacky characters event he lowkey ones as he sometimes plays i.e. Lost In Translation The Royal Tenebaums etc.. Speaker of the latter this movie was written and directed by Wes Anderson the same man who did Tenenbaums. If you saw that you have an idea of what you might get here although I thought Royal Tenenbaums was far funnier.At 118 minutes this a bit long for what it offers. I'd like to have seen it 15 minutes shorter with a tighter script. But it does offer some good photography in addition to the strange story. This movie as they say is not for all tastes.".

The soundtrack is amazing also both the Seu Jorge sp? tracks and the Devo instrumentals.

It took me to get to the end of the movie to realize it.This is essentially a remake of Fellini's 8 12 perhaps done as outright farce and with a touch of farcical brutality. 8 12's Guido has and resolves his crisis in the process of making a single movie but we meet Zissou in the midst of a slowmotion train wreck crisis spanning the prior 10to15 years of his career really a life in the midst of being completely botched. Ouch. And there are other bumps and bruises along the way such as the bit of seemingly opportunistic shadow sparing with Ned's life and character.It's cool You are borne along by the barrage of postmodern yucks and rewarded at the end by a wonderfuland wonderfully challengingmythic payload Are you ready to face your mortality as did Zissou? Will you succeed? I think the film tries to offer a hope to those of us who may sometimes feel as lost as Zissou he made it and so can we. We're not hallucinating and the Leopard Shark awaits us. Sure it's deadly and dangerous but it's also beautiful and we just have to buck up and look into its maw. And the rewards of doing so are very very real.By the way a clue that the filmmakers had Fellini in mind is the staircase scene at the end. I mean it could just be a case of both films tapping the same archetype but somehow I doubt it.Enjoy! Your life that is!".

The score was spectacular mixing Bowies actual recordings with the Portugese covers of Sue Jorge was ingenious. In my opinion the story bares some resemblance to that of Moby Dick in that the main character is the Capitan of a ship and is bent on finding a sea creature for at first revenge... but draw your own comparisons.All in all the movie was stellar and grabbed my attention from beginning to end although it is definitely one of those films that you either like or dislike and i obviously liked it. I recommend seeing it even if your friends say that its bad i only rented it in the first place because it was all they had at Video Connection one lonely Friday night and i needed something to watch and all of my friends none of whom know what their talking about trashed it never the less i found it beautiful hilarious and overall an absolutely stunning work of art by Mr. Wes Anderson... also if you saw it and liked it you should check out the Royal Tenenbaums also directed by Anderson it is almost as good as the Life Aquatic.".

Various family problems issues surface and are worked out or not. No one really interacts with any depth it's as if they're each in a separate bubble that slightly rubs against other bubbles. There's no chemistry depth feeling character development consistency.Anderson's defenders no doubt love this quirky feel as it's so like real families who don't actually interact.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not generally a fan of Wes Anderson. He relies too heavily on the charm of detachment. Burton has this problem too hidden under the humorous tone. The appeal is a generational thing and I guess I'm too old to simply find that enough. But here he does something different than what I have seen elsewhere from him. I think it is because the Owen influence is small here. The form is a movie about making a life which is a movie. Both the movie and the movie within have fantastic elements but we do have a clear shift to brighter colors and crisper landscapes when within the inner world.Its all based on synthetic notions of drama love purpose worth. When you sneak up on things this way you have to play a delicate game one I think Wes usually flubs. You have to engage by setting a distance that is far enough from the norm that we as viewers can lean into it and near enough to what we think of as real flesh that we want to. Bill Murray doesn't understand this balance because he's all about distance. Never mind he's just an actor. So you select actors that try for the closeness. Dafoe and Blanchett get this. What they choose to do is simple they form a real person and layer some cartoonish mannerisms on top. We see through the play and value the real underneath where we cannot with Murray and Wilson. Because the whole thing can blend together we get a wonderful balance of this tension engagement and studied apartness. I credit Anderson with maintaining this container. It works. And it works because he was smart. You can see that he understands this dynamic well enough to know that we will be impatient with his tricks for very long. So the movie changes tone as it moves along. It changes slowly with less emphasis on the personal abstraction and more on abstracting the physical the ship the rooms beds sub. It allows Cate to present her womb which is quite a miracle.If you read the trivia at IMDb you find that many top actresses wanted this part. So it is pretty amazing that Cate's condition as a pregnant woman who knows how to turn herself inside out was able to have that condition become so central to the world we see.This isn't quirky. This isn't comedy. This is extremely sensitive positioning of the audience to allow for deeper penetration. Its a triangulation of Incident at Loch Ness and Cowards Bend the Knee .I felt blessed watching it.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

Bill Murray's character Zissou is an empty shell of a person who really doesn't care about anything not even money or greed like Royal Tannenbaum. It is hard for me to see any resemblance to film maker Cousteau. Most of the characters are as onesided as paper dolls. Owen Wilson's Ned is the only one who seems to have any blood pulsing through his veins. Basically this movie is a vapid cartoon.Actual aquatic life is wonderful. Why does this movie want to adorn fish with finger paints and rhinestones ? How depressing !!!".

The actors do a good job but its the actualization of the story or lack of that makes this film a complete disappointment. The many downsides to this film are that the plot struggles with pacing problems in that the slow parts are strangely interrupted with action that seems to come out of nowhere and vice versa. Therefore the story becomes sporadic and at times sluggish. There are many quirks that develop within and between the characters that are never fully explained or carried out to any sort of conclusion. The story itself has many subplots that go on unexplained ultimately losing the audience. In the end nothing is gained or realized to the potential in which it could have been. And the usage of a Sigur Ros song towards the end of the film is extremely out of place. In conclusion Life Aquatic is Wes Anderson being TOO Wes Anderson. His trademark humor is almost too obvious and blatant. This film had so much potential but it was all squandered away in its pitfalls. Anderson should stick to writing with Owen Wilson that really seemed to work. I am a big fan of Bottle Rocket Rushmore and Royal Tenenbaums but The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou completely falls short of my expectations.".

What it has is Bill Murray and Owen Wilson teaming up with Wes Anderson to portray a wonderful story. To like any of those three involved is to like this film. Definitely worth 2 hours out of any life unless you'll be dying in less than 2 hours. This movie signifies the new way of storytelling for movies to come for years. The days of the oldfashioned drama starring a powerful actor supported by wonderful character actors is over. To be a good movie anymore the lead must have the capability to play more than himself in real life i.e. Bruce Willis is always Bruce Willis. Bill Murray fits the mold perfectly as he portrays the washedup sea adventurer. Not to mention the wonderful cast around him the best performance coming possibly from Willem Dafoe who is great in every movie he's in.".

And that's not a stretch the film was ridiculously funny. The audience completely ate it up. The film is a selfparody of the Japanese from beginning to end Soichi dreams of making 'trendy' jpop wearing 'trendy' clothes and living in a 'trendy' apartment. It's like watching the Japanese hold a mirror up to themselves and mocking every detail. Watching Soichi try to reconcile his 'true' wannabe pop star self with his newly acquired and undesired status as death metal god is priceless. He spends his nights dressed as a 'demon' singing songs about rape and murder the film mocks heavy metal in such a comical and respectable way that even serious metal fans can't help but roll with laughter and his days on street corners singing sweetsounding pop songs about love and um rainbows. Katsuyama had fantastic comic timing as Soichi and completely won over the audience. It was a hoot to watch him totally commit himself to his metal persona while on stage but being completely miserable and lovelorn the girl he likes hates metal and knows nothing of his metal persona after taking his makeup off. His two sides are completely different and you wonder if he'll ever just embrace his metal god status and give up his pop star dream. Of course that's the journey the director wants to take us on. And it is one hell of a ride.Some films are so ridiculous that it's just nonsense. DMC manages to be ridiculous and sublime at the same time. The film is a guaranteed good time and I can't imagine anyone watching it without a huge grin on their face afterward.".

In real life he's a complete innocent vaguely reminiscent of a young Jerry Lewis but when he's in the rock band Detroit Metal City he transforms into the personification of the misogynistic sociopathic rock star. I've always found Japanese humour as rather broad and this is no exception here except it entirely works in this movie. Ken'ichi Matsuyama apparently a star in Japan who sends girls into fits of screaming does an excellent job here and is entirely convincing either as the innocent young man or as the rock star. In fact he is achingly hilarious when he's singing the trendy music that he loves. There are several moments that will have you convulsed but I don't wish to give anything away by describing specific scenes except to say that it's the humour that pushes the movie past the level of the ordinary.However despite being a comedy the film is completely faithful to the spirit of heavy metal music. This is not Spinal Tap. Unlike Spinal the music in this movie sounds convincing and very much like good rock music. Whenever it comes out on DVD you'll want to turn up the subwoofer!I saw this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival and the crowd I saw it with was very receptive despite likely not being the target audience for the film. Even the director before the movie said that it premiered the previous night to a very enthusiastic crowd and he joked that he hoped we'd liked it since we seemed so much older. That got a big laugh but I still was surprised to see so many people past middle age who clearly enjoyed this movie. It was almost certainly the humour and the likability of Matsuyama and the entire cast that was the responsible.This feels like something that almost has to be remade by Hollywood. However you should try to see this version first before any watereddown North American version hits the screens.".

The sheer atmosphere in the cinema would have multiplied the enjoyment manifold.Both meanings of the word simple are intended in my summary line. First the plot line is reduced to bare necessities. An innocent country boy Soichi Negichi goes to Tokyo for university ends up being the lead singer of a heavy metal death band. The irony is that his passion is for saccharinsweet love ballads which he writes and sings at street corners very often to a lone audience of a little dog that is when he is not in his alter ego Johannes Krauser II garbed in grotesque costume complete with long wig and a face painted deathwhite. Secondly this JekyllandHyde protagonist is portrayed by Keniche Matsuyama with exaggerated idiocy facial expression as well as body language and it works. Negichi becomes instantly lovable and that goes a long way in gaining the audience's acceptance of the movie even those not in the targeted age group as one comment points out.The identity charade is exploited to the fullest in this movie and successfully so. Those who have read the immensely popular manga also vouch for the movie's authenticity. You just can't praise enough Matsuyama's superb performance. And one does not have to be a heavy metal fan to be swept along by the exciting finale of a musical duel between Soichi and the reigning global heavy metal king Jack II Dark played lovingly by Gene Simmons of KISS after which DMC is modelled.There is no need to philosophize the purported probe into the duality human nature or the universality of music. DMC is a movie to be enjoyed and simple does it.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Detroit Metal City";
	schema:reviewBody "And I felt the filmmakers nailed it squarely on the head with the casting of Ken'ichi Matsuyama more famously known these days as the teen detective L from the Death Note series. In that film he had disappeared behind a stoic and serious demeanour behind a lithe frame being quite fleetfooted while snacking on sweet food. Here Ken'ichi again disappears and in more challenging terms being on opposite sides of the spectrum from the meek to the flamboyant and if you're not impressed by his L his turns here would impress as being a consummate character actor capable of fleshing out characters very convincingly. If it's a chameleon actor you're looking for look no further than Matsuyama.As Negishi his mushroom cut hairstyle sported fits the character to a tee. A mild mannered sissy nerd he shuffles his feet from his hometown village to the bright city of Tokyo in the hope of fulfilling his dream of being a trendy pop singer. You know the one who belts out bubblegum pop tunes about first love and sweet kisses. He lives by the mantra of No Music No Dream and inspires his fellow peers to do the same and seize the day. Just so to tell you he's still a straight character despite his effeminate ways he's attracted to Aikawa Rosa Kato who resembles a little like Aoi Miyazaki who's starring in yet another similar music based movie in Shonen Merikensack which I am looking forward to. Who wouldn't?But an unexpected opportunity to join a band he soon finds himself manipulated by his female boss Yasuko Matsuyuki into becoming the frontman for the heavy metal band Detroit Metal City DMC as Johannes Krauser the long haired pale skinned singer from the depths of hell who sings raged filled songs and preaches satanism hate anger murder and rape. He garners a countrywide following filled with rabid groupies and is more wildly successful as part of the engineered metal band than trying to strike out on his own as a frivolous pop singer that's a dime a dozen.It's an excellent contrast of characters but more so an examination of self and the personas we adopt in different situations. It might even be a classic case of Schizophrenia for Negishi because as Krauser he's really good at what he does and almost comes second nature as that sissy man who had found an avenue to unleash his pent up frustration and hit back at the whole world and get adored for that as well. Cursing and swearing comes second nature and he can get really confused at times if his interests got mixed  romancing his lady love who abhors metal music and satisfying his legion of fans with a public appearance. Unlike the Incredible Hulk within whom Bruce Banner disappears it's interesting here because Negishi has full conscious control over Krauser but allows himself to cut loose and live up to that masked persona even if it means having to embarrass the woman he loves.It's about striking a balance between living your dream and being practical about it. As Krauser he inspires others into living theirs even though he doesn't exactly get to do the same. But only because he does what he does best even though he doesn't exactly subscribe to it. He commands his unwavering fans for whom he inspires though in some negative ways but what better than to express one's rage through music and at the concert venues only rather than to hit back in society  we don't see any of the metal fans causing trouble and the amount of clout one has in influencing his followers to live for the better. It's this realization and awakening that Negishi understands his calling in life that he cannot live a life that's for selfish personal interest in throwing away Krauser just so he can pursue his love over that of the benefit for the masses and those who adore him.It's like a superhero story of sorts as well where the hero disappears into his sanctuary by having an alterego within which he can operate normally without the pressures of expectations. We become somebody else very easily when we have ourselves hidden behind a costume incognito and can carry out feats which we normally wouldn't do for fear of identity repercussions and of course shame if something goes wrong. The white face makeup is Negishi's secret formula in transformation from geek to devil without fear of his family discovering his secret he tells them he works at a floral shop and disappointed his parents that he's a preacher for hate in direct contradiction to the gentlemanly ways he's brought up in.But of course like any other movie this one is not perfect. There were a number of scenes that were played out purely for laughs but sometimes fell flat on its face for its repetitive nature. Such as having his boss from hell come trash Negishi's pastel coloured apartment just so that she could awaken the devil in him permanently and provide for some misunderstanding between Negishi and Aikawa. Or that inexplicable scene of running with his legion of fans for miles before reaching a concert venue. One could actually tell Ken'ichi Matsuyama was panting under that thick makeup and heavy costume.To no surprise DMC attracted more female fans than the male ones in the screening I attended despite having metal music blaring that degrades the female of the species so that can only attest to the magnetism that Ken'ichi has over his fans. It isn't exactly about metal music nor is it about the comedy here but it's about self and the masks we all wear. For that this comes definitely recommended in the dilemmas that we lead our lives under from time to time.".

I was shocked when Gene Simmons appeared on this and was doing a face off to Soichis metal self. Man he really crashed the house down here it was just really well done! I may not mind any genre but the rape mentions were really uncomfortable to listen to. I wouldn't suggest watching this film if you are highly sensitive towards rape mentions especially in most of the rock hardcore songs thats played in this film. Regardless of that I did find the movie enjoyable including the music. Especially if it was stupid and had serious mentionings on this. I'll give it a 810".

Me and my fianc both agreed that the funniest bit throughout the whole movie was the relationship between Reynolds character and his brother. The slapfights were great and the one moment of brotherly love was simply hilarious. If you're tired of the raunchy humor of the likes of 40Year Old Virgin and want a good movie for a date or just as a stand alone movie this one is great. It's got so many things in it that make it wonderful Tasteful witty humor good plot puts you in the Christmas spirit but also works as a nonseasonal movie and gives props to any guy who's been put in the Friendzone. My fianc came out of the movie and said That makes me feel bad about all the guys I've told them I 'just want to be friends'. So there you go guysif you got a girl you're crushing on and you think you might be in the Friendzone with her take her to this movie even if it's just a friendly date. It may break the ice and she could see what kind of girl she's being.

	schema:headline " A Good Holiday Romantic Comedy with likable characters and a decent amount of laughs.";
	schema:reviewBody "Just Friends is about a guy named Chris Ryan Reynolds who in high school was an overweight but caring sweet and likable guy. Chris wanted to date his best friend Jamie Amy Smart but they never did because she wanted to just be friends and date the cool guys. Ten years later Chris sheds all his weight and is now a big time record producer touring with the hottest pop star Samantha James Anna Faris. While on their plane to Paris Chris and Samantha's plane has to make an emergency landing and the plane lands near Chris's old home town. To make matters worst Chris winds up going into the bar where he runs into his old crush Jamie. So does Chris have what it takes for Jamie and him to be more than just friends? Just Friends is not a great movie by any means but a likable romantic comedy. Sure the movie is predictable but it's a fun and ultimately sweet movie. I actually like the fact that the movie had a nice message in the end which basically said be yourself and it will pay off in the end. The jokes for the most part worked for me because they were all pretty innocent and didn't really rely on sex gags to sell the movie.I did however get annoyed by the amount of gay jokes in the film which like I always say are never really that funny and get old very fast. I understand as much as I rant about gay jokes there not going to stop but let's hope that they can be limited. There is only one gay joke in the entire film that works while there are about 10 in the entire film.As far as acting goes I must say it's about time that Ryan Reynolds stars in a decent movie!!! I have been waiting for years to actually go into a theater and see something of his that doesn't totally suck! You see I always wanted to like him but most of the material he has done just didn't appeal to me and every time I saw a movie he was in I hated it with a passion. I think this role worked for him because he had to play a likable character and while many will say he always plays a likable character I say that he always plays the same sarcastic cool guy character. This role allowed him to still be his normal character for some part but also a likable character as well. Mr. Reynolds has finally gotten out of his box and played a role that wasn't tailor made for him.As for the rest of the cast Amy Smart was also very likable as the best friend Jamie. She was honestly a very sweet and caring person and you really wanted her to date Chris at least in the beginning. Anna Faris who again plays the same character in every movie did play her typical airhead role. But she played a stereotypical brainless pop star and played it perfectly. And while I must admit I do like pop music I found her whole performance hilarious. She basically played Jessica Simpson in the movie and there are a few jokes that really imply that's who they were mocking.The reason I think I actually enjoyed this film was that I could relate to the characters. The main character Chris was like a few people in high school including myself a really nice guy who was friends with a lot of very pretty girls but never moved past that point because of their image or how they were perceived in school wouldn't allow them to be more than just friends. And while the movie doesn't really seem realistic it is made by Hollywood which at times gives people a chance to believe that the underdog will come out on top. Just Friends isn't going for a Best Picture nomination or even trying to be original but it does a decent job of what its suppose to do and that is provide jokes and some romance which the film does and does it very well.All in all Just Friends is a guilty pleasure film. It's not one that will do well at box office or be liked by everyone most critics gave it rather poor reviews but I don't think it was a film created for critics but a specific limited audience. And while the film's marketing makes this film look like a typical teen movie I feel it's a bit more mature than that even though some of the characters in the film are almost childlike. Overall Just Friends shows how important it is to be yourself and act mature. It is also proof that Ryan Reynolds can play a different character and is actually good at it. As long as you don't go into the theater expecting a film that is original and thoughtprovoking you should be fine because this movie is a decent holiday romantic comedy that both guys and girls alike can enjoy.MovieManMenzel's final rating for Just Friends is a 710 and it will be added to my guilty pleasure section of my DVD collection when it is released on DVD in a few months.".

	onyx:emotionText "Just Friends is about a guy named Chris Ryan Reynolds who in high school was an overweight but caring sweet and likable guy. Chris wanted to date his best friend Jamie Amy Smart but they never did because she wanted to just be friends and date the cool guys. Ten years later Chris sheds all his weight and is now a big time record producer touring with the hottest pop star Samantha James Anna Faris. While on their plane to Paris Chris and Samantha's plane has to make an emergency landing and the plane lands near Chris's old home town. To make matters worst Chris winds up going into the bar where he runs into his old crush Jamie. So does Chris have what it takes for Jamie and him to be more than just friends? Just Friends is not a great movie by any means but a likable romantic comedy. Sure the movie is predictable but it's a fun and ultimately sweet movie. I actually like the fact that the movie had a nice message in the end which basically said be yourself and it will pay off in the end. The jokes for the most part worked for me because they were all pretty innocent and didn't really rely on sex gags to sell the movie.I did however get annoyed by the amount of gay jokes in the film which like I always say are never really that funny and get old very fast. I understand as much as I rant about gay jokes there not going to stop but let's hope that they can be limited. There is only one gay joke in the entire film that works while there are about 10 in the entire film.As far as acting goes I must say it's about time that Ryan Reynolds stars in a decent movie!!! I have been waiting for years to actually go into a theater and see something of his that doesn't totally suck! You see I always wanted to like him but most of the material he has done just didn't appeal to me and every time I saw a movie he was in I hated it with a passion. I think this role worked for him because he had to play a likable character and while many will say he always plays a likable character I say that he always plays the same sarcastic cool guy character. This role allowed him to still be his normal character for some part but also a likable character as well. Mr. Reynolds has finally gotten out of his box and played a role that wasn't tailor made for him.As for the rest of the cast Amy Smart was also very likable as the best friend Jamie. She was honestly a very sweet and caring person and you really wanted her to date Chris at least in the beginning.

Also the gags were classic and reminded me of National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation which is one of my favorites not to mention being somewhat similar to Van Wilder in its attempt to Woo a woman while having a nemesis in the way of his goal along with Ryan's own personal problems with his past and dealing with his brother his former crazed girlfriend and his out of touch mom just kind of naive to things going on. All in all i found this movie to be a great comedy that i would like to see again at the theaters. Its a classic holiday flick in my opinion.".

It's not the funniest film of the year but it's a nice way to spend 90 minutes. Even though Ryan Reynolds gets top billing for the film Anna Faris is the true star of the movie. She's great as this crazy over the top diva. Too bad she didn't get as much screen time as the other stars. Ryan Reynolds gives good performance nothing special though. Amy Smart was bland and not very interesting. She actually is a talented actress but this role did not suit her and she brought the film down. Her character is very shallow and it's unclear why Chris Ryan would want her. So there's no chemistry between these two this obviously hurts the film. Chris Klein was actually okay which is probably the biggest surprise. Chris Marquette was okay as the younger brother kind of annoying though.The film starts off rather poorly because they show Ryan in that stupid looking fat suit. Luckily the fat suit only appears for the first ten minutes and in a few other short scenes. The first half of the film is pretty good with a nice amount of laughs. Around the middle the film slows down a bit and gets a little dull. The ending is also a little weak because it kind of ruins the story. I don't think they should have gotten together because it shows that she's shallow. I know its just a harmless movie but it kind of ruins the story and the whole just friends thing. In the end Just Friends is a decent comedy that should serve as a solid rental. Rating 610".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie on a flight from Anaheim to Newark NJ. It did not make me want to jump out of the plane rather than continue watching it. It was okay a mildly amusing diversion. There are cute parts and sweet parts and parts that are annoying because they're directed just so heavyhandedly.

Well I am still wondering why I let myself watch this whole movie. It was extremely predictable it was poorly written very unrealistic and just plain bad. Without ruining the scenes or giving away too much you'll just have to take my word for it. After an hour of watching I wanted to go to bed but was actually laughing at how rediculous it was. The scenes which involved Chris going to see Jamie were just pathetic. The way people acted in certain scenes is not how people act in real life. Too many times I found myself scoffing saying what the heck! People do not do that. Accidents that happened in the movie were blown way out of proportion and dumb characters were really overused. It's just a big waste. I am actually mad at myself for losing two hours of my life and two hours of sleep on this piece of trash. This movie is not for intelligent people. It is for dumb teenagers with nothing else to do. I now feel ashamed to admit that I was one of the idiots that watched it.".

	schema:reviewBody "They say that if the music is too loud you're too old. If this also holds for movies then I am so too old. Just Friends comes at you loud and over the top. Subtlety is definitely not director Roger Kumble's strong suit. Nor is wit. Scores of highpitched screams puncture the soundtrack while low frequency sound effects accompany every groin shot and pratfall of which there are plenty.The movie opens in New Jersey with caricatured high school students who are almost as ruthless as the real thing but lack the humanity present in even the jerkiest of real teenagers. The main character Chris Ryan Reynolds is an overweight boy with a retainer and is quite oddlooking costumed as he is for this role in what appears to be Jiminy Glick drag. He is best friends with Jamie Amy Smart the hot ditz who dates the football team yet we are challenged to believe remains unaware of the desires her playful wrestling awakens in forlorn Chris. The rest of the film is a concatenation of cheesy scenes that failed to elicit any audible laughter in the theater I was in.After the painful initial setup ten years pass before we rejoin Chris now a svelte master of the MTV universe living in L.A. The movie conveniently omits any reference to college presumably because that would only alienate its target audience. By now Chris has learned how to use others before or while being used by them certainly a worthy skill on either coast but hardly the transcendence of his own unrequited high school crush and nothing that would make his character sympathetic.The cast performs as if it had barely attended some SNL skit school of acting. Unfortunately for this movie and all who pay to watch it there is a yawning chasm between aimless shtick and comedic character acting  emphasis on yawning. Chris does have a few darned good lines but Reynolds delivers them as if he is too embarrassed to try to salvage something from this tripe.We catch up with buff Chris in time to watch him make it home for Christmas for the first time since graduationpurely by accident in the midst of a most improbable business trip. Its release date notwithstanding Just Friends does not qualify as a Christmas flickit barely qualifies as a flick! Oh yes did I mention that Chris arrives with the country's hottest teen female pop star Samantha James Anna Faris hanging on his arm and poking at his crotch? Faris does a good job of making us cringe at her lack of musical talent while tantalizing more like a terrorist than a temptress. During a foreplay massage Samantha demands more oil with wanton abandonment then abruptly shifts gears with the deflating abruptness of a selfabsorbed brat.The movie ostensibly builds comedy around the serious issue of true happiness. Is real success a mindless career in a faraway city portrayed as a faraway career in a mindless city? Or does success follow from modest homespun joys like those of the girl Chris had desired in high school and who is now a local schoolteacherbarmaid still living at home.Chris decides to extend his emergency layover in New Jersey because Jamie is now impressed with his trim torso and retainershaped smile. He feels he deserves to boink his old buddy to employ the film's vernacular.But our nouveau Kalifornicator has woefully lost touch with his roots and can't seem to hit his stride in the Garden State. Whereas Chris's scourge of yore a crude jock with a mean streak has fallen hopelessly into male pattern beer drinking another scorned suitor from back in the day Dustin Chris Klein appears to be more than a match for our Left Coast professional brownnoser. Dustin has reinvented himself as the ultimate woman pleaser a sensitive stud. His sincerity is the one weapon Chris cannot match until a twist occurs in the story which isn't worthy of the term plot.Two people walked out of the theater during the movie and I would have joined them had I not been there to review the picture. But why did everyone else stay. Who knows? Maybe they were aficionados of fatuity or perhaps they were also movie reviewers.At least after all that noise the picture ends with a whimper. Still I would have felt better about the whole silly business had Chris given Jamie the boot in favor of Samantha's sex and rock scenario of a future together. One broken star.".

He is best friends with Jamie Amy Smart the hot ditz who dates the football team yet we are challenged to believe remains unaware of the desires her playful wrestling awakens in forlorn Chris. The rest of the film is a concatenation of cheesy scenes that failed to elicit any audible laughter in the theater I was in.After the painful initial setup ten years pass before we rejoin Chris now a svelte master of the MTV universe living in L.A. The movie conveniently omits any reference to college presumably because that would only alienate its target audience. By now Chris has learned how to use others before or while being used by them certainly a worthy skill on either coast but hardly the transcendence of his own unrequited high school crush and nothing that would make his character sympathetic.The cast performs as if it had barely attended some SNL skit school of acting. Unfortunately for this movie and all who pay to watch it there is a yawning chasm between aimless shtick and comedic character acting  emphasis on yawning. Chris does have a few darned good lines but Reynolds delivers them as if he is too embarrassed to try to salvage something from this tripe.We catch up with buff Chris in time to watch him make it home for Christmas for the first time since graduationpurely by accident in the midst of a most improbable business trip. Its release date notwithstanding Just Friends does not qualify as a Christmas flickit barely qualifies as a flick! Oh yes did I mention that Chris arrives with the country's hottest teen female pop star Samantha James Anna Faris hanging on his arm and poking at his crotch? Faris does a good job of making us cringe at her lack of musical talent while tantalizing more like a terrorist than a temptress. During a foreplay massage Samantha demands more oil with wanton abandonment then abruptly shifts gears with the deflating abruptness of a selfabsorbed brat.The movie ostensibly builds comedy around the serious issue of true happiness. Is real success a mindless career in a faraway city portrayed as a faraway career in a mindless city? Or does success follow from modest homespun joys like those of the girl Chris had desired in high school and who is now a local schoolteacherbarmaid still living at home.Chris decides to extend his emergency layover in New Jersey because Jamie is now impressed with his trim torso and retainershaped smile. He feels he deserves to boink his old buddy to employ the film's vernacular.But our nouveau Kalifornicator has woefully lost touch with his roots and can't seem to hit his stride in the Garden State. Whereas Chris's scourge of yore a crude jock with a mean streak has fallen hopelessly into male pattern beer drinking another scorned suitor from back in the day Dustin Chris Klein appears to be more than a match for our Left Coast professional brownnoser. Dustin has reinvented himself as the ultimate woman pleaser a sensitive stud. His sincerity is the one weapon Chris cannot match until a twist occurs in the story which isn't worthy of the term plot.Two people walked out of the theater during the movie and I would have joined them had I not been there to review the picture. But why did everyone else stay. Who knows? Maybe they were aficionados of fatuity or perhaps they were also movie reviewers.At least after all that noise the picture ends with a whimper. Still I would have felt better about the whole silly business had Chris given Jamie the boot in favor of Samantha's sex and rock scenario of a future together. One broken star.";

The trio's leader General Zod vowed revenge. Later of course KalEl grew up to become Superman Earth's mighty champion. A battle with the criminal mastermind Lex Luthor ends with Superman hurling a nuclear warhead into space where it explodes but not harmlessly. Instead it frees the Kryptonian threesome from their otherdimensional prison. They soon discover they have almost unlimited power the same powers in fact as Superman which they use to take over the Earth. Meanwhile the intrepid reporter Lois Lane learns that her bumbling colleague Clark Kent is really Superman a revelation that leads to him bringing her to his frozen Fortress of Solitude and renouncing his powers in order to make love to her.

	schema:reviewBody "Richard Donner's cut of Superman II is not the definitive answer to what if Donner had been allowed to finish Superman II? It is not a stand alone completed film so much as it is an abstract representation of where he intended to go. Remember we are dealing with a reconstruction of an incomplete 25 yearold film. It's a jigsaw puzzle with a few pieces missing jimmyrigged with whatever the filmmakers could use to complete it.But if you can look past inherent flaws that comes with the circumstance  obvious dubbing issues inconsistent special effects glaring continuity errors a recycled resolution and lack of an original score  look past all of that look to the underlying vision and you'll see something special.First and foremost the return of Marlon Brando's scenes a presence sorely missed in the theatrical cut of Superman II which allows the characters and story arcs that started in the first film to come full circle. At last nonsensical dialogue from the first film clicks into place  the father becomes the son the son becomes the father  it gains a meaning in a touching exchange between JorEl and KalEl. In the Lester cut KalEl consults his mother in the fortress of solitude and somehow it lacks the emotional punch that the exchange should have. Here though in the Donner Cut Marlon Brando's voice rings with fatherly love and across time and space the essence of the father reaches out to the son. A love that allows JorEl to guide KalEl even from his Kryptonian grave. And after 25 years it finally makes sense how Superman regains his powers after sacrificing them to live with Lois Lane.Marlon Brando as JorEl by itself makes the Donner Cut worth the price of the rental. I mean how do you cut out Marlon Brando? Especially when his character is integral to not only the plot but to the titular character's arc? Anyway I particularly liked the restoration of how Lois initially suspects Clark's identity. A passive comment by Jimmy Olson makes her pause and ponder the paradox of Clark disappearing when Superman appears and she draws a suit hat and glasses over a newsprint picture of the Man of Steel. In the Lester version Lois' eventual revelation feels more chance driven and even when they have direction it's as though they beat around the bush. It's anticlimactic and lacks a fulfilling payoff.In Donner's version by contrast the challenge is more direct. A one on one battle of wits with Lois fighting to conclusively prove that Clark is Superman while he makes clever use of his powers to keep his identity hidden  early on Lois throws herself out a window. And instead of Superman flying to the rescue Clark uses his superbreath to slow her descent and his eye beam to unlatch a canopy to break her fall. She lands safely and lo and behold Clark hasn't moved from the window 50 floors up. Lois! What have you done?! Point Superman and Richard Donner.The exchanges are just more fun in Donner's version  it's like a cat and mouse game that escalates until the eventual pay off in a scene that Donner sadly never shot. Reconstructed from screen tests gaping with continuity errors but it's remarkable the power that still underlines the moment when Clark is finally caught red handed and removes his glasses. Subtly transforming from Kent to Superman right before our eyes  it finally feels like the pivotal moment it should be and resonates more deeply because the previous scenes support and sustain it. I guess what I'm getting at is once again the arc feels more natural more complete.Gone are as many as the throwaway NakedGunesque sight gags as Michael Thau could afford to cut. And what a difference that makes to the overall tone of the movie. Of particular note the battle over Metropolis that finally feels like the epic brawl it should be. Other than a few additions the major difference between Lester and Donner's version lay in the editing. And yet I cheered every time Superman sent one of the villains flying through a building or a sign as though watching this sequence for the first time  I was thrilled when the villains created a powerful wind to stop the mob and the focus stayed on the destruction at hand  cars crashing into buildings and other cars  and not wigs and silly phone booth conversations. The villains are more threatening more intimidating and the battle appears more destructive now that their powers weren't used to generate jokes.While I'm hesitant to say the humor in Donner's film is more sophisticated the Donner cut does have toilet humor not present in the Lester cut I will say Donner's jokes are better planned and executed. At least in his version most of them have proper build up and pay off.Finally the issue of complaints were this another film under another set of circumstances I would have room to complain. It does have flaws yes. As mentioned above the Richard Donner Cut of Superman II looks like a jigsaw puzzle that was finished with whatever. Unlike Superman Donner could not turn back time and finish shooting with the full resources he needed to do the job right. The disclaimer before the film clearly states it's a representation of the Donner concept. Nothing more.Like I said this is only a hint of what could have been. And that's more than we should reasonably have hoped to get.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before you watch this DVD there is something very important that you must understand. Richard Donner never completed Superman II. And since he never completed the film it was impossible to truly make a Donner cut per say. What this DVD edited and produced by Michael Thau shows us is what the film may have looked like. Once you understand that you will be able to enjoy the experience.Why do I go through that explanation? Well...because from the complains I've heard and read it seems that people don't seem to understand that. So that's why I felt it should be addressed.Now on to the review...Donner was hired by the Salkinds in '76 or '77 to direct two Superman films at the same time. When time and money was running out the decision was made to stop production on Superman II and focus on the first one. By that point Donner had already completed about 80 of the film. When Superman became the biggest hit of 1978 the decision by the Salkinds was to fire Donner. He was replaced by Richard Lester A Hard Day's Night and Lester reshot most of the film. Only about 30 of Donner's work remained.After almost 30 years WB finally released Donner's version since most fans demanded to see it. And on the DVD Donner thanks the fans which I felt was a nice touch.The plot of the movie is the same as Lester's Superman II. General Zod and his goons escape the Phantom Zone. They arrive at Earth or Planet Houston as they call it and quickly take over. And where's Superman? He made the mistake of giving up his powers to be with Lois Lane. So will Superman recover his powers on time to save Earth from Zod? You will have to watch the film to find out.Now the question on everyone's mind is whether or not this version is truly better than Lester's take. The answer is yes! Why? Because Lester never really understood the material. Which is prove when you watch Superman III. Donner on the other hand truly understood the material. He understood that...YES...it's a comic book adaptation but it's still an art form. As silly as Superman may seem he understands that there is a wonderful story to tell. And he understands that there is wonderful characters to develop and have an audience understand and fall in love with. When you watch this DVD that's what you'll see. A film directed by a man in love with the material. Not a film by a man who did it for the money. If you love Superman The Movie then you'll love Richard Donner's version of Superman II. The ONLY flaw of this version is that it was never completed.".

	schema:headline " Superman Returns! So Does Brando John Williams Tom Mankiewicz And Of Course Richard Donner!";
	schema:reviewBody "December 1978 and 'Superman The Movie' just premiered worldwide. It's that rare epic that's humorous and fun! It honors the legend and offers a refreshing take on our first encounter with a super flying hero. When the end credits cap with...Next Year Superman II it was met with thunderous cheers and applause. 'Superman The Movie' may not be perfect. But with so much heart and a quality 'tongueincheek' approach that it made for perfect entertainment!Good news the film makers say the best is yet to come with Part 2. Most of it's already in the can. That WAS good news!Unfortunately months later...Bad News strikes! First Director Richard Donner gets nixed!? Some of his scenes are to be replaced?!?Then Marlon Brando Is OUT!! BRANDO?? THE LEGENDARY ACTOR ICON OF THE 50'S AND 70'S! Financial Reasons?. But since he's already been paid his salary his percentage of the gross for Part 2 is contractually guaranteed. His name attached to any movie at that time spells big bucks! And he's essential to the plot!! Go Figure!! But the producers didn't see it that way a similar renege they attempted in their allstar opus The Three... and Four Musketeers in the early 70's. So Brando's out! Brando sues! And Brando wins! He's reimbursed and he's upset!! Wouldn't you be after receiving a couple of mil'?!Most of Donner's scenes are refilmed. Without Donner the heart of the saga is jettisoned. Several actors and crew members are understandably outraged. Even the very professional Christopher Reeve makes a negative statement that it's shameful the world will be deprived of a performance by an actor of Brando's stature.SPOILERS When Superman II was released in 198081 it got great reviews. For me a was a mixed bag! The movie opens on Krypton...and Brando's absence becomes painfully obvious.The music swells! But where's the rich textured motifs that composer John Williams had firmly established from Part 1 less musicians  less money? Themes get carelessly substituted. Even Otis' musical cue continues long after Ned Beatty's early exit. And where's that dramatic epic feel. Proof positive?? Compare Zod's Phantom Zone Release in both the 'Theatrical' and 'Donner Cut' versions. There's no arguing the difference in dramatic impact.And Margot Kidder! Her performance under Lester's direction is heartbreakingly noticeable. Under Donner's direction she's spunky energized spontaneous. And beautiful! Courtesy of Director of Photography Geoffrey Unsworth who's name is finally properly reinstated into the opening titles.A Comic book continuation on a grand scale is forever lost!! So...how does The Donner Cut cut it?? Depends on how much you know on Part II's troubled history and your level of enjoyment of the theatrical version.For me...and I ain't apologizing! It's the most near satisfying movie I've seen this year. Almost like time traveling 25 years back and you're hoping the press made some sort of mistake about Brando not being in it and Donner not directing the little bit left to film and...and whatever! So now Donner's version opens with an ominous score by John Williams followed by a heartfelt tribute! Then! And finally! The 1st voice you now hear is...Brando. You can't help feel that this is the way it should've always been!An alternate universe that most lovers of Superman lore will embrace. The joy ride is in the number of alternate and extended scenes and those crappier ones left out. Is this a definitive version? Of coarse not! Poor decisions canceled out any definitive version from ever existing a long time ago. Non's unnecessary comic schtick is mercifully dusted. The evil Kryptonians are now leaner and meaner. Gone too are the annoying comic spectator reactions to the battle of the titans.Top billed Gene Hackman's limited screen time nearly doubles and you can't help wonder why they got cut to begin with. His standin double and silly voiceover one liners by a mimic are minimized. Ned Beatty and Valerie Perrine also get more screen time and I'm probably one of the few who appreciated the flushing payoff.What's baffling is why did all that great footage get originally scrapped? The alternate Lois attempt in the new opening scene to reveal Clark's alter ego is a SCREAM!!! The film's resolution is more poignant if illogical. The main thing is it's different! Why repeat what already exists in the theatrical version when a Donner alternate is available that showcases his original intent. And Lois  Clark are back at their teeny tiny desks along with all the other office riffraff and background mayhem as opposed to Lester's more accurately the producers' costcutting version of Lois secluded into her own office.The awe from 'Superman The Movie' is somehow recaptured. It's obvious from the DVD's documentaries and interviews that Donner loves working with actors. From the cast interviews it's obvious the affection is mutual. On screen it obviously shows! Donner should be commended for his courage on revisiting this painful period in his past. This is a new and exciting vision with a whole different feel. Also I doubt he could maintain a dry eye whenever Christopher Reeve was on screen.This is a must see and a 1st in movie history! Never before has an internet campaign been so successful in making an impossible dream became possible.The legacy of Christopher Reeve  Marlon Brando demands that their 'lost' footage be celebrated. Their solo scene where they 'connect' is worth the price of admission. It's unavoidable that fan's opinions will split! Which version is better? You decide! I don't have the arrogance to state which is better. I can only say which version I enjoyed more.And there's no way to conclude a 'Superman II' review without saluting Michael Thau.".

I got the DVD yesterday and expected a film with missing holes missing scene title cards and uneasy editing due to the footage used. What people forget is that Richard Lester's version was pretty hot in 1980 minus a bloke getting blown around while on the phone in the heat of a battle. Well ... I was shocked and I clapped at the end. Superman II now feels like a different film. The new scenes are very good and just show what Chris Reeve could do  what a wonderful actor he really was Marlon Brando scenes are superb to watch new music cues  from Superman one lots of new funny scenes and new special effects that don't look out of date in what is supposed to be a 1980 film. Gene Hackman's part seems more fleshed out here than before  witness the Fortress of Solitude crystal scenes. lovely and funny. This shows the power of DVD and show special it is. This cut simply could not have been made. You will find that some of the new edits jump from scene to scene in a flash  that because we already know the film from Richard Lester's version. Watch this like is was new and you would love it more. You if you are a Superman fan will fall in love with the new opening scene with a new look at the Phantom zone capture new camera angles you see and get this  new credit sequence up to the standard of the original supe adventure. So it really like a fantastic new look at a old film. You could point out the faults in lines dubbed or the odd bit of tinkering even the ending but this really is a new Chris Reeve film you though could never have been made. Bonus. Masterful piece of reimaging  Superman is back Lee".

	schema:reviewBody "Most movie fans know that Richard Donner began shooting Superman III simultaneously and that he was fired after the first was completed to be replaced by Richard Lester. Lester reshot most of Donner's footage reworking scenes and dialogue and finishing the second film as well as time budget and his own talents allowed.Compared to the first it was badly paced choppily edited and filled with horribly out of place attempts at comedy. Superman's showdown with Zod and his henchmen in downtown Metropolis was still and in many ways is still the greatest superhero battle ever captured on film but the rest of the film was weak and uneven in comparison. The result was an entertaining enough followup but one was until now left to wonder what might have been had Donner had the opportunity to finish the film properly.In an unprecedented move Warner Bros. recently allowed Donner to remaster and edit all of his original Superman II footage. Most of the footage had survived and some parts had to be filled in with segments from Donner's reshoots and even a couple of full dress screen tests.The result is while a bit rough around a couple of edges remarkable. The new version is paced much better and gone are the more cringeinducing moments from the theatrical cut like Superman's amnesia kiss or Clark's bumbling around like a buffoon and falling into a fireplace. More importantly however is the dramatic weight that some of the restored scenes add to the film. A wonderful fatherson dynamic is revealed as Superman and Jorel Marlon Brando appearing in previously unseen footage find themselves at odds over the last son of Krypton's proper role on Earth. In the theatrical cut when a depowered Clark returns to the fortress of solitude in a quest to regain his powers he finds the glowing green crystalline equivalent of a Get Out of Jail Free card. In The Donner Cut Superman's powers are not restored without a price.If you haven't seen The Donner Cut you haven't seen Reeve's finest acting as the son of Jor El. We also get more Gene Hackman and the delightful Valerie Perrine.The action scenes are as punchy as as ever and again campier comedic elements have been removed. The new ending will definitely divide audiences. I won't spoil it here but it certainly is different and I'm not quite sure how I feel about it yet.Here's hoping that in the future the Man of Steel's cinematic exploits continue to be steered by class directors such as Richard Donner rather than hacks such as Sidney J. Furie or Richard Lester.".

There is material in the Richard Lester version that has been airing in the UK for years that i love and when you see the Donner cut its either edited out or the music is completely changed! The scenes i'am talking about are really around the Krypton villains. Their arrival on the moon and attack on the astronauts was one of the best sequences in the movie and the villains' theme by Ken Thorne originally by John Williams which plays over that sequence and whenever they are on screen was fantastic...the soundtrack is not in that sequence in the Donner cut!Also the hand wrestling scene between the farmer and Ursa in the coffee shop is gone! Please don't get me wrong this version is superb and i guess it is as close to seeing what Richard Donner originally intended for the sequel before he was replaced with Richard Lester. Also the 'new' footage which i have never seen is really great especially the opening sequence with Lois Lane throwing herself out of the Daily Planet office window in an attempt to get Superman to save her as is the small new inclusions of the attack on the White House making it a little longer and more violent was the right direction and you can clearly see where the makers of the X Men got their inspiration from in this sequence.The final battle at Superman's address in the North Pole is slightly disappointing. More a battle of super minds than super powers.However this is really fascinating if you are a Superman fan and thankfully because of the box set i now have both versions. One is not better than the other they are both flawed brilliance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Superman II was Superman Trouble. I will spare the sordid details as they can be read in my Superman II review on the Lester version boards. But let's just say that if you really want something bad enough it can and might happen. Such is the case with this new and most say REAL version of Superman II. After many years and even more letters Warner Brothers finally financed a Donner recut of Superman II. But as has been stated before  the two films are both incomplete and one will never actually see what Donner's version will ever really be. However with this new cut we as an audience can finally see what Donner had intended and conceived.Superman II begins with sparing no expense or exposition. We see the action start right away with such rumored scenes as Lois jumping out of the window longer Lex Luthor prison scenes and finally the scenes with Marlon Brando which were long thought a rumor. Also seen are the full fortress finale the full Donner interiors to the Daily Planet and the screen tests for both Reeve and Kidder that were ingeniously edited together to create a scene in itself. These are great new scenes with the soft Geoffrey Unsworth lighting John Barry production design and gorgeous Margot Kidder and of course Donner direction that give off the feel that the first film had. The print really shines and the Donner footage is exactly what fans had hoped for.The writing is better too better dialog better pacing and no Lester humor. The Metroplois battle is harsher the way Lois finds out Superman's identity is more clever you can see why Margot was cast her screen test intercut with Reeve's plays well as an actual scene and the finale is pithy and in your face. It has been years and years coming and I Feel we are now given the Superman II that we wanted.There are a few quibbles. The editing. Michael Thau had some great ideas but he jumps around every take it seems ever shot and never sticks with one. While it is great to see fresh new takes of favorite scenes it is frustrating that some dialog has been lost that was once seen on network television. The editing appears choppy in some scenes as well. We don't get a good enough look at some shots due to this. The Music. It is used rather effective in some scenes better than the Theatrical version and then in some scenes it is not so effective. But these shouldn't really make a difference to the general audiences only to the devotees like me who knew about this version years in advance. Despite those small shortcomings the film will grow on you. I have learned to accept the film editing and musical differences for what they are Donner's intention. Remember the Donner scenes presented theatrically were done so by Lester's crew so everything in this film is how Donner would have done his version. An acquired taste of a new way to look at this classic film. It works. As many of us new it would. It really works.".

So the scene where Lois and Clark go and get a bite to eat and the trucker beats up Clark with a sucker punch to the back of the head yeah that scene. Clark goes back to the diner to beat the guy up even though that first scene never takes place because of Supermans actions in reversing time. The trucker would have no idea why this guy wants to beat him up. So Richard Donner should have left the last scene out entirely. Talk about continuity!!! Other then that the movie was in my opinion not as good as the Richard Lester version. I might be bias because I grew up watching that version. But if you want to see Superman II in a whole new way.

Aside from having a disjointed feel to it the dialog was actually more campy in many places sometimes bordering on silly. The evolution of the LoisSuperman romance is less welldeveloped one of the strengths of the original Superman II and the ending was particularly unsatisfying.

I like this version better because Richard Donner made it a little more serious and the way he wanted it to be. Richard Lester is a good director but he made Superman II more of a comedyromance. I like how they made the footage which has to be about thirty years old look so great like it was brand new. The only tragedy about the movie is that Christopher Reeve and Marlon Brando didn't live to see this film. Now when I see the expanded Superman I always put this one on right after it.

But Lex Luthor Two Time OscarWinnerGene Hackman escapes from prison. He tries to find any new weakness of Superman but Lex decides to team up with these villains are just as powerful as Superman. But these villains are three time more overpowering than Superman.This review is for the Director's Cut which it was originally directed by Richard Donner Conspiracy Theory The Goonies Superman. Which the director was fired when he was nearly done with the film by the producers. Which the producers made many changes for the budget of the movie especially not hiring the late OscarWinnerMarlon Brando for certain key scenes Which Donner already shot for the first picture but deleted it for using those scenes for the sequel. Which Brando was replaced by Susannah York in the Richard Lester Superman 3 A Hard Day's Night The Three Musketeers version. In this new version Donner removes all the footage shot by Lester in the original theatrical release by adding his as it was originally intended in the screenplay. The scenes with Brando are added back in the Lois Lane character plots more designs to unmask Clark Kent as Superman and more.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen 2.351 transfer and an digitally remasteredDolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an introduction by the director an running commentary track by the director and creative consultantTom Mankiewicz a featurette about restoring Donner's cut and deleted scenes. I actually enjoy Donner's cut more than Lester's. Still Lester's version isn't bad since about 60 percent of Lester's cut was shot by Donner. The conclusion of both cuts are different. Donner's cut is actually more personal it is very close to the first Superman film. Donner had a chance to credit as codirector before the theatrical release of Superman 2 but he decline. He felt that the producers and Lester made many changes that they were silly  especially in certain key moments. Donner's cut is actually 12 minutes shorter that Lester's version. Actually it is a matter of personal taste what version you like best. Judge it for yourself. Panavision.  12 out of .".

Kids no longer had to impatiently wait for Superman to appear on screen as in part I. Now as an adult I can see how the mighty had fallen with S2T See my review. I've always heard of the backstory on how they prematurely and unjustifiably fired the original's director Richard Donner from part II. It must have been a rarity back then to film two separate movies simultaneously now it's common 'Back to the Future' and 'Matrix' 2  3 for example. Unfortunately after finally seeing the Richard Donner Cut or S2RD I still can't fully recommend it. Gone was the great Superman change scene the entire Paris rescue as was the wonderful recap of part I in S2T's opening. In fact they all but wrote the words Previously on Superman in S2RD. The special effects weren't great in either Part I or S2T  but S2RD they were mostly downright laughable  such as Lois falling from the Daily Planet window. I will admit some new scenes worked and some they took out were welcomed departures such as any scene in the honeymoon suite. Overall if you grew up on S2T as I did and loved it as a child  not nitpicking as I do as an adult you should absolutely see S2RD as it's almost a brand new childhood experience with dozens of new scenes. Spoiler alert Unfortunately the worst change comes last gone was also the weird amnesia kiss from S2T replaced with the exact same ending as 'I.' This is not only a lazy unoriginal copout it doesn't make sense on why Clark would go back to that diner if those events never actually happened. And will he continue to turn back time for every confrontation?".

	schema:reviewBody "I bought this on BluRay along with the first Superman. I own the films on DVD and laserdisc  and I was pretty hyped to see the Donner cut. As I sit here now I don't know why. It was terrible.More serious? No  not really. The toilet flush in the Fortress of Solitude was 20 times worse than any comedy inserted in the other cut. The loooonnng recap of Superman 1 was unnecessary. When they did Wrath of Khan they didn't first show pieces of the original Trek episode  they just went right on it. A couple of establishing shots were all that was needed. And the first film had it's little funny moments  all of Clark's slapstick and the phone booth scene where it's not a phone booth. Classic. Brando footage ... who cares. Brando frankly always struck me as more of an alcoholic at that point in his career. To be frank when Jorel appears and gives himself up to give Superman his power back  it ruined it for me. He was dead long ago  but now he can walk up and touch Superman? How did he do that? In the original there's the green crystal that begins to glow  and it hearkens to the first film  even as a kid I was able to imagine how it happened  and I was fine with it. To me this was VERY similar to George Lucas deciding to explain the Force in Episode I as midichlorians. Seeing this in Superman II does not explain to me better how he got his power back  it makes it by having a completely illogical occurrence.The scenes at Nigara in this version make next to no sense. The Lois shooting Superman scene had no drama to it. It wasn't poignant  or anything else. It was a lame plot device. Next you know they are flying off to have dinner at the Fortress of solitude where somehow there is chicken and champaign that is really good but we have no idea where that came from. So earlier we get that there must be a bathroom because Miss Tessmarker flushes but then here I have to take it for granted that there is a kitchen to prepare food in. Then they cut to Superman in post coitus. Then they cut immediately to him asking to lose his powers so he can be with her. Honestly without the explanation for why the question is asked  it doesn't make sense. In fact given the way Lois is presented in the film talking about Superman and how once you've seen him in action etc  it's very hard to believe that she would have asked him to do that. If I had never seen the theatrical this whole seen would literally make no sense. The big fight seen was a complete incoherent mess in the Donner cut. I actually suspect Lester simply shot the additions directly from the script  but for the Donner cut because they were not Donner's shots  he cut them. This to me is a key issue  cutting shots because they are not yours as the sole reason doesn't make it good  if it leaves holes which it does here it makes it bad. Should have left in Lester's shots  and removing them simply shows the arrogance of Donner.The original Lester work to me is the single greatest tale of the horror of giving up everything for your own desire  most directly for a man giving up everything to be with a woman. Lois falls in love  Superman falls in love but to be with her  and have children he must become earthly. She says she wants it but when she sees how he's not the same she realizes that was not what she really wanted. All the while some bad people are taking over the planet. At the end of Lester's version there is a great shot of Superman returning the American flag to the White House  and he says to the President that he was sorry he had been away for a while  and that it won't happen again. In this version  it's gone. Instead  we just get the retread of reversing time and then the nonsensical return to the diner to have it out. Oh that's enough. This cut was self indulgent nonsense from a director who passed his prime a long time ago. Donner needs to hit the golf course with Lucas and stay away from making movies anymore.".

It was terrible.More serious? No  not really. The toilet flush in the Fortress of Solitude was 20 times worse than any comedy inserted in the other cut. The loooonnng recap of Superman 1 was unnecessary. When they did Wrath of Khan they didn't first show pieces of the original Trek episode  they just went right on it.

At least if you're going to sell a movie...sell it right without these obvious goofs.Too much was taken out of this movie. Some great additions as I mentioned but more thought should have been put into this. I won't be discarding my original Superman II movie as I probably won't be watching the Richard Donner Cut again.

	schema:reviewBody "This review also contains a very subtle potential spoiler for Superman ReturnsThe Richard Donner version of Superman II cannot be considered a complete film in any way shape or form. Obviously this is because Donner never was able to complete his vision of the film and as a result this is a cobbled together mixture of Donner scenes scenes shot by Richard Lester for the theatrical version of Superman II and even a couple of screen tests edited together to recreate a key scene Donner never filmed.I've heard some people  including actors involved in the film  call the Donner Cut superior to the original. I have to disagree. I liked it well enough but I felt there was too much padding from unnecessary toilet jokes making moot the criticisms that Lester inserted too much inappropriate humor into his version  it is Donner who gives us the spectacle of a flushing toilet in the Fortress of Solitude! to some really slow character moments. The first 45 minutes are rather uneventful and could have used some trimming. Lester's Superman II feels more like a complete film and has some action set pieces that add a level of excitement to the film that after the initial novelty wears off the Donner version admittedly lacks.That's not to say the Donner Cut is a bad film. It has a lot to recommend it more footage of the underrated Sarah Douglas as Ursa for one thing allowing a bit more character development. The relationship between Lois and Clark is established as becoming sexual a bit more clearly than in the Lester version this may be a bit controversial but it works.The real joy in this film is seeing some pretty substantial scenes involving Christopher Reeve and Marlon Brando. There is a subplot about the father becoming the son which was all but eliminated from the Lester version. Here it's given full reign and plays out beautifully in the process providing a strong tie to Superman Returns where the theme resurfaces. Of most note is the one and only scene filmed in which Brando and Reeve appeared in the studio together the scene was later refilmed by Lester with Susannah York instead of Brando. Donner's version also makes more clear the fact that JorEl had created an artificial intelligence program Superman I and the Lester version of Superman II sort of gloss over this. In the Donner cut it's made more explicit which is quite something considering this was filmed in 1978 long before A.I. became a buzzword.The performances in this film are consistent with those of the first Superman film which makes sense since they were shot at the same time. Margot Kidder in particular looks terrific she never looked better even in the simultaneously shot Superman I reportedly she wasn't pleased when Richard Lester took over Superman II and I think you can tell by comparing her performances for Donner with those for Lester.The ending is a problem only if one desires to decanonize the Lester version of the film along with Superman III and IV. The fact the ending is virtually identical to the first Superman film might put some people off. But it is clearly stated on the DVD that Donner would have used a different ending for Superman II had he been allowed to complete the film. So once again we are simply reminded by this and by Chris Reeve's hilariously changing hairstyles in the screen test footage used in lieu of Lester's Niagara Falls secret identity revelation scene that the Richard Donner Cut of Superman II is not intended to be a replacement for the theatrical release  which despite many people disliking Lester's work will remain the definitive version. Instead it is a fascinating and highly recommended piece of what if experimentation which gives a fascinating look at how the production of a major film can result in widely diverging creative ideas.".

	schema:reviewBody "Superman II  The Richard Donner Cut should be a fan's dream come true. At long last footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life. A director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored. It seems like a winning situation. And then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this esoteric dream is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence. While it's entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project. And it is only a very few times.You know things are shaky when the very first bit of text on screen looks like home brew computer graphics. But then we start seeing new footage alternates from Superman  The Movie for the trial and that first bit of hesitation fades away. Hey this is pretty neat! Things are alright for these few fleeting moments until we see footage from STM intermixed with new effects for this project and it doesn't convince at all. And from this point on it never ever lets up. It's probably not right to judge a movie because of bad visual effects but when this is supposedly the direct follow up to a movie whose tag line was You'll Believe A Man Can Fly it's difficult to believe anything shown on screen here. The best effects in this are from the original productions.Another issue with this recut. A lot of it just doesn't make sense. The only reason any of it really works is because we've all seen the theatrical version of Superman II a movie that does make sense. Lester's Superman II fills in the holes of this assembly. Part of this could be because Donner didn't get to complete shooting the other part could be because the makers of this project were intent on using as little Lester material as possible. What we end up with is an assembly of footage that makes Superman IV look airtight and coherent.After viewing this one gets the sense that while Lester was faithful and comfortable using Donner material Michael Thau and his team were extremely disrespectful towards anything filmed by Lester. The best scenes in The Donner Cut are the ones lifted relatively intact from the released version of Superman II. That includes the moon sequence and the diner sequence not ironically both were filmed by Donner. But anything else from that movie filmed by Lester is reedited in such a hasty fashion that it now makes Lester seem like a ham fisted know nothing. While Lester honored the Donner material Lester here is thrown under the bus.So is there anything good in this release? Well Marlon Brando is in it and that's neat to see. In fact watching any of the material shot by Donner is neat since it was all filmed at the same time as Superman  The Movie. But that only highlights the problems of this release. Any of the major scenes really just Lois jumping and scenes with Marlon Brando would have been better served as completed scenes in a deleted scenes section. Instead they are shoe horned into a nonsensical narrative with inferior performances many alternate takes from familiar scenes are used sloppy edits and bad decisions.Watch the opening scene at the Daily Planet. Why are we looking at Jackie Cooper's back as he calls for Lois and Clark? At the end why do we have Lois walking into her dark apartment only to have that followed by Jackie Cooper walking into a dark bathroom turning the lights on? I was initially confused by this because I expected to see Lois. The entire assembly is filled with questionable choices like this.Battle scenes are a mess too with no geography between cuts. It's just random action. Of course the major action scenes were shot by Lester and his material is only used as a bridge to the next set of Donner outtakes or alternates. They should have used more of Lester's footage but probably had too much pride to admit that.The sloppiness extends to the military missile as well. As noted elsewhere the missile shown in The Donner Cut bears the designation XK 10 while we all know it's the XK 101! A blind man in STM knows that! The producers of this assembly who tried so hard to honor the original film dropped the ball less than five minutes in and that mistake is indicative of the quality of the entire production. For all the supposed care that was put into this the final product has an air of shoddiness to it that is inescapable.The entire affair would probably be easier to digest if Warner's didn't make this a separate release here in the states. As it is we're expected to pay for what is essentially a bonus disc of deleted scenes with a Play All option. It's really only worth one viewing so that we can finally see the legendary cut scenes but after that initial viewing I expect that this will be an excellent magnet for dust and little else. I know after my experience of watching this I had new respect for Lester's version. It's by no means perfect but Lester realized the deficiencies that were in the script that stand out here in bold relief. He managed to make a movie that has entertained for many years and will continue to do so while this new recut will most likely only be remembered as a footnote in that films history.".

	schema:headline " The Definitive Superman Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Nearly three decades after its original release here is a radically new version of the near classic sequel Superman II. This version headed up by its original director Richard Donner presents the film the way it was originally intended. The question is does this version live up to both fans expectations and to the version originally released in 1980 by director Richard Lester? The answer is a definite yes.The biggest change in this so version is the addition of 15 minutes of new footage featuring Marlon Brando as Superman's father JorEl. Originally deleted and replaced with similar scenes with Susannah York as Superman's mother these new scenes are radically different in tone. This is mostly due to the Deepings of the relationship between father and son that was seen in the Superman The Movie. The scene were Clark loses his powers is a great example of this. There is genuine tension in the scene between the two characters as the son rebels against the father.But it is the other Brando scene that serves as the best example of this the much awaited repowering scene. Here the love of the father for his son is in seen in a way that is both dazzling and touching. It may also be the single best scene of the Superman franchise. The acting by both Reeve and Brando is amazing and it is a shame that the footage appears now after the death of both actors.But this is just the icing on the cake. Superman II The Richard Donner Cut is full of alternateexpanded scenes. Among these is the escape of the three Krypton villains that is a vast improvement over the Lester version despite some bad CGI Lois jumping out of a window at the Daily Planet after figuring out Clark is Superman a humorous expansion of Luthor's prison escape the scene where Lois forces Clark to reveal he's Superman that is also an improvement over the Lester scene despite being a screentest. Also here are improvements to the final third of the film a much more serious battle over Metropolis a dramatic and actionless confrontation at the Fortress of Solitude the destruction of the Fortress at the hands of Superman and an alternate ending. Surprisingly I found this alternate ending which was originally written for this film and used in the first instead works surprisingly well here and is another improvement over the Lester version.It is worth noting that there is a significant amount of Lester footage in this version due to the fact Donner never had the chance to finish filming the entire movie. But even this footage reedited here seems to also have been improved. Without a lot of the Lester campy humor the footage does not seem out of place.But this film is not perfect of course. The films biggest flaws are in its new CGI effects its sound and its music. The new CGI shot don't really ever match the original footage and at times it is way too obvious the scene where Non goes flying after Superman punches him during the Metropolis battle is a perfect example of this. It is surprising that the original effects out shine those of the original effects of nearly three decades ago.The sound and music is also another issue. The voices don't always match due probably to the age of the recordings. The voices are sometimes different in scenes were dubbing never happened and it is at times obvious. The music reused almost entirely from John Williams score to Superman The Movie works very well. But there are times when it doesn't work and seems out of place. It's a shame that he wasn't brought back to rescore the film. But these problems are not enough to bring down the entire film.Overall Superman II The Richard Donner Cut is the definitive Superman film. When compared to Richard Lester's original version this film outshines and surpasses it. This film was meant to be as it now is the true successor to the classic Superman the Movie and it even surpasses it in terms of sheer quality. This is THE Superman film to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "I believe the greatest mistake was made by the Salkinds by attempting to make two huge movies at the same time. It would have been like making star wars and empire strikes back at the same time. Nevertheless Donner did a hell of Job to try and pull it off and superman the Movie is a classic that I grew up with as a kid. However a lot of Donner's S II footage looks a little tired to me. Lois lane jumping out the window was silly and some of the action fight scenes in metropolis were dreadful. It looks to me as if the Salkinds actually had no choice but to bring in someone fresh to replace a drained Donner struggling to find creative Ideas to complete the project. If Donner was allowed to concentrate on one movie at a time I think S II would have been better than lester's version. On the commentary Donner came across as still being very bitter and he didn't give Lester any credit at all for what were some great scenes that improved the movie no end compared to Donner's. I think Donner was exhausted and frustrated and you could tell that his movie was suffering. That being said it is still a Donner  Lester movie and much of Donner's work makes S II what it is. Both Directors combined made a great film and if Brando's scenes were included in the theatrical version it would be a completed movie where both directors must share the credit. The Salkinds had the money but no movie making sense. We have Lester's Version and Donner's patched up version and now we need the ultimate version with the best of both movies but I'm afraid apart from the Brando scenes and a few others it will mostly be the original theatrical release. Lester deserves more credit for injecting some fresh direction into a movie that we can now see was struggling.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't blame Donner for wanting to put together a cut of this film with as much of the footage he shot as possible but the result is a rather dull waytooserious mess that is illogical to boot. It was interesting to see the new scenes but if this was the version released in theaters in 1980 the film would not have been the success it was.I thought Lois's suspicions of Clark being Superman were played out much better in the original. In the new one she draws glasses on a newspaper image of Supes and is suddenly so convinced that she leaps out of the skyscraper a minute later to test Clark. Uh... yeah. Then she shoots a blank out of a pistol at Clark in their honeymoon suite to gauge his reaction. Wouldn't Superman realize it was a blank before admitting that he is indeed Supes?I know a lot of the new stuff is purportedly test footage but some of these scenes come across with less snap than a daytime soap. Scenes are stretched out so much that it kills the tension. It's been said that Donner was fighting the producers to keep the movie camp and slapstick free but some of the noweliminated bits are sorely missed. When the Kryptonians are superblowing away the approaching crowd we no longer have the oblivious guy who's laughing into the payphone even after he and it are blown over. And where is Lois's coworker who would comically punctuate the big Metropolis fight scene with her dumb remarks the big one's just as strong as Superman! Lois pushes her. Maybe Donner cut these things simply because he didn't shoot them but why throw away these memorable little jokes in a film otherwise almost completely devoid of humor? The sequences of Non Zod and Ursa getting acquainted with the locals of the Midwest town and the big sprawling city fight the highlight of the original Superman II are now cut up so much that they are flatout dull. So basically if you're going to be stuck on a deserted island forever with only a DVD player and a TV and could only take one version of Superman II it is my opinion that you should bring the theatrical version.".

The extra Marlon Brando stuff is redundant except for Supe getting his powers back scene. Worse yet just to not use Lester's affectionate ending he slaps the unfinished part 1 ending back on as if we're expected to understand and side with him. Sorry Dick. Lester  1 Donner  0.

	schema:reviewBody "It's no secret Van Damme has lost much of what clout he once held at the box office when he's now reserved to doing leads in straighttovideo action flicks. I guess the hindsight is you could say that about any of the other big action stars. It's been awhile since Arnold really pulled in the audiences and even longer for the likes of Stallone Norris and even good 'ol Steven Seagal. So it wasn't the biggest surprise when Van Damme's latest Desert Heat went straight to video. The strangest thing is Desert Heat while it isn't made of gold is leaps and bounds ahead of Universal Soldier 2 that got a theatrical release and Van Damme is actually pretty good when he's relaxed and having fun with a few familiar faces in the supporting cast helping out.This one finds Van Damme as a man at his emotional end. He believes he's got nothing to live for anymore and when we met up with him he's ready to commit suicide and end his life. What happens shortly after that is pretty basic but fuels the rest of the story. A bunch of dirty people try to wax him and leave him for dead and he swears to make them pay in blood. Not entirely original. With more gunplay than there is kicks you have to decide if that's a good or bad thing for a Van Damme flick. It's a case of opinion andor taste more than anything else. The atmosphere is light and everyone seems to be having fun. Which is great. This story couldn't have survived a single viewing if it took itself seriously.I'm not recommending this outright but I'm not saying stay away either. Love or hate Van Damme this is a halfdecent addition to his mixed slate of movies and if nothing else this movie contains one of the most unique sex scenes I've seen in an action movie in a really really long while. It's both erotic and vaguely comical at the same time if you can believe that. You'll have to see the movie to know what I mean but this all goes back to an earlier point. This movie never takes itself seriously for one moment and that's what in the end keeps the movie enjoyable rather than being a pain to watch.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's no secret Van Damme has lost much of what clout he once held at the box office when he's now reserved to doing leads in straighttovideo action flicks. I guess the hindsight is you could say that about any of the other big action stars. It's been awhile since Arnold really pulled in the audiences and even longer for the likes of Stallone Norris and even good 'ol Steven Seagal. So it wasn't the biggest surprise when Van Damme's latest Desert Heat went straight to video. The strangest thing is Desert Heat while it isn't made of gold is leaps and bounds ahead of Universal Soldier 2 that got a theatrical release and Van Damme is actually pretty good when he's relaxed and having fun with a few familiar faces in the supporting cast helping out.This one finds Van Damme as a man at his emotional end. He believes he's got nothing to live for anymore and when we met up with him he's ready to commit suicide and end his life. What happens shortly after that is pretty basic but fuels the rest of the story. A bunch of dirty people try to wax him and leave him for dead and he swears to make them pay in blood. Not entirely original. With more gunplay than there is kicks you have to decide if that's a good or bad thing for a Van Damme flick. It's a case of opinion andor taste more than anything else. The atmosphere is light and everyone seems to be having fun. Which is great. This story couldn't have survived a single viewing if it took itself seriously.I'm not recommending this outright but I'm not saying stay away either.

Sure there are explosions and guns and kicks and a completely unnecessary sex scene and all that but it seems like there are quite a lot comic relief moments and characters. Pat Morita and Bill Erwin reminded me of Statler and Waldorf from The Muppets for one.Van Damme plays an American which meant that he talked very little and tried to talk in a raspy voice to disguise his accent. And you know what? It worked. The only thing that I couldn't let go is because I expected to hear his unique accent.This movie is 95 minutes well spent.

I even enjoyed somehow. The story is simple Bad guys steal his bike that belong to his friend and shoot him. He survives and he wants revenge and take his bike back. The movie tries to be this spiritual movie and it even succeeds in it but the comedy kinda spoils it. I liked the set where the movie was shot. The old people were funny. Ohh that sex scene was hilarious. There is man who goes straight to action! And of cource everybody love Van Dammes martial art kicks and we see them. They save best for end of the film. Checkout Pat Morita from Karate Kid series. Danny Trejo played JCVDs  mysterious friend. Like every review I tell you If you are Van Damme fan you might like it. The movie went straight to video but I think it would do okay in the Box Office. Overall ".

I even enjoyed somehow. The story is simple Bad guys steal his bike that belong to his friend and shoot him. He survives and he wants revenge and take his bike back. The movie tries to be this spiritual movie and it even succeeds in it but the comedy kinda spoils it. I liked the set where the movie was shot. The old people were funny. Ohh that sex scene was hilarious. There is man who goes straight to action! And of cource everybody love Van Dammes martial art kicks and we see them. They save best for end of the film. Checkout Pat Morita from Karate Kid series. Danny Trejo played JCVDs  mysterious friend. Like every review I tell you If you are Van Damme fan you might like it. The movie went straight to video but I think it would do okay in the Box Office. Overall ";

After he has an allucination where he sees his friend Johnny Sixtoes Trejo some thugs attack him leave him for dead and steal his bike. This gives Eddie a new sense in his life... to go after these thugs and kill them. When Eddie wakes up he comes by a village that is used to the agressions by those delinquents and he tries everything he can to stop the bullies and get his bike back.This is a very unusual movie for Van Damme as unlike in his most famous movies he mostly shoots or stabs folks... as he usually kicks the bad guys in the groin. However most of his bullets at times hit the targets and often they make things inexplicably explode. And these scenes made me also laugh a bit.Despite being very violent and a bit raunchy this is a mildly enjoyable adventure movie that will please mostly people with low expectations or adventure movies' fans.".

What in turn happens is that this strangerplayed by JeanClaude Van DAMMEinitiates a minor feud between two foul families the Hogans and the Heathens who are in a partnership regarding the shipment of drugs. Ultimately Eddie LomaxVan DAMMEwill assist the locals engaging in a violent war with both parties the small town a battleground.Funny how this film instigates the developing action. A drunken Lomax firing off bullets from his Colt .45 grazing the vehicle of the loathsome Hogan boys only increasing hostilities as he's shot and left for dead. Perfect setting up for a revenge plot. However what I found interesting was the direction the filmmakers take with this storyline. It becomes almost a complete comedy a nice surprise is how Desert Heat has a spirited sense of humor and an amusing array of oddball characters. Van DAMME looks really relaxed with this cast enjoying himself. Like all these kinds of movies Van DAMME starts systematically eliminating each and every thug..and there's a fresh supply of sweaty desert uglies for him to vanquishuntil a truck load are dumped in a desert hole by handyman Pat Morita..in an inspired bit of casting awaiting the return of a departing love named Berta. You have Vincent Schiavelli as a bar owner who chastises Van DAMME for killing several of his customers despite the fact that they were profane troublemakers. Larry Drake as patriarch Ramsey Hogan sadly is underused and exits the movie far too soon. Gabrielle Fitzpatrick is Van DAMME's love interest a waitress who runs her senile father's diner and yearns for more in life. David Fralick as Matt Hogan is a rather limp adversary for Van DAMMEBolo Leung he's notand their confrontation at the end leaves much to be desired. Jaime Pressly has an early role as another waitress Dottie a very tasty looker who along with her cook brother passed by a fallen Lomax after he had been shot as they were driving to town. Bill Erwin has a hilarious role as a gunstore owner rescued by Lomax after his nephews chained him to his bed waiting for him to die operating his business! A running gag has Erwin dependent upon an oxygen tank while puffing on a cigarette when he isn't sucking air! Priscilla Pointer as a religious kook who operates a ratty motel with her husband..she has an affinity for snakes and is always seen downing flasks and bottles of liquor!. I couldn't help but grin at the idea that this was a remake of Yojimbo. There's plenty of entertaining..if you enjoy low browexchanges between Van DAMME and the townsfolk who take a shine to him. Trejo's character remains enigmatic throughout. What Trejo's Johnny and Lomax were in the past is presented rather ambiguously with the viewer having to read between the lines.".

But the rest is likable.The mix of many genres such as drama action thriller comedy and even romance are very well balanced and deliver a good time. The actors are above average there's no scene that you can say Ooh they are acting. It's sad that the writer wanted to praise Van Damme as the nicest guy ever it seems to be kind of egocentric but it's not irritating enough to spoil the quality of this film. And the airplane scene in the last fight is lame but I will just ignore that.And in the end we have a nice message of friendship. I really recommend this film for entertainment!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is generally held in much lower regard than de Fuentes other 1936 classic Vamanos con Pancho Villa. The conventional wisdom is that Alla en el Rancho Grande despite having been a huge commercial success lacked the artistic merits and brave political message of Vamanos con Pancho Villa which a survey of Mexican cinephiles rated the most important Mexican film ever in a famous 1994 survey. This film on the other hand has been generally regarding in Mexico as fodder for the ignorant masses which set off the culturally embarrassing genre of the ranch comedy.With my expectations tempered by that background I must say that I found Alla en el Rancho Grande to be quite an outstanding surprise. For starters the humor is actually funny yet it's done with a subtly and restraint quite uncommon in Mexican comedy. This is a testament to the skill of the actors as well as the director and editor. Secondly the film does a good job of providing a look into the true life of a Mexican village with references to atole and pulque and the like. It's also filmed on location and it looks and feels authentic. Maybe that's one factor which drew audiences in the day not just their presumed lack of sophistication. The storyline is well developed and character list is fairly busy this is not a primitive talkie like most Mexican films of the 1930s. And the songs are all well done and interesting you'll note no less than the great Emilio Fernandez in the cockfight dance. Gabriel Figueroa a student of Eisenstein and a contemporary of Greg Tolland does steady early work here as cinematographer. Finally Esther Fernandez is perfectly cast as the orphaned Cruz her youthful spark and eversoslightly coquettish glances provide a remarkable complexity and attraction to her character which in fact make the whole story line plausible.Mexican cinephiles tend to be excessively slanted towards high art in film call it elitism and are also frequently tinted by a mild strain of malinchismo a peculiar yet pernicious domestic strain of selfloathing or mental slavery. Unencumbered by those mental deficiencies I must say that Alla en el Rancho Grande might actually be the height of pre classic Mexican cinema.A final note de Fuentes remade this film in 1949 with Jorge Negrete in the lead. Needless to say it was a sad retread unworthy of the original film.".

Typically the male protagonists are charros fancy dress Mexican cowboys who sing songs and fight hard in the name of their masculine honor.IMDb classifies this movie as a comedy which it is not. The confusion probably springs from the fact that All en el Rancho Grande is usually classified by Mexican and U.S. Academics as a 'Comedia Ranchera.' Technically the humor here is secondary to the songs and the melodrama so perhaps it would be more accurate to refer to this movie as a melodrama in the Ranchero genre. Debates aside don't expect the movie to be a comedy although it has humor in it.This original version directed by Fernando Fuentes who was arguably the greatest Mexican director of the 1930's El Compadre Mendoza El Prisionero 13 and Vmonos con Pancho Villa are masterpieces is MUCH better than the 1949 remake starring Jorge Negrete. I say this with all due respect to the iconic stature of Negrete a beloved Mexican star. The actors in this movie are younger fresher and more realistic. There's something shopworn about the later version everyone seems older than they should be and less likable.I love the embroidered Charro shirts worn by the actors in this movie.".

It is built up to an almost unbearable degree such that you feel the romantic tension gradually but forcefully.

No. There is no love at first sight they had to work hard for their love. They have to fight against their fears against the politics and they haven't got enough force to start this fight again to stay together because of this lack of trust. We saw the final motive in Meet Joe Black when the man decided to have only the good memories about the loved woman and didn't want to stay for the upcoming harder and probably more boring days when they accommodate to each other so left her.".

I somehow got touched by it most probably I fell in love with the child Kata and when we had to leave the place in the middle of the film the only thing I was hoping that we would catch at least the end at home. I was literally depressed for not being able to watch it it was a very strange feeling for me at that age. As an adult I thought about this movie a lot of times but never got to watch it again till it was aired on TV again yesterday. Speaking of time shifts the music which of course I did not remember until I heard it again now was completely familiar since I started to play piano a few years ago and Corelli's Sarabande was one of the first pieces I played. So this was a wonderful experience for me. Sorry for keeping it long with irrelevant stuff In 1970 it must have been very difficult for Istvan Szabo to deal with the anticommunist revolution theme. Jancsi was isolated from his love because of the communists yet Szabo had to include scenes where revolutionists behave like Nazis rather than fighting for all youth and the future. And of course the story in Paris about bad Nazis like it was happening again in 1956. But it was probably the deal.".

	schema:reviewBody "Love film is an early film from director Istvan Szabo who is most widely known for Mephisto 1981. The Czech new wave ended abruptly with troops of the Warsaw pact knocking down the spring of Prague but in Hungary innovative filmmaking went on for a while. Istvan Szabo followed in the footsteps of Miklos Jancso but was also influenced by the French Nouvelle vague.Special about Love film is the way in which the story is told. It is not told in chronological order nor is it told in reverse chronological order such as in Memento 2000 Christopher Nolan. In stead the film leaps forwards and backwards in time in a seemingly random fashion. We do see some events a couple of times and from other events we have to guess whether they have happened in reality or only in the phantasy of the characters. We also see this sort of jumping back and forth through time in Little women 2019 Greta Gerwig but most of all it reminds me of the Polish author Wieslaw Mysliwski who is a real master in this way of storytelling.The story of Love film itself has much in common with The unbearable lightness of being 1988 Philip Kaufman. A man and a woman who seem to be lovers are seperated from each other because one has left the country after a national uprising in this instance Hungary 1956 has been suppressed by the Soviets. The other one stays in his homecountry. Love film is the more personal film of the two. The political message is much less explicit but certainly not absent. The film is overwhelmingly about the personal relationship between the two main characters from their childhood on and what the seperations meant for this relationship.".

We do see some events a couple of times and from other events we have to guess whether they have happened in reality or only in the phantasy of the characters. We also see this sort of jumping back and forth through time in Little women 2019 Greta Gerwig but most of all it reminds me of the Polish author Wieslaw Mysliwski who is a real master in this way of storytelling.The story of Love film itself has much in common with The unbearable lightness of being 1988 Philip Kaufman. A man and a woman who seem to be lovers are seperated from each other because one has left the country after a national uprising in this instance Hungary 1956 has been suppressed by the Soviets. The other one stays in his homecountry. Love film is the more personal film of the two. The political message is much less explicit but certainly not absent. The film is overwhelmingly about the personal relationship between the two main characters from their childhood on and what the seperations meant for this relationship.";

	schema:reviewBody "Omamamia or Oma in Roma is a German movie from 2012 so this one has its 5th anniversary this year. It runs for 100 minutes and was directed by Tomy Wigand The screenplay comes from 3 female writers and I won't list the names here you can check the list for yourself. As for the cast the main character is played by Marianne Sgebrecht while her daughter and granddaughter are portrayed by Annette Frier and Miriam Stein. The most known supporting performance is by Giancarlo Giannini Oscar nominee who plays Sgebrecht's character's potential love interest here and many may know him from Craig's Bond movies. But now back to this one here I think it sounds somewhat promising in terms of the cast and story but the result is extremely weak and disappointing. Sgebrecht may be good at playing likable characters but honestly she has been playing the exact same character for decades now older obese women who try to fix everything and are appreciated by almost everybody yet they depict her as flawed and almost sacrificing her own happiness for others.And the comedy involving her is honestly extremely embarrassing. In the most random scene of the film she uses pepper spray against a con artist but he quickly moves aside and so the pepper spray hits the Pope. Needless to say that for whatever reason the Pope is apparently guarded by complete amateurs and yet Sgebrecht's character is released only hours later despite an incident that is reported on international television. Equally needless to say that her character of course ends up in love only a couple scenes later with the guy she wanted to use the pepper spray on. And if that isn't enough of change already her daughter and granddaughter face struggles  potential breakups at the exact same time with their significant others. One thing is safe This family does not have it with German men. Anyway right when they probably realized that Stein's character added absolutely nothing to the entire movie they included a cheating story about her boyfriend. The only purpose there was to show how strong and desirable Stein's character is and to show us how she deals with the situation like a confident woman would and how the boyfriend suffers because of how he hurt an amazing woman like Stein's character. It is all pretty cringeworthy and the worst about it all is that I personally think Stein is not just one of the most attractive but also among the most talented actresses under 30 in Germany Austria right now and she sure would have deserved a much better storyline. Needless to say that Sgebrecht's character also gets her moment with the cheating boyfriend.Anyway overall this film is all so expected so stereotypical and its biggest problem is probably that it does not take any risks at all. This film is exactly what you could have expected to happen with the worst possible scenario. Frier and Stein have a good moment here at least but as for Sgebrecht I am really sick of her overandoverthesame routine. The script also does not do them any favors with the generic retirement home part that has been done over and over again and just can't bring any emotion anymore especially as it has been done better most of the time so far. The ending is another letdown as in the spirit of every schmaltzy small screen movie even the biggest problems are fixed within the last 10 minutes out of nowhere so that audiences are happy when leaving the theater. The easilyentertained at least. The ending feels even less authentic and realistic than the rest of the film and it takes quite something. The comment by Frier's character's husband about sex at the end feels like taken from a Christine Neubauer television schmaltz film. Enough said. This one here is a major disappointment and you need to stay far far away.".

	schema:headline " Investigation on a movie above its notoriety .";
	schema:reviewBody "Indagine su un cittadino al di sopra di ogni sopetto Investigation of a citizen above suspicion is a surrealistic policestory directed by the Italian filmmaker Elio Petri in 1970 . A very original screenplay tells us the story of a respected police inspector who commits a crime and deliberately leaves clues just to find out how big is his reputation of a citizen above suspicion . The theme is developed from this single event and becomes an intelligent and provocative reflection about the concepts of authority and institution . While some could wrongly see this movie as a leftwing political one because of the way it depicts police authorities' excessive power  It is really only a fair illustration denouncing the impotence of institutions of making an impartial investigation about their own mistakes . The main theme of the movie rises up a brilliant and paradoxical question  how can the organs which administrate the Law condemn themselves without risking their own collapse and negation ? To this question the movie answers with the pessimistic vision that a real justice is an utopia because of humanbeings' weaknesses and selfpreservative nature . This brilliant reflection is developed in an highly entertaining and smoothly constructed satirical policestory  in fact the movie has an overwhelming funny tone especially thanks to Gian Maria Volonte' superb acting in the main role of the fascistoid police inspector . The ending will surprise you with the way it reveals the surrealistic nature of the whole topic . Even if this movie was highly awarded and acclaimed at its time  1 Oscar for Best foreign film  1 Nomination for Best original screenplay  won Grand Prize of the Jury and Golden Palm nomination at Cannes Films Festival  1 Golden globe nomination  at the present days it has been criminally forgotten . I can only add that I personally consider it one of the best Italian films ever made and one of the most provocative policestories in the last 40 years . Unfortunately it suffers of a very poor international distribution so  unless you live in Italy  it won't be easy for you to find this movie . But it doesn't matter how hard it will be  it will be worth it .".

	schema:reviewBody "Some comments in light of previous descriptions of the movie. This movie is definitively about state violence. Even if to a viewer that has no foreknowledge of the police state that was instituted in Italy with the help of the CIA as the movie alludes to in order to keep the Communist Party from taking power the PCI had the biggest following of any parties at that time the fact remains that the movie is not much more surreal than the sociopolitical reality facing the filmmaker. Murders and suicides while in police custody of leftwing political activists and of anarchists are a fact that Elio Petri was painfully aware of. He made a documentary called Streghi dello stato witches of the state where Jean Maria Volonte and others expose such suicides. Elio Petri was politically aware and through out his work there is criticism of the right wing of Italian politics see TODO MORO. I think that the movie is most powerful once you are aware of the fact that you can be victimized at the hands of an institution esp. at the hands of an institution that exists only to maintain political order. Once the politicization of the priorities of those institutions that have the legitimate use of violence occurs than meaningless violence towards the innocent will be allowed if punishing it would impair the political functions of the state machinery. Flora Balkan is perhaps a symbol for the masses their love of violence and power their love for the undoing of their freedoms. A very fine movie that requires some effort but that is always actual  thanks to an interesting narration of human nature. The movie does have it's flaws and i the action is not as invigorated as one expects it to be after the first 15 minutes neither is the camera work at the level it has to be for this movie to be the greatest ever but it is still a hell of a great movie. Whether or not you agree with this movie's negative portrayal of state violence and of that primal attraction that violence has explored in a marvelously Mediterranean style in this movie for so many could make the difference in how much you are puzzled by the movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Indagine su un cittadino al di sopra di ogni sospetto is probably the most original detective story ever made since the protagonist is at the same time the only one who is really trying to solve the case AND the murderer.I have not spoiled anything it happens right at the beginning. An Italian police inspector Volont murders his lover and in a sort of challenge towards the law leaves many clues incriminating himself while his colleagues investigate the case he begins showing up where he isn't supposed to mentioning details he should keep quiet about and in general trying to prove how a person in his position will always be sure of his impunity regardless of what he does. The social satire is bitterly effective. For example there is a brilliant little scene between the protagonist and his chief. With fake naivet the inspector admits he knew the victim and asks the chief if he should mention it to the detectives following the case. There is a brief pause and then the chief with a smug and vastly amused grin lets the matter drop shakes hand with the inspector and wishes him a good day. It's wonderfully subtle.The best scene however has to be the interrogation of a seedy youth who suspects the protagonist but refuses to cooperate with the police. The contrast between the inspector's spoken words You are a democratic citizen! And I must respect you! and his malevolent tone body language and methods is spinechilling.Gian Maria Volont best known outside Italy as the villain in the first two movies of Leone's Dollar Trilogy carries the movie with an exceptional performance. His inspector is probably one of the most despicable main characters ever seen and yet his mesmerizing portrayal captures our attention. He is a complex crazed individual loudmouthed sardonic and obnoxiously jovial in public but secretly cold creepy and reptilian. An Oscarworthy turn.810".

What Petri has left out from this excerpt is also that to doubt his integrity is to doubt the Law itself. The he in question here is the man of the Law  the police inspector  played brilliantly hair slicked back et al by Gian Maria Volont. Without any scruples we see the Inspector coldly cut his mistress's throat with a razor between the sheets in a kinky roleplaying romp sans scruples only to prove to himself if he is as he believes a citizen above suspicion and beyond the Law which he so firmly adheres to.This complex film is a cinematic gem thanks to its multifarious tropes  at times absurd black comedy at times vitriolic political satire at times psychological study into sexual fetishism and power. Of course all of these themes intermingle so effortlessly that you can't help but be taken aback by the richness of Petri's byzantine vision. The leftleaning director here depicts the autocratic terror that overtook Italy in the late 60s an overture to the tense decadelong period known as the years of lead in Italian politics  a time of fascist repression and a struggle between the equallyasextreme left and right of center parties.Beyond its political overtones which are universal yet now paradoxically outdated as we see rebellious students waving their little red Maoist books around to anger the fascist pigs in the police force Investigation plays its strongest and most universal hand in its view of authority and specifically those that wield an ungodly amount of it. The Inspector in a snug black suit commands and degrades his subordinates yet in the way a responsible teacher would reprimand a naughty student. That is he believes his own righteousness and position and here once he commits the murder of Augusta Terzi the stunning Florinda Bolkan he leaves the Law to spin its wheels of Justice having full confidence in the organ of power that commands him. As the Inspector sits in the office of his boss the Commissioner a sleazy Gianni Santuccio he trembles like a child waiting for approval and acceptance. After the latter admits to having an affair with the murdered victim the unperturbed Commissioner asks him amidst a smokefilled smirk holding a cigar in his fat fingers So was she you know? Any good? Here we can make the link between power and sexual impotence as the simple reason the Inspector kills his lover is because she has brought to light his personal inadequacies as a man. An individual who holds such dominance over others who commands such authority is an addictive aphrodisiac for Bolkan's underwearhating heroine but after a while she sees her Inspector is nothing more than a capricious child obsessed and deceived with a position of power that holds no integrity and no truth. For her his sexual appeal has vanished the organ of dominance has grown limp as the incongruity between the Inspector's projected image and his actual self begins to grow. She hates his little black socks his dull black suit and his overall bureaucratic appearance. In a few great satirical moments we see the impressionable Inspector strolling the streets in a trendy new khaki suit a purple silk ascot fashionable sunglasses  a caricature of Italian culture to the fullest.So what prompts Volont's Inspector to make his final decision? Is he a stern follower of the Law who wants to test it and prove himself superior to his inept colleagues a sadistic neofascist bureaucrat who lives for control and subjugation of others an infantile with a bruised ego thanks to an untamable feminine force? Are we as viewers not to question his actions but simply to accept them as necessary because he's a man of the Law superior to us despite his faults as Kafka leads us to believeor is that just Petri's tongueincheek humor getting the best of us? That's the fun of this great film and the kookiness of Ennio Morricone's twangy score adds to the comical effect of a dark and witty tude into power sex and politics.".

	schema:headline " Gian Maria Volonte is the soul of this Thrilling Intelligent and Politically Incorrect Masterpiece ...";
	schema:reviewBody "Authority Order Power these are Law's three pillars. Law protects citizens and defends them against crime. Law is made of values and incarnated by men. Those men serve Law serve citizens and the mission's nobility lies on the fact that it applies to anyone. That's the basis of democracy and the strength of Law. No one is above it. Therefore in a fair system anyone can be theoretically suspect. But the weakness of Law is that it paradoxically implies the use of its main dual medium  repression and punishment which are after all the only way to protect the good citizens ... as potential victims. So let's say to make it simpler that Law has two arms one holding a shield to protect the good citizens and the other holding a sword to punish the bad ones.One man called Il Dottore is holding the sword. He was the former Head of Homicide Squad and leads now the Political Bureau of the Italian Security Court. His speech in the beginning of the film clearly announces him as a man with palpable fascist tendencies although the overuse of the word 'fascist' kind of weakens its meaning. This man incarnated by Gian Maria Volonte exults the value of a powerful state above any consideration of individual rights. The state must be powerful authoritarian and any ideas that threaten Law and Order should be mercilessly fought. It's too simplistic to call this 'fascism' some would say fascism was born in Italy which would explain that the ideas of a man like Il Dottore could be impregnated by a certain fascist vision but they'd be forgetting that Italy is also the country of Machiavelli and the whole plot of this psychological political thriller could be considered as a deep Machiavellian character study.Il Dottore is fascist in his beliefs and Machiavelian in his acts two contradictions that totally cancel each other out and makes him more of a very interesting pathological case of egomania. The man wants to prove that the very system that maintains Law and Order Police and Justice is flawed because it ensures the existence of citizens beyond suspicion. This man wants to denounce the main obstacle the thing that makes his job ethically useless. The mission sounds noble... except that the way he chose to prove his point is the act of a maniac. A crime to denounce to make the point he himself incarnates that there are some citizens above suspicion. So high above this suspicion that they can leave clues to denounce themselves without never being worried. Because people believe in men who incarnate order. Power's aura seems more efficient than its use. Power relies on its own abuse.And that's the theme of the film. What is power? Il Dottore incarnates it with such charisma and virile magnetism that whatever comes off his mouth sounds like the truth. If he says he's guilty it can't be anything but irony or sarcasm. The simple thought that he could be guilty of the crime he committed sounds like a blasphemy. Indeed the power is a deified notion. And like the power of God is perceived in our everyday life the same goes for Law. Order is real and can't be based on abstraction. The paradox is that an abstraction is not palpable enough to be respected. Fear of punishment controls people more than interests as said Machiavelli. Therefore it is no surprise that socialism is considered as an escapism from individual interests and therefore can understand only one language  repression. Il Dottore handles the questioning of the leftwing activists just as if he had personal reasons to fight them because they're the most likely people to legitimate the use of repressive violence. Indeed it is personal. Jealousy weakness humiliation power is represented by men who are flawed. This is a brilliant character study of a man using power as an artifice to disguise his weaknesses. He's the Law but he's a citizen he's power and he's powerless. His interactions with his victim totally deconstruct the character and extinguish the aura and prestige he incarnates for his men. With this woman his authority is like the toy the little boy proudly shows. Power allows him to run a red light or share some gross crimerelated experiences so voyeur it sounds childish. They're big children but they have the power. So whom the power belongs to ? Women? Anarchists? Who's the leader? the system ? No what leads the world is only human judgment ... The truth is in its appearance and this is what guides human perception.Il Dottore denounces these fallacious perceptions in such an original way we also can't believe this man has this status and is so respected which makes us question the legitimacy of some our leaders ... after all men are men and behind every great man there's a woman and who really knows how these socalled great men behave with these women? Gian Maria Volonte gives us a hint through an extraordinary performance. In the cinematic world of character studies Il Dottore is a living paradox highlighting our own weaknesses as men who believe in a system of powers or our owns for the luckiest ones. His charisma makes him all the more pathetic in some key scenes and his pathos more admirable in some others. Elio Petri's investigation is a fascinating political thriller whose introspectively paranoid feeling is sublimated by Ennio Morricone's score.Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion is an intelligent masterpiece denouncing the paradoxical nature of Law where the holders of the sword tend to fight those who hide themselves behind the shield while the shield protects only those who use the sword.

	onyx:emotionText "Authority Order Power these are Law's three pillars. Law protects citizens and defends them against crime. Law is made of values and incarnated by men. Those men serve Law serve citizens and the mission's nobility lies on the fact that it applies to anyone. That's the basis of democracy and the strength of Law. No one is above it. Therefore in a fair system anyone can be theoretically suspect. But the weakness of Law is that it paradoxically implies the use of its main dual medium  repression and punishment which are after all the only way to protect the good citizens ... as potential victims. So let's say to make it simpler that Law has two arms one holding a shield to protect the good citizens and the other holding a sword to punish the bad ones.One man called Il Dottore is holding the sword. He was the former Head of Homicide Squad and leads now the Political Bureau of the Italian Security Court. His speech in the beginning of the film clearly announces him as a man with palpable fascist tendencies although the overuse of the word 'fascist' kind of weakens its meaning. This man incarnated by Gian Maria Volonte exults the value of a powerful state above any consideration of individual rights. The state must be powerful authoritarian and any ideas that threaten Law and Order should be mercilessly fought. It's too simplistic to call this 'fascism' some would say fascism was born in Italy which would explain that the ideas of a man like Il Dottore could be impregnated by a certain fascist vision but they'd be forgetting that Italy is also the country of Machiavelli and the whole plot of this psychological political thriller could be considered as a deep Machiavellian character study.Il Dottore is fascist in his beliefs and Machiavelian in his acts two contradictions that totally cancel each other out and makes him more of a very interesting pathological case of egomania. The man wants to prove that the very system that maintains Law and Order Police and Justice is flawed because it ensures the existence of citizens beyond suspicion. This man wants to denounce the main obstacle the thing that makes his job ethically useless. The mission sounds noble... except that the way he chose to prove his point is the act of a maniac. A crime to denounce to make the point he himself incarnates that there are some citizens above suspicion. So high above this suspicion that they can leave clues to denounce themselves without never being worried. Because people believe in men who incarnate order. Power's aura seems more efficient than its use. Power relies on its own abuse.And that's the theme of the film. What is power? Il Dottore incarnates it with such charisma and virile magnetism that whatever comes off his mouth sounds like the truth. If he says he's guilty it can't be anything but irony or sarcasm. The simple thought that he could be guilty of the crime he committed sounds like a blasphemy. Indeed the power is a deified notion. And like the power of God is perceived in our everyday life the same goes for Law. Order is real and can't be based on abstraction. The paradox is that an abstraction is not palpable enough to be respected. Fear of punishment controls people more than interests as said Machiavelli. Therefore it is no surprise that socialism is considered as an escapism from individual interests and therefore can understand only one language  repression. Il Dottore handles the questioning of the leftwing activists just as if he had personal reasons to fight them because they're the most likely people to legitimate the use of repressive violence. Indeed it is personal. Jealousy weakness humiliation power is represented by men who are flawed. This is a brilliant character study of a man using power as an artifice to disguise his weaknesses. He's the Law but he's a citizen he's power and he's powerless. His interactions with his victim totally deconstruct the character and extinguish the aura and prestige he incarnates for his men. With this woman his authority is like the toy the little boy proudly shows. Power allows him to run a red light or share some gross crimerelated experiences so voyeur it sounds childish. They're big children but they have the power. So whom the power belongs to ? Women? Anarchists? Who's the leader? the system ? No what leads the world is only human judgment ... The truth is in its appearance and this is what guides human perception.Il Dottore denounces these fallacious perceptions in such an original way we also can't believe this man has this status and is so respected which makes us question the legitimacy of some our leaders ... after all men are men and behind every great man there's a woman and who really knows how these socalled great men behave with these women? Gian Maria Volonte gives us a hint through an extraordinary performance. In the cinematic world of character studies Il Dottore is a living paradox highlighting our own weaknesses as men who believe in a system of powers or our owns for the luckiest ones. His charisma makes him all the more pathetic in some key scenes and his pathos more admirable in some others. Elio Petri's investigation is a fascinating political thriller whose introspectively paranoid feeling is sublimated by Ennio Morricone's score.Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion is an intelligent masterpiece denouncing the paradoxical nature of Law where the holders of the sword tend to fight those who hide themselves behind the shield while the shield protects only those who use the sword. Gian Maria Volonte is the soul of this contradiction.";

	schema:reviewBody "Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion is a Italian film released in 1970 with an original provocative and challengeable story about how corruptive and deceivable some people might be and that those who supposed to be on the right side of the law are more likely to do bad things. In Elio Petri's film Gian Maria Volont plays a chief of police in charge of the complex murder of a prostitute played by Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan. Detail He killed her and he left clues deliberately trying to get caught by his colleagues. The romantic involvement between the woman and the chief of police is presented in flashbacks showing the crime's motivation. And along with the difficult and you can even say ironic funny investigation there's Italy's political background during the 1970's since the chief of police is also trying to arrest many communists manifestants who are fighting against the new political establishment. Some of the characters and the movie's visual reminds of Z but this thriller is a little more soft and less complicated. Both are fascinating and must see movies of all time. Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion is a powerful statement on hypocrisy and corporatism disguised as an investigation movie. The main character always poses as someone arrogant who feels that he's the law and every people should respect him even his lover but she's more wise and tries to humiliate him all the time. Here's a guy who persecutes all the supposed enemies of the government claiming that the country needs to have a firm and solid moral structure free of communists homosexuals manifestants and prostitutes but he's involved with one and killed her yet he wants to be arrested so that he can say that the law was respected. One thing is ironic and good about him is that he tries to frame someone as the possible murder of the woman but he always finds a way to make these people innocent very fast. A great accomplish by Gian Maria Volonte who played the chief of police brilliantly with enormous qualities in a flawless performance. His character only demonstrates his desire to get caught leaving clues prints but when he sees that his colleagues are not working very well he gets mad always trying to leave more and more clues. Winner of the Academy Award of Best Foreign Film in 1971 and nominated for Best Screenplay in the following year this movie was robbed an nomination for best music composed by the exceptional Ennio Morricone a great and thrilling piece of composition. One of those themes you can't easily forget. Great cinema from the 1970's. 1010".

In the 1990's sometime IFC aired the film and I was lucky enough to tape it and then transfer it to DVD.During the years following seeing the film I would recommend the film to all my friends. What struck me when I had the chance to view it again was how well I had remembered the movie every scene. Few if any movies ever made such a lasting impression from my first viewing and it still has that effect.Besides the great script and direction what made it complete was one of the finest performances by an actor I've ever seen. It is up there with the greatest work of such as Olivier O'Toole Depardieu and Mastroianni to name a few whose work was staggering.As to its unavailability maybe someone should rattle IFC's cage asking them to air it again or maybe get TCM to air it.".

I think though what it is about the movie that leaves me somewhat dissatisfied is as another reviewer here mentioned that it comes across as very one dimensional and onenote in it's presentation.People here are saying 'This is the greatest of Italian Cinema'... Well I can immediately think of at least 10 Italian films right off the top that I like a HELL of a lot better than this one. There are some truly Classic Italian Gialli to die for but that's just me... I guess I must apparently be missing something. Like many other reviewers here I KNOW that the point of the film is that in a kind of Kafkaesque way the highly placed bureaucrat CANNOT get himself caught even though he is compelled to tell his men to 'do their job!' Thus the clear title of the film. And as also mentioned here I KNOW it is about the Fascism of the state etc... So the premise itself is indeed quite novel and interesting.I don't know... I just didn't really find it that entertaining personally. I thought what it was trying to get across was a good point but EXTREMELY simple and not really that interesting at least to me. And the soundtrack... EVERYONE is just about foaming at the mouth at how this is the BEST Morricone score EVER! Well I don't see it. That annoying spring 'Boing' sound every frigg'n 20 seconds gets VERY VERY old after a while. I found it annoying and not at all likable or 'Brilliant' sorry...And although the performance of the lead character was excellent and he obviously did an outstanding job in his role still overall I just couldn't get into the film at any level. There was nothing special I felt about the screenplay or dialog that was clever or memorable I didn't find the overall plot or story that interesting although the idea itself was rather unique and possibly COULD have been much more involving. It just came across to me like the same note being played over and over and over...It appears that in this case just about every one else here is at odds with me about this movie but what I primarily look for is whether a film is ENJOYABLE  ENTERTAINING I'm afraid that I just don't feel that this was the case here. When I review films I put that particular parameter FIRST above all others in other words no matter what the genre or even whether I particularly like it or not I try to put myself in the place of the average moviegoer or movie lover and try to determine firstly if the film was truly entertaining or engaging in any way. And after 2 long hours of this one I just felt that I really wish I had chosen something else to watch...I admit I may very well be missing the point of this movie. OR... possibly the particular style in which this film was made just simply doesn't resonate with me personally. So the honest recommendation from me would be to suggest that you read numerous detailed reviews here to get a better overall picture of WHY many here DO like this movie and then judge for yourselves.

	schema:reviewBody "When people ask me why I'm so fanatic about Italian cinema I always refer to the beautiful Gothic horrors of Mario Bava the outrageous splatter flicks of Lucio Fulci the virulent Poliziotesschi thrillers of Umberto Lenzi or the stylish Gialli of Dario Argento. Quite often however this still isn't sufficient to persuade them of the fact that Italy is the best filmproducing country in history. Perhaps if I refer more directly to the political dramathrillers of Eli Petri and particularly Investigation of a Citizen above Suspicion they will finally understand Investigation of a Citizen above Suspicion won the Academy Award for best foreign language film in 1971 but according to the data here on this website the film received another nomination in 1972 in the category best original screenplay. I don't know how it's possible for the same film to get nominated in two different years but I can state that winning a prize for the screenplay is even more justified and deserved than winning for the overall best film. The story and screenplay are definitely the most brilliant aspects of this movie. The basic story idea is perhaps even the most purely genius one that I have ever encountered and I think I've seen more than 5.000 films The plot is about a police detective formerly homicide department but now promoted to political supervision squad who kills his mistress in cold blood and deliberately leaves all sorts of clues fingerprints footprints clothing fibers behind in the apartment that unmistakably lead to him as the culprit. Why? Because he's convinced that he will get away with this murder and never get arrested regardless of how obviously all the evidence points towards him. And why is that? Because apart from being the most arrogant and obnoxious person in the world 'Il Dottore' is also a very prominent powerful and influential member of the community.  And the corrupt Italian political system simply doesn't allow for respectable citizens like him to be accused of filthy crimes such as murder. Perhaps it's just me but I still get blown away myself every time I mention this plot concept to anyone! It's such a clever courageous and 200 unconventional subject and the incredibly gifted Elio Petri processed it into a harsh but unforgettable and intelligent thrillersatire. The film ends with a quote of Franz Kafka that sums up the whole thing quite neatly but most viewers will already have made the comparison with Kafka earlier during the film as well. Investigation of a Citizen above Suspicion certainly has a couple of defaults but other and more essential aspects are impeccably brilliant. Notably the screenplay as mentioned already but surely also the unique performance of Gian Maria Volont as Il Dottore. Volont depicts what is arguably the most loathsome and disturbing protagonist in cinematic history and that includes serial killers mass murderers and 10ft tall alien monsters! His arrogance and menace is unequaled and for that alone Volont also should have received an Oscar. Florinda Bolkan as the victim primarily appearing in flashback sequences is terrific as well. She's sensual playfully provocative and  in her own self destructive fashion  even more powerful than Il Dottore. Last but not least there's another truly masterful score by Ennio Morricone. If the music initially seems goofy or misfit to the tone of the film just bear with it and I guarantee that you'll be hooked on it forever after.".

However the path that ultimately led me to it was quite thorny I first caught the start of it during a rare Italian TV primetime screening in the mid1980s then after dropping off the radar for decades it turned up again on latenight Italian TV but the reception was terrible so I could not tape it later still having finally acquired it on my PC the hard disk went bust before I had a chance to make myself a copyso that I had to get hold of it via the same channels all over again when the PC was back on its feet!! Even so a whole year passed before I actually sat down to watch it on the heels of two other Elio PetriGian Maria Volonte' films. INVESTIGATION OF A CITIZEN ABOVE SUSPICION won a clutch of other international awards so it is not all that surprising to see it emerge triumphant at the Oscars as well and after seeing it for myself I cannot say I was displeased by that fact. In short the film is a veritable masterpiece brilliantlymade and utterly fascinating albeit making for typically demanding viewing particularly during its latter stages. As can be gleaned from the title the plot revolves around a crime actually the murder of his mistress committed by a highlyrespected public official ironically the culprit is none other than the exiting Chief of the Homicide Squad Gian Maria Volonte' who is on fire throughout as the megalomaniac protagonist  on his way out to becoming the Head of Political Intelligence  and which of course he has the duty to investigate himself! This he does with complete confidence and not a little trickery destroying andor planting evidence deviating the path of the investigation but at the same time admitting to his new superior of having known the victim etc. His unusual relationship with the latter sensuously played by Florinda Bolkan then is seen via intermittent flashbacks she is a libertine much is made of the fact that she possesses no underwear! initially getting in touch with Volonte' almost in jest and eventually playing the willing murdered party! in reenactments of crimes of passion solved by him throughout his illustrious career of which he unashamedly also keeps photographic records. Other important figures to feature in the narrative are Arturo Dominici from Mario Bava's BLACK Sunday 1960 as Volonte''s longsuffering successor a young student radical who lives in the same apartment block as Bolkan and of whom Volonte' was jealous and Salvo Randone like the star a Petri regular as a confused old man to whom the pompous antihero actually confesses his guilt in the matter and bullies into turning him over to the Policebut the latter naturally is shocked to see him lording it at the Homicide bureau! For all the social and political relevance of Petri and frequent collaborator Ugo Pirro's Oscarnominated script  culminating in a delicious double ending Volonte''s quasisurreal exoneration by his colleagues after he professes to have committed the ultimate sacrifice for the good of Established Law  Order is revealed to have been mere wishfulfillment on his partwith the true development of the facts cleverly left to the audience members' own judgment  the element which has perhaps been mainly responsible for securing the film its longevity is Ennio Morricone's celebrated bizarre i.e. halfurgent halfplayful score which definitely ranks among his finest works and that's saying a lot!".

	schema:reviewBody "There is an epilogue appropriately enough from Kafka because this is the story of a bureaucrat who is highly placed in the police hierarchy and can't seem to convince anyone that he's committed the murder of a whore he was having a relationship with. And in the end the family nonchalantly sweeps out the dead bug.Gian Maria Volonte is the recently promoted head of the homicide squad. At first I thought his performance was stereotypical. He struts around with a smirk shouts orders demands that the espresso coffee machine be removed pursues and uses enhanced interrogation on demonstrators communists socialists homosexuals and kids with long hair. This is 1970. The hooker he's boffing turns out to be a police buff and loves to be interrogated harshly by Volonte. He makes her kneel slaps her about and talks her into revealing her most shameful secrets.But then whimsically she throws him over for someone else claiming that he's not manly enough for her that he's a baby who probably still wets the bed  so he cuts her throat. He deliberately leaves clues to his identity all over the crime scene.So far so routine. He's so ridden with guilt over his actions that he wants to be caught. In addition he's a stern representative of oppressive power hectoring the young. We've seen this before.But at about the half way mark things begin to get a little screwy. His colleagues believe that since he is a man of such prestige and power all the clues must be coincidental and misleading even the most obvious. When his prints are found on a liqueur glass a subordinate remembers Volante taking a drink to calm his nerves. For what it's worth this is called normalization in sociology a process in which incidents that don't quite fit the expected narrative are reinterpreted in such a way that they do.As the story progresses Volonte's efforts to inculpate himself become more frenzied. He dismisses others who might be obvious suspects. He reveals himself as the murderer to a frightened plumber. Nothing works.By the end he's confessed openly to his superiors and then gone home to await arrest. A dozen big wigs arrive and tear up the evidence claiming that he must be neurotic because he's worked too hard. That scene seems to have taken place only in Volonte's imagination because eventually the same big wigs really DO arrive  or seem to  and he joins them in the lobby presses a button and an elevator we never knew was there begins to lift them all silently to an upper story. It's a surreal departure from the relatively realistic plot that we've been following.I found it a little annoying at times. I understand Volonte's role calls for bombast but Cripes what a lot of close ups of shouting faces. Everybody shouts at everybody else. Everybody walks quickly. It's exhausting to watch and listen to except that Ennio Morricone's musical score is both subtle and apt. The first two thirds would have made a good B feature in Hollywood back in the 40s. That last third  well make of it what you will.".

A dozen big wigs arrive and tear up the evidence claiming that he must be neurotic because he's worked too hard. That scene seems to have taken place only in Volonte's imagination because eventually the same big wigs really DO arrive  or seem to  and he joins them in the lobby presses a button and an elevator we never knew was there begins to lift them all silently to an upper story. It's a surreal departure from the relatively realistic plot that we've been following.I found it a little annoying at times. I understand Volonte's role calls for bombast but Cripes what a lot of close ups of shouting faces. Everybody shouts at everybody else. Everybody walks quickly. It's exhausting to watch and listen to except that Ennio Morricone's musical score is both subtle and apt. The first two thirds would have made a good B feature in Hollywood back in the 40s. That last third  well make of it what you will.";

For this reason alone the film is important historically.The head of the homicide department with the police has just been given a promotionto be the head of the political branch. What this actually means is that he's in charge of a KGBlike organization which routinely ignores human rights and their motto seems to be 'the end justifies the means' when dealing with threats to the conservative government. While you are never sure exactly why early in the film he murders his mistress. And to make it more confusing he often deliberately does things to make it obvious HE committed the crime. The weird way that his comrades in the government react to this information make this a film worth seeing. However I should also point out that the movie isn't especially exciting or enjoyable to watch...and could have used a bit of life injected into the story.".

The political point about 'citizens above suspicion' is made with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer and the main character is both unsympathetic and implausible. The answer to the question 'what's the character's motivation?' shouldn't be 'to prove a political point the director wants to make'. I'm not even unsympathetic to the politics I just don't think they're effectively expressed in a feature film if it lacks plausible characterization. Of course you could go for allout satire but despite flirting with that approach Petri sticks for the most part with telling it straight and it just doesn't work because the plot is so contrived.".

On a technical note the film was restored in 4HD but the subtitles are totally out of sync with the dialogue. The fact that I speak some Italian made it worse.
