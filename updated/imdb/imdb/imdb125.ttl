For years the socalled filmmakers at this trash factory have been doing little more than churning out some of the worst movies in anyone's memories. From their sobad they'recompletely awful SyFy originals like 'Mega Piranha vs. Who Gives a Damn' to their appalling 'mockbusters' like 'Transmorphers' The Asylum has been able to set a new bar for just how low one can go in the film industry. And yet no matter how deep they dig into the septic systems of their imaginations somehow these scam artists manage to just keep on going. This time their target is the exorcist subgenre especially the recent success 'The Last Exorcism.' With 'Anneliese The Exorcist Tapes' director Jude Gerard Prest which is more likely than not a pseudonym since no one would want to put their real name to a film like this and his team of misfits flat out lie telling the world well the small damned percentage of the world that is unfortunate to witness this disaster that what this film is actually real. Yeah real garbage. From almost the first frame 'Anneliese' tries to be simply a compilation of what made other exorcist movies work but they just assemble their own moronic versions of those elements. Even the opening cloned almost completely a scene from William Friedkin's 'The Exorcist.' I suppose the writers thought this could pass because of their claim that the 'Anneliese' videos inspired Friedkin's movie. . . even though 'The Exorcist' was inspired by the book by William Peter Blatty. . . which was inspired by an entirely different exorcism of a boy. 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' is the film that was actually based however loosely on the events of the Anneliese Michel incident.Friedkin's groundbreaking horror masterpiecce isn't the only film borrowed from for this production. We also revisit some exciting eh. . . scenes from 'The Last Exorcism' 'Paranormal Activity' which was already mockbusted by The Asylum with 'Paranormal Entity' and a few others. Strangely enough the film even stretches to copy itself by randomly flashing back to its own scenes only moments after those scenes happen almost as if the crew was so proud of their work that they just had show it twice. . . but that can't be true so they were probably bloating the film to hit a reasonable runtime since they didn't have the brains to actually flesh out a full script.Visually the film is just a mess. To bring realism maybe? to the otherwise ridiculous creation three different cameras are used throughout. . . or just the same camera with three different filters black  white sepia  super 8 grainy. Add this to the eyeraping cinematography and 'Anneliese' is about as enjoyable to look at Alex DeLarge's forced theatre trip in 'A Clockwork Orange.' Luckily most viewers will probably spend more time watching the clock waiting for the movie to end thanks to the excruciatingly grueling pace of the writer's amateurish script which was probably the only thing worse about this movie than the directing editing and cinematography.Final Verdict 110.AP3".

	schema:reviewBody "I never came across a DVD called Anneliese The Exorcist Tapes. But I do came across Paranormal Entity 3. And let that be the same flick. Pure commercially chosen that title but be advised. It had nothing to do with paranormal entities. It is in fact a pure possession flick. It was based on the story of Anneliese Michel.Anneliese Michel 21 September 1952  1 July 1976 was a German Catholic woman who was said to be possessed by demons and subsequently underwent an exorcism. The case has been labelled as a misidentification of mental illness negligence abuse and religious hysteria. When she was sixteen she suffered a severe convulsion and was diagnosed as having epilepsy. Soon she began hallucinating while praying. In 1973 she suffered from depression and began to hear voices telling her that she was damned and would rot in hell. On 1 July 1976 Anneliese died in her sleep. The autopsy report stated the cause of death as malnutrition and dehydration from almost a year of semistarvation while the rites of exorcism were performed. She weighed 68 pounds 30.91 kilograms. Three motion pictures The Exorcism of Emily Rose 2005 Requiem 2006 and the Asylum film Anneliese The Exorcist Tapes are loosely based on Michel's story.Horror buffs will have noticed one word The Asylum. Again Asylum films tried to pick in on the success of a blockbuster. sadly they failed. The flick has nothing to offer. The first second I laughed out loud already by seeing a socalled German. What a clich that was. Not only that they tried to let English actors to speak English with a German accent. It sounded like inspector Clouseau...Further we have a lot of priests just talking and stating in front of the camera about Anneliese. Anneliese herself didn't look possessed. She looked like a girl waking up with her eye makeup still on. Nobody really was convincing. What was interesting was the use of real audio footage of Anneliese but sadly they edited it 3 times into the flick. A very annoying turkey maybe if you watch it pssed and proud you do will have a laugh. The only thing that it had in common with the paranormal entity franchise was the nudity boobs in it. And they do distract you from the story. Maybe her juggs were possessed?Gore 05 Nudity 055 Effects 05 Story 15 Comedy 25".

	schema:reviewBody "Anneliese The Exorcist Tapes is another one of these claim to be true footage accounts of the now famous Anneliese Michel exorcism that was also portrayed in The Exorcism of Emily Rose. The movies shows this from three points of view. A black and white security cam a regular cam that was standard color and finally a crappy camera with a sepia colored tone that they used the majority of the movie which annoyed the hell out of me. they have shots where they took the real audio from the actual Annaliese and play the audio tapes with just a static background. The opening scene where Anneliese pisses on the floor and licks it up was pretty shocking and probably the highlight of the movie.".

The movies shows this from three points of view. A black and white security cam a regular cam that was standard color and finally a crappy camera with a sepia colored tone that they used the majority of the movie which annoyed the hell out of me. they have shots where they took the real audio from the actual Annaliese and play the audio tapes with just a static background. The opening scene where Anneliese pisses on the floor and licks it up was pretty shocking and probably the highlight of the movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "Anneliese The Exorcist Tapes 2011 12 out of 4 The Asylum's attempt to cash in on countless exorcism films including THE LAST EXORCISM which this is a mockbuster of. Not only that but the studio tries to claim that the true case of Anneliese Michel a German girl who was believed to have been possessed by the devil is featured in this found footage horror movie. In the film we see Anneliese Nikki Muller as she goes through various physical and psychological situations and the locals priests feels she's possessed while the doctors from the hospital thinks she's just mentally troubled. The footage will let the truth be known. ANNELIESE THE EXORCIST TAPES is an extremely bad movie that lacks any real imagination and in the end its 90minutes just go by so slowly that you'll wish you were the one possessed by the devil. I think a lot of the blame has to go towards the actual story which simply gives us nothing new or interesting. We never really get to know any of the characters. We never care about any of the characters and there's not a single second where any of them don't come off more annoying than anything else. It also doesn't help that the director filmed everything so bland that there's just never anything that pulls you into the film. The lack of any real suspense or drama is just the death nail. Even worse is that there's not a single frame where you feel as if you're watching some sort of found footage as it's clear what we're seeing isn't real for one but it's clearly also not shot in 1976 which is the date it takes place. There are two things that kept me from giving this a BOMB rating and one is the performance as Muller. I thought she actually did a pretty good job in the part but it's just a shame her talents were in such a worthless movie. The second thing that worked is that the film thankfully got so bad to where I got a couple big laughs. One came from the horrendous German accents and the other came from a scene where the possessed girl tries to sexually assault one of the priests.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 2003 Russian oil magnate Mikhael Khodorkovsky was arrested on charges of fraud by the Putin government. The owner of oil giant Yukos one of the largest companies to emerge from the privatisation of Russian state assets during the 1990s Khodorkovsky later had a prominent and public role as a financier of the Russian opposition in the 2000s. Quickly found guilty the oligarch was sentenced to nine years in prison later extended to twelve. From prison Khodorkovsky has waged a campaign in Western media to raise awareness of the injustice of his incarceration and the corruption of the Russian political system that permitted such a turn of events.Cyril Tuschi's 'Khodorkovsky' is partbiopic partcriminal investigation seeking to uncover against substantial odds both who the real Khodorkovsky was and whether his wellpublicised trial was political posturing on the behest of Putin or an accurate reflection of the murky dealings of the Russian oil industry  an industry borne out of the questionable auctions of the Yeltsin government in the 1990s. Khodorkovsky in a manner similar to his fellow oligarchs acquired Yukos in 1995 at one such state auction paying well below the market value. Soon acquiring a reputation for being a perennial corporate governance abuser Yukos and its billionaire owner underwent a volte face at the turn of the millennium.

	onyx:emotionText "In 2003 Russian oil magnate Mikhael Khodorkovsky was arrested on charges of fraud by the Putin government. The owner of oil giant Yukos one of the largest companies to emerge from the privatisation of Russian state assets during the 1990s Khodorkovsky later had a prominent and public role as a financier of the Russian opposition in the 2000s. Quickly found guilty the oligarch was sentenced to nine years in prison later extended to twelve. From prison Khodorkovsky has waged a campaign in Western media to raise awareness of the injustice of his incarceration and the corruption of the Russian political system that permitted such a turn of events.Cyril Tuschi's 'Khodorkovsky' is partbiopic partcriminal investigation seeking to uncover against substantial odds both who the real Khodorkovsky was and whether his wellpublicised trial was political posturing on the behest of Putin or an accurate reflection of the murky dealings of the Russian oil industry  an industry borne out of the questionable auctions of the Yeltsin government in the 1990s. Khodorkovsky in a manner similar to his fellow oligarchs acquired Yukos in 1995 at one such state auction paying well below the market value. Soon acquiring a reputation for being a perennial corporate governance abuser Yukos and its billionaire owner underwent a volte face at the turn of the millennium. As it's transparency began to encourage immediate investment. the share price saw a swift upward turn. Simultaneously on the advice of an American PR firm Khodorkovsky launched Open Russia' investing 100 million in Russian education projects. By 2002 Khodorkovsky was both the world's richest man under 40 and the symbol for sound civic governance in a Russia still blighted by corruption and inequality.Though rich and powerful enough to brush shoulders with the oil magnates of the world Khodorkovsky's mistake was to take that attitude that perceived arrogance and impose it upon a Russian political elite not yet ready to accept their subservience to the new business elite.

	schema:headline " awful film with an awful myopic message";
	schema:reviewBody "This piece of Michael Mooreesque propaganda with the same kind of whiny sentimental voiceover is an absolute load of nonsense.Most Russians know Khodorkovsky as a crook a bandit and a criminal who made billions from stealing natural resources from the country during the chaos and lawlessness of the 80s and 90s in Russia. Cyril Tuschi's attempts to portray him as a martyr for freedom and democracy in Russia is disgusting. The nods towards a more balanced account are distinctly feeble quoting Khodorkovsky talking about breaking 'ethical standards from today's point of view' no st the former Yukos lawyer talking about Khodorkovsky helping create the very system that condemned him relating his possible connection to the killing of the mayor quickly dismissed by the next interviewee 'I hope. I am almost certain that he wasn't involved in this. I have serious doubts about some other Russian oligarchs'. Why does he hope and what makes him almost certain? What's his evidence that one of the most successful oligarchs wasn't while many others were? The film never interrogates this point. Khodorkovsky paid just 309 million for Yukos  in an auction held by his own bank  by 2003 it was worth 45 billion. This was hardly down to Khodorkovsky's management genius. No one got that far in that period in Russia and in so short a space of time without doing the worst possible things to get there. If practically everyone was doing it how did one of those who was most successful in that era stay largely clear? Just so you are under no illusions as to Tuschi's agendaviewpoint in this film I'll give you a few quotes from an interview that he did with Spiegel Online. In it Tuschi asserts that 'I am an artist not a judge' who is merely 'presenting an interesting film about a unique person' but in response to the very next question says that 'he has an almost transcendental supernatural aura. It is the aura of a martyr'. This film is clearly the portrayal of a hero albeit a flawed one as the best heroes are!  just look at the moment when Tuschi finally meets Khodorkovsky and shakes his hand in awe and the suggestion earlier in the film that Khodorkovsky's earliest thinking and his core was and is influenced by the populist ideals of 'Pavel Korchagin' fighting for the good of the people 'for the people's liberation'. To compare Khodorkovsky to the fictional Korchagin as Tuschi is clearly doing is a laughable disgrace. Khodorkovsky cares nothing for the wellbeing of the Russian people. Until he had political ambitions again for personal gain for which he was imprisoned and his assets seized when did he give two cents about the Russian people or democracy? All of those years of raking in money at the people's expense. He was a crook amongst crooks who lost out in the power struggle nothing more. The attempts by people like Tuschi or The Guardian in the UK to turn him into a martyr in Russia's struggle for freedom is pathetic. The film is too busy fawning over Khodorkovsky to provide any insight at all into the nuance and detail and context of what is going on. Tuschi came and went with the same lazy preconceptions about Khodorkovsky and his role in Russian society and he expects us to do the same. He seems to blindly accept what his interview subjects say subjects who are almost exclusively former and current associates of Khodorkovsky. He also employs Michael Moore's patented technique of bursting in on officials unannounced demanding they answer difficult questions on the spot then instantly interpreting their refusal as them evading him because they have something to hide.Here are a few particularly egregious snapshots of how idiotic this film getsin a weird and creepy black and white animation he has Khodorkovsky swimming across a swimming pool of gold coins towards a sign that says 'Open Russia'.in an interview Leonid Nevzlin a multimillionaire if not billionaire former Yukos executive in exile who poor guy complains of all the sunshine in Israel has the cheek to say 'We need some money. We need compensation. Not because we don't have money fortunately we saved some money but because they stole a lot of money our part of Yukos oil company. So why we should forgive them for this? They should pay.' The film makes no mention of the irony of this. The Russian government's seizing of assets is repeatedly commented on and yet no mention is made of how and in what context the Yukos managers made their money in the first place.the melancholic footage and voiceover of the now largely empty 'Yukos Compound' with its massive walls and mansions. 'Five of seven manager's houses are empty. Otherwise only the employees remain who keep the park and pool in order heating the empty houses and sweeping a garage for 50 vehicles that now stands empty too'. Need I add anything to his own words? Is Tuschi listening to what he's saying here? What exactly is he mourning for god's sake? Yukos' former lawyer complaining about the state 'tricking the oligarchsthe oligarchs  they got no rights.' Lets all weep for the injustices suffered by the poor billionaires when the Russian government reasserted its authority after they had made so much money by opportunistically grabbing at a cutprice any industries that were lying around after the collapse of the Soviet Union. You know who had no rights? The ordinary people who were left with a disintegrating state plundered by bandits whose savings and pensions were repeatedly wiped out who lived in abject poverty and chaos while people from the Yukos cartel amongst several others drove by them in their black Mercedes with tinted windows and appropriated police sirens.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the movie the writerproducer fails to point out that the sale of YUKOS OIL's assets and other assets sold to the oligarchs was a move by Yeltsin to protect the Russian economy from being owned by business outside Russia. If the assets placed in the auction had been offered for their true value only large corporations outside of Russia would have been able to afford them. In order to have them owned by Russian businesses they were offered for rock bottom prices. Only a few business people in Russia had the assets to acquire businesses such as Yukos. Whether it was stealing from the Russian people is a moral question that is difficult to answer since the practical reason for the sales was so complex. Prior to the sale the government owned all the assets so did the government steal from the people by controlling all the assets? Did the government provide its citizens the benefits of those resources or did government officials plunder the assets too. According to continuing reports from analysts who study Russian politics Putin has amassed a fortune estimated at 60 billion during his terms in office. Did he acquire those assets through corruption or legitimate means? At least when business people own assets the people they employ benefit by receiving a salary. In the U.S. the discrepancy between what CEOs earn and what the average worker earns represents a gap of about 475. Some people in the U.S. view CEOs as stealing from the shareholders. If the documentary had presented some of these facts so viewers could see that this is not a black and white issue the movie would have provided a more substantive explanation of what happened during the 90s and how Russia and Khordorkvsky changed  from a country that had begun to move toward democracy to one with an ironfisted leader who appears to be as corrupt as most Russians view Khordorkvsky. As a documentarian myself I know it is difficult to present this complex subject in a brief and interesting film. I do think the writerproducer tried because the movie talks about Khordorkvsky's taking advantage of the system which at the time was totally legal when he bought Yukos to the Khordorkvsky who was supporting the opposition movement. Whether he was doing it for political gain wanting to be president I doubt. Recent events show that was not the case. His public statement that the president needed to do something about corruption viewed as the catalyst for his arrest indicates that he was attempting to present his newfound capitalistic business approach as a better way for Russian to operate  to attract foreign investment. Whether it was arrogant of him to speak publicly to the president is an open question but in the U.S. people challenge the president constantly to fix what's wrong with the country. One has to decide  was Khordorkvsky being arrogant or was he operating under the assumption that government can affect changes in problems facing the country as is expected in a democratic country?".

Some of the most implausible aspects of this fictionalized account  the delicious surprise twist at the end  are TRUE! One of my film guides informed me that 5 Fingers won the '53 Golden Globe for its excellent screenplay. The highlights of the witty script include the interplay of James Mason as the suave valet I couldn't help rooting for and Danielle Darrieux as the penniless yet glamourously seductive Countess Staviska. The acting of these two is topnotch the supporting cast is consistently strong and the Turkish location shooting gives it body. And the direction by Joseph Mankiewicz is solid. This is a film about which you will ask as I did Why Haven't I Heard of THIS one Before!?!".

One of my film guides informed me that 5 Fingers won the '53 Golden Globe for its excellent screenplay. The highlights of the witty script include the interplay of James Mason as the suave valet I couldn't help rooting for and Danielle Darrieux as the penniless yet glamourously seductive Countess Staviska. The acting of these two is topnotch the supporting cast is consistently strong and the Turkish location shooting gives it body. And the direction by Joseph Mankiewicz is solid. This is a film about which you will ask as I did Why Haven't I Heard of THIS one Before!?!";

	schema:reviewBody "Supposedly based on a true story a valet uses his position at British embassy to steal WWII secrets to sell to the Germans.What a superbly tight script that stays on the compelling track the whole time. We watch lowly valet Diello Mason use nothing but wits and guts to outmaneuver both the British and the Germans. He's not a sympathetic lead character always unusual for a Hollywood production TCF. But you can't help admiring his ability to outwit the professionals even if he is completely selfcentered. I get the feeling Diello sees himself as a natural born aristocrat denied that position by the fortunes of birth. So by golly he's going to use those talents to get the wealth and position he deserves but which European society has denied him.Mason is simply superb in a tailormade part. He projects both the icy intelligence and curt politeness that the role requires. I sweated a bucket load when the cleaning lady rummages around the closet while Diello photographs embassy secrets. If she finds the power switch he's toast. Great scene. Note too how there're no obvious good guysbad guys also unusual for a WWII drama. The British are slightly favored but at least the Germans aren't caricatured. It's more like one opportunist Diello is exploiting both sides impartially and they're both after him.Then too what guy wouldn't lose his head over the delectable Darrieux even a guy as calculating as Diello. All of which makes the ending one of the most ironically satisfying in movie annals. I'm betting this was one of the best films to come out of that spare movie year of 1952. So if you haven't seen it do.".

	schema:reviewBody "This forgotten film brilliantly directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz is one of the best spy films we have seen in recent memory. The film holds the viewer in suspense up the last frame. Mr. Mankiewicz was working on the fine screen play written by Michael Wilson based on a real incident told by L. C. Moyzisch a German officer who is a key player in the story.The film opens in Ankara Turkey's capital during WWII. The place is swarming with spies and intrigues. We are taken to a reception where we encounter Countess Anna a beautiful woman of uncertain age who is living below her means in the country. Anna asks for monetary help to a German officer who she has met before. At this point we meet Diello a valet to the English ambassador to Turkey. Diello has a proposal for Moyzisch a German connected to the embassy. He proposes a deal where he will cooperate in spying for the Germans in exchange of heavy amounts of money.Since Diello needs a front Countess Anna becomes the a desirable object for this man's plans in how to conduct the business. Thus the impoverished countess agrees to the plan. Countess Anna becomes a hostess who gathers in her new elegant surroundings the cream of the diplomatic society. The countess goes along with the scheme but at the same time she deeply resents the idea of having Diello a man that is not from her circle and background be treated as her equal.The film works because what we see is what really happened. This being a real story is not something that came out of some writer's imagination. On the contrary we are completely astounded in the way this Diello was able to fool his superiors at the embassy. We watch as Diello goes about the business of spying right at the ambassador's office without being caught.There are two ironic twists to the story that come as complete surprises to us. In a way because one is not expecting the first one is the betrayal to Diello by the heartless countess and the second one is at the conclusion of the film. This last one is something that keeps us laughing along with Diello and in turn to the woman who double crossed him.James Mason is excellent as Diello. Mr. Mason was an actor that always delivered. In his English films as well as some of his Hollywood movies this actor projected such a powerful figure. His method of working always amazes because his performances always build up to unexpected results. The film belongs to Mr. Mason who is terrific and charismatic.Danielle Darrieux one of the best French film actresses of all times makes a delightful appearance as Countess Anna. She transforms herself from a the woman trying to eke out a living to the sophisticated lady of a society she felt comfortable with because she was born into it.The supporting roles are quite good. The surprise was Herbert Berghof one of the most famous acting teachers of all times making a rare appearance.5 Fingers has a great black and white cinematography by Norman Brodine who captures some of those Turkish locales in all their splendor. The film score by Bernard Herrmann adds another dimension to the film. Thanks to Mr. Mankiewicz this is a film that will please his admirers.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILER WARNING SPOILER WARNING...when the countess doublecrossed James Mason? She would spy on the Germans she would help Mason's valet character Diello spy on the British. Like Diello said money was like electric light to her. She gave no thought to the source until it was shut off. And in their last conversation it was obvious to her that Diello considered the money he made from spying to be his money not theirs. Diello's big mistake during all of this is an underlying belief that there is any honor among thieves and not realizing this is not a business venture as far as any of the parties are concerned.The film is about a valet at the British embassy in neutral Turkey using the lack of any strong security measures at that embassy to steal Allied secrets and sell them to the Germans amassing a large fortune in just a couple of months. It is true he wants a life of leisure in a peaceful place but he is also in love with the now impoverished Countess Anna Staviska. And he knows she has a mercenary soul and though she might have been attracted to him when he was her late husband's valet she would never give herself to any man unless he had wealth.Postwar thrillers about WWII were usually much better than anything made during the war because they could be honest about the mercenary people who had no patriotism. Such people always exist. However I did note that the movie made a point of Diello saying that he was actually born in Albania not England. This was supposedly based on a true story so I do not know if that was the truth or just added to keep the British from looking bad.Mason and the countess get the best lines of the film but the Germans get a bunch too as they are shown  at least at the embassy  thinking more for themselves than you would give them credit.This is full of twists and turns and do watch this to the very end because the final irony is enough even to find Diello's funny bone.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the period between 1918  1939 most of the countries in Eastern Europe were notable for the strongman dictatorships that had arisen out of the ashes of the First World War. Except for Czechoslovakia and the doomed Baltic trio of states and Finland and Austria for awhile Poland Hungary Italy and the Balkan states all became dictatorships. One might on the surface have added the former Ottoman Empire now Turkey. Certainly Turkey had some black marks against it the Armenian massacres in the World War and the brutal massacre of Greeks at Smyrna in 1922. But aside from those Turkey surprised everyone. It's strongman leader Mustapha Kemal a.k.a. Kemal Attaturk was determined to make Turkey a strong western country. To this day the military from which Kemal came out of has remained proWestern and been pushing despite difficulties with Armenia Greece the Kurds and Muslim fundamentalists to keep modernizing Turkey. His Kemal's was the only positive spin on a dictatorship from Eastern Europe in that period. Kemal was lucky that he had a keen lieutenant and successor named Ismet Inonu. Ismet was as determined to continue Kemal's goals after his friend's death in 1938. One goal that both of them had discussed and agreed upon was that Turkey was not going to be pulled into any further nonsense that it could not afford to get involved in. This meant that if there was any major war hitting Europe again and both Kemal and Ismet fully knew one was on the way after 1933 Turkey was going to be neutral. This was on the surface surprising and disappointing to the Axis when war came in 1939  1940. Hitler figured that as Turkey had been allied to Germany in World War I it would be allied again in World War II. Actually Kemal and Ismet were less than enchanted by such an idea. Kemal made his reputation as a great military hero by his leadership against the British at Gallipoli. While the German commander Liman Von Sanders took kudos for much of the triumph there Kemal fumed at this  he knew that Von Sanders made several severe blunders that cost Turkish lives and that he looked at the Turks as cannon fodder. Kemal was determined that no Turk would die for Germany again. Ismet swore the same thing.It is for this reason that Turkey is neutral from 1939 to 1945 as De Velera's Eire was also neutral. This meant that the embassies of all the major powers were active in Ankara during the war and that much spy activity was going on there as a result. Hollywood did take notice of it twice as far as I can recall  in 1943 when Warner Brothers made a film of Eric Ambler's 1940 novel BACKGROUND TO DANGER about a German plot to force Turkey into the war as an Axis ally Sidney Greenstreet as the Nazi agent against George Raft as the American one and the 1942 film JOURNEY INTO FEAR where German agents are after an American engineer Joseph Cotton who has been arming Turkish ships. That too was from an Eric Ambler novel.With this as the background you can suddenly understand the story of Operation Cicero. Ulysses Diello James Mason in the film his real name was Bazna is personal valet to the British Ambassador to Turkey Walter Hampden. But he is gifted spy and has proof of it which he takes to the German embassy's espionage chief Moyzisch Oskar Karlweis. Actually the information by itself would not unduly impress Moyzisch it could be a plant for all that but Diello opens the embassy safe while Moyzisch is out of the room. He knows that in Germany since 1933 Hitler's birthday or his date of coming to power are the universal combinations favored in government organizations for their safes.The pieces of information that Cicero the code name for Mason checks out  although there is always a lingering sense of doubt by Moyzisch's higher ups in German intelligence. They continue paying Mason in British pounds he may give them the information but Mason has little faith the Germans are going to win the war. In the meantime the leak has been noticed by British intelligence which sends Michael Rennie to investigate. Soon he begins to concentrate on Mason. Mason feels he still can carry on his espionage business. However Mason has started romancing a Countess Danielle Darrieux whom he once knew as a servant. She may be playing him for a sucker  but even if she is he is determined to carry off the greatest espionage coup of all time. He is aware of some large scale Allied invasion being planned  and a copy of the plans is at the British embassy.The film shows what actually happened. He did get the information regarding Operation Overlord and sold it to the Germans. And their subsequent use of this masterstroke demonstrated again how smart Cicero was in judging German intelligence. It is an exciting spy thriller and on the whole factual. Mason Rennie Darrieux Hampden give pretty good accounts for themselves in this film and Joseph Mankiewicz' script and direction are excellent. A highly worthy film to be seen.".

Like High Noon from the same year it is anything but simple and straightforward in its utterly fascinating and intriguing subtext.The whole point of the liaison between Mason and his prewar employer is that it is motivated by a classridden hatred and desire for revenge on Mason's part resulting in a bitter sense of humiliation experienced by Darrieux. There is no love of any kind lost between them in spite of their mutually fake and passionless kisses. Both characters are completely amoral but Mason is partly redeemed by his scintillating wit and sense of humour.

In 1952 Mank was still firing on all cylinders and with both A Letter To Three Wives and All About Eve under his belt plus two sets of Oscars on his shelves he was able to extract lots of mileage out of this true story of espionage in neutral Turkey during the Second World War. James Mason a fine actor in anyone's book has his work cut out to share a screen with Danielle Darrieux one of France's finest but he contrives to pull out something extra to keep up with her and the result is an acting feast. It's difficult to create suspense when the outcome is known  at least to those who read the book on which it is based  but Mank is up to the task and delivers an allround gem.".

You certainly can't trust the Nazis.The ending in this film comes right out of an Alfred Hitchcock thriller.The film is definitely a taut espionage thriller with James Mason playing a butler in the British embassy who is up to his neck in espionage. Seems he used to work for the Polish Countess Waleska Danielle Dariux until the bombs started falling on Poland and the count had nerve enough to die.The two of them form a relationship where Mason steals top documents for the Nazis and is paid well. Of course the Nazi hooligans never trust him and eventually the film becomes one of who will do him inEngland or Germany?Michael Rennie plays a British agent. Surprising that it takes so long to see what's going on here.This is the ultimate film in deception and duplicity. I can't give it away but Mason as Cicero the spy certainly has an ironic last laugh.".

An added attraction is that it is based on the true story of Albanian Elyesa Bazna code name Cicero who served as valet to the British Ambassadaor in Turkey Sir Hughe Montgomery KnatchbullHugessen if you must know and funneled secret allied documents to the Germans.It's based on the book Operation Cicero by L.C.Moyzisch who was Cicero's German contact. Mason in a superb performance plays Cicero and Danielle Darriex plays Countess Staviska Cicero's treacherous partner. Mason does a wonderful job of making us almost root for the suavely brash spy. Veteran character actor John Wengraf does a great job as Count von Papen and Michael Rennie is Colin Travers the British security agent who is sent in to uncover Cicero. Fine writing and acting all around with a great director Joseph Mankiewicz and the distinctive sounds of Bernard Herrmann's score. There is a wonderful plot twist at the end that is well worth waiting for. Don't miss this underrated gem.".

However by the time he made Five Fingers Mankiewicz was at the end of his contract with Twentieth Century Foxand it sure was an excellent farewell.This movie is based on real events though a few changes were made for cinematic purposes. James Mason plays a valet in the British embassy in Turkey during WWII and he's a completely trusted but totally amoral man. To earn money for his retirement the guy approaches the Nazis and offers to sell them secrets. What is most interesting about this movie is that you see just how stupid the Nazis and the Brits. Despite repeatedly giving them excellent information again and again the Nazis didn't trust it and didn't take advantage of it. As for the Brits you wouldn't think that they'd let an Albanian valet to have such access to secrets! Still it's a very fascinating storyone that is well made and well worth your time.".

The cast is mixed with the best actor Andre Morell wasted in a minor role. There are compensations however as Hammer veteran Michael Ripper dubbed by Christopher Lee as 'face of Hammer' is given is best role as Longbarrow his death is perhaps the dramatic highlight of the movie.In addition 'The Mummy's Shroud' is superior to Hammer's last movie in the series 'The Curse Of The Mummy's Tomb' having a faster pace and sticks better in the memory mainly due to the talents of Gilling. While not vintage Hammer by a long chalk it's a solid Hammer movie which suffers from the 'seen it all before' factor.Oh by the way if you're a Peter Cushing fan you will be disappointed as despite being credited to Cushing in some sources the narrator does not sound remotely like him.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is actually the first Hammer movie about a mummy I've seen in its entirety. And now I want more! Although it's not exactly the most gruesome or most entertaining Hammer effort out there it wasn't a letdown either. THE MUMMY'S SHROUD plays it downright serious to some extend with success on other levels a bit of a failure. Let's start with a few negative points first. As mentioned in other usercomments the prologue knows a poorly staged and acted Egyptian sequence that might have you chuckling because of how cheap the sets look it really looks a bit like a high school stageplay. But nevertheless plotwise that prologue was a necessity to provide the history to the story. Another thing is that the plot relies a lot on the cast to tell the story. Which is good and bad. Good thing is that the whole cast is more than capable when it comes to performances. The bad thing is It results often in too much talking and less thrills and chills. The budget restrictions also show resulting in limited sets. There's only a handful of rooms and a couple of narrow city streets all clearly built on a soundstage. The filmmakers just inserted the same overview establishing shot of the city a couple of times and the viewer should get the impression that the cast is running around in it. All this really isn't a complaint because it works and that's just the way it was shot on a modest budget. It's just that it's clearly noticeable albeit the setdesign was handled with care. The handful of outdoors shots weren't filmed in a real desert of course. You can clearly see it's just a few hills were they tossed around an amount of sand in one shot you can even see some plants in the background that shouldn't normally grow in a desert. Still no complaints because the film shows they did the best they could.Now for the stuff that matters. The story is wellconstructed. Of course it's about a mummy who comes to life and goes on a vengeful rampage to kill off all the cursed people who entered his tomb and placed him in a museum. But the little catch is it's actually a shroud that causes the shrieks and slaughter for he who has it holds the power to resurrect the mummy. Knowing this it's up to the archaeologists and the local police detective to figure out who exactly wants the members of the expedition dead. Sadly the mystery isn't there since the plot really serves up only one possible suspect. But still nothing to nag about because there still is the main attraction The murderous mummy. The first time he comes to life features a memorable closeup shot of his face. The special effects shot where he opens his dusty  crusty eyelids 'animatronics' avant l lettre is effectively creepy. I even rewound that bit because at first I wasn't quite sure what I was looking at until they started to move. The mummy's got strength and he's a real stalker shuffling his way through the streets at night into buildings and bedrooms. The kills are nicely staged and my favorite one involves a jar of acid and a fire. Don't expect anything too graphic though. It might be a Hammer movie but after all it was still the sixties. There's a decent short but satisfying climax in the museum too. It shows us that a mummy's shoulder is firm soil to plant an axe into although it's not likely to stop him.One more thing that made this movie worthwhile watching too. An actress. Maggie Kimberly. I just can't quite put it into words... At first you don't particularly notice her. She's just part of the expedition. But the more screen time she gets in different scenes the more she just demands your attention. She just had a mesmerizing look to her beauty. The more I saw her the more I wanted to see of her. She has gorgeous blond hair always tied together. And at one point I was wishing her to finally let her hair down for it to engulf her shoulders... And then wham! The last scenes has her with her hair down. Ravishing! I just love it when a girl grants my wish. Even in a movie. Anyway I'm going way off topic here. But whatever happened to her as an actress? She only did three movies and a TV episode. Strange...Oh well. Bottom line So far I've never seen a Hammer movie that disappointed me. THE MUMMY'S SHROUD might maybe not make it to the 'Best Of Hammer' list but it sure is a fun watch.".

	schema:headline " Beware the wrath of Prem";
	schema:reviewBody "Mummy movies are notoriously difficult to make interesting. The original Universal film with Boris Karloff succeeded by becoming a dark and dreamy romantic fantasy. Hammer's fullblooded remake in 1959 gave us a powerful yet sympathetic Mummy portrayed by Christopher Lee. Beyond those two most mummy films have been of middling quality. This is one of the better ones though it surely has its faults.The lengthy historical prologue has been complained about by many but I think it it necessary to show the great loyalty and devotion that the slave Prem has towards his young master Kahtobey. It gives him a sympathetic edge as he did everything to honor his master both in life and death. This aura of sympathy is in all of Hammer's Mummy films to some degree. Lee's Kharis suffered horribly for true love while RaAntef in Curse of the Mummy's Tomb was a noble soul terribly betrayed. Prem fits well with his predecessors.The reanimated Prem is little more than a slave of the fanatical Hasmid and his crazed mother. But when he strikes it's with a lot of violence in some very wellcrafted death scenes. He crushes one character's head like an eggshell off screen but we can imagine the gruesome details splatters another with burning acid before setting him on fire strangles another before dashing his brains out on a wall and wraps up another in a bed sheet before tossing him out a window to the street far below! Now THAT is a violent mummy and one capable of more than just simply strangling people.Prem's unique look is based on actual Egyptian mummies. Some find it disappointing...I do not. One of the best scenes is when the mummy slowly opens its crusty eyelids. Prem is also mighty tough. He gets singed with acid giving him a nice smoky look hacked with an axe and shot to hell at close range without much effect. When destruction finally comes to the mummy it comes in a most unique and gruesome fashion.Most Hammer films boast good performances and there are several worth noting here. John Phillips hits just the right note as the arrogant and cowardly Stanley Preston. One of the more subtle horrors of the film is his completely loveless and emotionally dead relationship with his wife. Just before his meeting with the Mummy Preston must realize that he will be missed by no one. Elisabeth Sellars as Mrs. Preston gives one of the most coldblooded and emotionally detached performances I've seen. Roger Delgado is great as the sinister Hasmid unleashing an amazingly perfect stream of Arabic gibberish. Delgado would perfect his evil as The Master in Dr. Who. Another wild performance is given by Catherine Lacey as the demented Haiti the fortune teller. Never has any fortune teller delighted in predicting her customer's deaths as much as Haiti.One black mark against the movie is the criminal misuse of Andre Morell as Sir Basil. Morell was a terrific actor so memorable in Plague of the Zombies Hound of the Baskervilles and the littleseen Cash On Demand but here he makes little to no impression. Something which I blame more on the script and the director than Morell himself.Maggie Kimberly is quite stunning as Claire. She looks rather average at first but the more she is in peril the more attractive she becomes.The actor who really walks off with the movie is Hammer mainstay Michael Ripper. What a versatile actor he was. As the meek and suffering lackey of Preston's he makes for a perfect milksop. We feel an overwhelming sympathy for this simple character and his death is a brutal shock.There are parts where the movie lags particularly in the opening desert scenes but once Prem is awakened the action never flags and the movie builds to a powerful and actionpacked climax. In the end Hammer gave as much life as they could to the tired mummy concept with The Mummy's Shroud and the film should satisfy anyone looking for escapist horror.".

Just before his meeting with the Mummy Preston must realize that he will be missed by no one. Elisabeth Sellars as Mrs. Preston gives one of the most coldblooded and emotionally detached performances I've seen. Roger Delgado is great as the sinister Hasmid unleashing an amazingly perfect stream of Arabic gibberish. Delgado would perfect his evil as The Master in Dr. Who. Another wild performance is given by Catherine Lacey as the demented Haiti the fortune teller. Never has any fortune teller delighted in predicting her customer's deaths as much as Haiti.One black mark against the movie is the criminal misuse of Andre Morell as Sir Basil. Morell was a terrific actor so memorable in Plague of the Zombies Hound of the Baskervilles and the littleseen Cash On Demand but here he makes little to no impression. Something which I blame more on the script and the director than Morell himself.Maggie Kimberly is quite stunning as Claire. She looks rather average at first but the more she is in peril the more attractive she becomes.The actor who really walks off with the movie is Hammer mainstay Michael Ripper. What a versatile actor he was. As the meek and suffering lackey of Preston's he makes for a perfect milksop. We feel an overwhelming sympathy for this simple character and his death is a brutal shock.There are parts where the movie lags particularly in the opening desert scenes but once Prem is awakened the action never flags and the movie builds to a powerful and actionpacked climax. In the end Hammer gave as much life as they could to the tired mummy concept with The Mummy's Shroud and the film should satisfy anyone looking for escapist horror.";

Its just a monster movie of the Saturday matine or late night channel surfing variety. Nothing to write to Oscar about.

	schema:reviewBody "Cairo 1920 A team of British archaeologists lead by Sir Basil Walden ANDRE MORELL and financed by the stuffy and selfcentred multimillionaire business tycoon Stanley Preston JOHN PHILIPS discover the tomb of an ancient Egyptian prince called KahToBey. They remove his mummy plus some artifacts from the tomb with the intention of shipping them back to the British museum. However they ignored the warnings of the tomb's guardian Hasmid Ali ROGER DELGADO who told them that they would all die if they desecrated the tomb. True to his word Hasmid Ali revives the mummy of KahToBey's servant Prem EDDIE POWELL using the words of death written upon KahToBey's shroud and it sets out to murder the members of the expedition team one by one.Hammer's mummy franchise was never that strong from the word go. The main problem for the scriptwriters was that once the mummy came back to life  they were never sure what to do with him and in practically every film he just went on the predictable murder spree as is the case here. Plotwise THE MUMMY'S SHROUD is more or less a rerun of Hammer's THE MUMMY 1959 only this time Christopher Lee's stunt double Eddie Powell plays the mummy for what I imagine to be economy reasons for they had somebody who could both do the acting stuff and the stunts as well. It must be said that the mummy is a pretty emotionless character here and Powell couldn't convey the emotion that Lee had done so ingeniously under all his heavy makeup.Nevertheless despite it's limitations in those departments THE MUMMY'S SHROUD is still an entertaining little second feature  it went out as a double bill with the studio's marvelous FRANKENSTEIN CREATED WOMAN in June 1967. Director John Gilling who declared this to be one of his worst films actually manages to revitalise as best he can what he himself called a worn out theme. The film was the last picture that Hammer shot at the legendary Bray Studios in Berkshire and despite the fact that the picture rarely ever got outside the studio gate apart from one day's location shooting in a quarry in Gerrards Cross made to look like the Egyptian desert the film has a nice sense of place thanks to the atmospheric and economical sets of Bernard Robinson and the lensing of Arthur Grant who turns in some of his best ever camerawork for Hammer the viewer can actually feel himselfherself in Egypt although you know that you are actually within a few miles of London rather than Cairo. Good performances too especially from Michael Ripper as Preston's publicity assistant Longbarrow who is truly a sympathetic portrayal of the puton dogsbody of a stuffy and selfish businessman. In addition his character becomes all the more poignant since he meets an incredibly brutal demise at the hands of Prem who wraps him in a sheet and throws him head first out of a top floor hotel room window. Catherine Lacey is enjoyably bad and over the top as the fortune teller Haiti who helps her son Hasmid Ali ROGER DELGADO to lure the victims into the path of the mummy. Interestingly Delgado a very good character actor enjoyed fame as Dr Who's archnemesis The Master on television but tragically he was killed in a car crash in 1973.All in all THE MUMMY'S SHROUD is a better than average secondfeature with better production values than one would normally expect and some fine performances and neat period atmosphere. An underrated Hammer horror which shows that a lot can be achieved within a low budget with good technicians and actors.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like almost all the Hammer movies I saw this movie on TV on a Saturday afternoon when I was 8. I wasn't scared by it but I was entertained by it. The movie begins in ancient Egypt when the Pharaoh's wife gives birth and dies. The Pharaoh dedicates everything to his son the future Pharaoh KahtoBey but little did he know that his brother was planning to take over. On one night the palace was attacked by the Pharaoh's brother. While the attack KahtoBey's bodyguard Kremm escaped with the Pharaoh's son to the desert. Later KartoBey dies in the desert and his bodyguard mummifies him and covers him with the sacred shroud. In the 1920 an expedition is sent to find the tomb of KartoBey. The expedition is led by Sir Basil Walden played by Andre Morell Archaeologist and son of the financier Paul Preston played by David Buck and linguist Claire de Sangre played by Maggie Kimberly but there is nothing known about the expedition or the members. The financier Stanley Preston Played by John Phillips orders a search party. While in the desert the Archeologists are trapped in a sand storm but after the storm settles they find a cave and inside they find a mad man speaking some kind of dialect warning them to keep away. Obviously they didn't listen later they are found by the search party and among them is the financier S. Preston who had come to ensure his investment on the expedition. Soon they find that the cave is the tomb of the Pharaoh's son. They find KartoBey and they take him to a museum but the shroud that accompanied the mummy mysteriously disappears. Then one by one the members of the expedition are been killed by a mysterious force. This is a traditional mummy movie explorers find tomb and are later hunted by the wrapped mummy. Nothing is new about it but it has an interesting story and characters are well developed. The actors take it seriously and this makes the story believable. This movie brings back great memories when movie didn't need CGI or complicated stories to make them entertaining. If you are a fan of classic horror from the 50s and 60s this you will definitely enjoy. So on a Saturday night order a pizza and some beers and enjoy Hammer's legacy of horror.".

On one night the palace was attacked by the Pharaoh's brother. While the attack KahtoBey's bodyguard Kremm escaped with the Pharaoh's son to the desert. Later KartoBey dies in the desert and his bodyguard mummifies him and covers him with the sacred shroud. In the 1920 an expedition is sent to find the tomb of KartoBey. The expedition is led by Sir Basil Walden played by Andre Morell Archaeologist and son of the financier Paul Preston played by David Buck and linguist Claire de Sangre played by Maggie Kimberly but there is nothing known about the expedition or the members. The financier Stanley Preston Played by John Phillips orders a search party. While in the desert the Archeologists are trapped in a sand storm but after the storm settles they find a cave and inside they find a mad man speaking some kind of dialect warning them to keep away. Obviously they didn't listen later they are found by the search party and among them is the financier S. Preston who had come to ensure his investment on the expedition. Soon they find that the cave is the tomb of the Pharaoh's son. They find KartoBey and they take him to a museum but the shroud that accompanied the mummy mysteriously disappears. Then one by one the members of the expedition are been killed by a mysterious force. This is a traditional mummy movie explorers find tomb and are later hunted by the wrapped mummy. Nothing is new about it but it has an interesting story and characters are well developed. The actors take it seriously and this makes the story believable. This movie brings back great memories when movie didn't need CGI or complicated stories to make them entertaining. If you are a fan of classic horror from the 50s and 60s this you will definitely enjoy. So on a Saturday night order a pizza and some beers and enjoy Hammer's legacy of horror.";

	schema:headline " This film is a hoot!";
	schema:reviewBody "The mummy was the creature of the month on Turner Classic Movies during October and this was one of the films shown as part of that event. TCM host Ben Mankiewicz was almost apologetic as he admitted that there was nothing really special about this entry as the plot was pretty much derivative of so many of the other Mummy films  there is a violated tomb a curse and a mummy back from the dead for revenge etc.However this one is a regular riot and it is very unintentionally funny. First off it starts out somewhat like The Lion King. There is a tale of a Pharaoh who has a son rather late in life  actually Pharaoh looks all of 30  and how he spends so much time on his new family he doesn't realize his younger brother is planning to usurp the throne. Pharaoh is killed by his brother but Pharaoh's faithful servant Prem takes Pharaoh's young son KahtoBey into exile. Prem may be loyal but he is woefully lacking in logistics skill. For he takes the boy Into the desert apparently with lots of animal skins and heavy furniture ??? but little food or water. So the story talks about how the other servants slowly die of exposure. But they don't. They die  on screen  about ten feet and ten seconds apart from one another. Honestly it's like a Monty Python skit. Then KahtoBey dies Prem buries him and then he dies.So now we are in present day and Englishman Stanley Preston is sponsoring an expedition into the desert to find the actual tomb of KahtoBey and prove that the mummy they have had for some time is NOT KahtoBey but instead Prem. This begs the question if Prem died alone and last AND in exile and hiding who was it that mummified him? This has to be done shortly after death you know. Another plot hole left open. Of course the expedition finds the tomb and the young prince under the mummy's shroud. But first they find a sword yielding guard of the tomb  in the middle of the desert. Hey is this guy just sitting around in the wilderness waiting for someone to violate the tomb? Nice work if you can get it.So the expedition brings the boy king's body back to the museum and puts it right next to the mummy of Prem. Well Stanley Preston turns out to be a real jerk. He has the head of the expedition he backed Sir Basil Walden unjustly committed so he can take credit for his work. But then everybody who desecrated the tomb starts showing up dead  and dead in novel ways. And worse the Egyptian police insist the surviving members of the expedition stay in town in case they want to question them concerning the killings. This is seeming less and less likely since they are all being murdered by  well guess who.The most subtle member of the cast is the actress playing Mrs. Preston. She always has this faint but evil grin on her face like she knows her husband is a jerk and is enjoying watching him sweat and can't wait for it to be his turn with death. But she never really SAYS any of this.This would only rate 4 or maybe 5 stars on a generous day because of plot holes in a thin plot to begin with generic acting by generic actors and absolutely zero atmosphere. But the unintentional camp causes it to rise to a six. Honestly I never really got why Hammer horror was that successful other than the sheer volume of their output except that when Cushing or Lee showed up it was always a pleasure. But this is one that is funny enough that it is worth sitting through at least once.".

As it so happens the young boy was forced to flee into the desert with a loyal servant named Prem Dickie Owen because of intrigue within the Pharaoh's family. Unfortunately the Egyptian desert proves too much for the young boy and KahToBey is buried by Prem and a curse is placed upon anyone who might disturb his master's tomb. As luck would have it the archaeological expedition finds the tomband brings the body of Kahtobey back to the nearest Egyptian citywhere the wealthy financier of the expedition named Stanley Preston John Phillips takes all of the credit. What he doesn't count on however is the mummified body of Prem being brought back to life by the ancestral guardian of the tomb who then orders the mummy to kill all of those who dared to desecrate the sacred resting place of KahToBey. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film pretty much shared the same plot and formula as any number of mummy films made prior to it and as a result there really isn't much here than hasn't been seen before. Even so it was an okay movie for the most part and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Mummy's Shroud is far from an awful film I've yet to see an unwatchable Hammer film even their lesser work. It is however an uneven film with a number of strengths and an even number of big weaknesses and one of Hammer's least accomplished.It looks good some of the editing lacks tightness sometimes and the Mummy effects are not very good but the photography is solid and often wonderful especially in the final thirty minutes the lighting is suitably eerie and the sets give a sense of time and place very well while also looking great. The music score thunders thrillingly and doesn't feel stock and overbearing fitting with the atmosphere appropriately. The murders are inventive and quite grisly while the first murder is the one with the most punch the most memorable being Longbarrow's. While the best The Mummy's Shroud gets is the final thirty minutes which is very entertaining and legitimately scary.Casting and actingwise it is a rather mixed bag with a few coming off well. The best performance comes from Michael Ripper I appreciated that his role was more substantial in comparison to some of his other roles and he is excellent in it the tragic nature of the character Longbarrow was so poignantly done and had such pathos that it was easy to feel sympathy for him. John Phillips also stands out as a suitably loathsome villain while Barbara Sellars matches him more than ideally the interplay between Phillips is very effectively played by both. David Buck is an appealing hero. Catherine Lacey tries too hard sometimes but it is clear that she was having fun and she is enjoyable to fun as one of the film's more colourful characters.Others don't fare so well. Roger Delgardo has a tendency to overcompensate that it takes one out of the film his tongueincheek comedic nature too much out of place. Andre Morell was a reliable actor but is completely wasted no matter how hard he tried to give some serious depth to his character. As truly attractive Maggie Kimberly looks her acting is very overtheatrical and melodramatic and it does hurt the film sometimes. Lastly the Mummy of the title is badly disadvantaged by the truly laughable and fake look it hasthe Egyptians in the opening sequence are also very poorly made up its far too late and far too short screen time and Eddie Powell'seven more lumbering and anaemic than the worst of Lon Chaney Jnr's interpretation emotionless and unmenacing performance.The film takes far too long to get going with an overlongdid it really need to be seven minutes? and not always relevant opening scene with the backstory rather unnecessary. Despite the distinguished delivery the narration was not really needed and it should have been a case of more show less tell. The script is very stiff and rambling with a lot of talk that doesn't do anywhere. The first half is also let down by its draggy pacing noticeable lack of suspense and horror and a very overfamiliar story with a few subplots that either lead nowhere add little or both.All in all an uneven film and one of Hammer's lesser and least accomplished films but by all means watchable especially for the final thirty minutes and Ripper's performance. 510 Bethany Cox".

Michael Ripper is also quite good as a doomed agent of the expedition's financial backers. Not scary at all but does have its moments.";

It's very simple those who entered the tomb will be visited by Prem their destruction drawing nigh..each individual are seen in Haiti's crystal ball Hasmid prays to his cat idol speaking the words from the shroud  the victims are targeted and executed.I think this mummy film like CURSE OF THE MUMMY TOMB and The MUMMY preceding it stays in formula..basically those who invade a tomb must answer for it. Hasmid is the true villain for the mummy Prem can only harm when ordered from the shroud..and the mummy's reign of terror can only be silenced when the shroud is taken from the one using it as a weapon. The sets and props..the sepulcher of the Pharoah and the different artifacts foundaren't convincing but the superb casting helps keep it afloat. Morell a very good but underappreciated actor who worked in other Hammer filmsPlague of the ZombiesHound of the Baskervilles doesn't have a lot of screen time which was a shame. Phillips has the role of unkind selfish businessman who orders others around wishes to hog the spotlight a proved coward when facing possible danger willing to leave even the most loyal behind to save his own skin..a really loathsome swine the fat cat who gets rich off of the hardworking efforts of others. Michael Ripper has yet another substantial Hammer role when working under the direction of John Gilling..such as THE REPTILE and PLAGUE OF THE ZOMBIESas the longsuffering bullied and improperly mistreated..and ultimately tragicpress secretary for Preston Longbarrow whose undying loyalty to his employer leads to a horrifying fate. Buck's Paul who loathesdisapproves of his father's behavior is the hero who along with Kimberly's Claire must find a way to stop the killing as their colleagues die around them with the police unable to stop the madness. Delgado is appropriately malicious as Hasmid reveling in his duty to persecute those who robbed his ancestor's tomb with Lacey colorful as the demented witch with the crystal ball..her wicked eyes and grin are quite memorable. Nongory but startlingly violent attacks by the powerful mummy on victims includes a skullcrushing acid bath..with a subsequent fire set to the body head slammed into a wall and a body..wrapped in a curtaintossed through a window bashing the street below. Great special effects sequence at the end showing the deterioration of the crumbling mummy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Returning from an expedition the crew members who brought a royal mummy back to town find themselves being stalked and killed by the revived mummy and try to stop its deadly rampage.This one actually turned out to be quite decent overall as there's a lot to like here but does have some big flaws here. One of the biggest pluses to this is the rather enjoyable action scenes that have a lot of rather kinetic enjoyable fun to them whether it's the opening assault taking place in historical Egypt or the exploration of the tomb as both of these manages to feature some enjoyable and surprising aspect to not only keep them moving along but also feature some suspenseful moments to match the spectacle. Other action scenes especially the resurrection flashback which utilizes the great eyemoving trick before getting out of the coffin while the unaware victim keeps reading off the scroll until the fateful attack the first attack in the gypsy's' lair as it appears behind the beaded door and especially the second attack in the photography studio where the reflection in the solution lead to a wild brawl that gets quite fun throughout the rather brief time but ends on a blast with the flaming acid signaling a rather impressive scene. As well the finale here works incredibly well by featuring the appeasement attempt before it resurrects and begins brawling and chasing them around the exhibit before finally having the fun of getting the mummy turned to stone so there's plenty of exciting action placed there to get this one on a highnote. Still there's a few things that hold this one back most notably the subplot about the doctor being placed in an asylum which has little if anything to do with the film itself and isn't really given any sort of justification why. It plays it off as if that was how the end result for him all along was going to play out yet then has him break out anyway which causes a series of logic problems with incarcerating him in the first place. Likewise it's all part of the problem with this one as it really holds off the mummy getting involved until really late into this one by being resurrected pretty late and note really getting a lot to do with this scenes of the crew waiting around for it to come to life. That it has to go back to resting instead of going out as a hunter for the fulltime does make this tend to feel a bit repetitive having to go into the resurrection each time out but overall isn't all that bad.Today's RatingPG Violence.".
