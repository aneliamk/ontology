The boat explodes and the group tries to swim to the distant coast. Soon they see a cargo ship anchored in the sea and they ask for help. But Sara Ivn and Edgar witness two crewmen stabbing a black man and throwing his body overboard. However they decide to climb the pilot ladder and hide in the ship expecting to reach a port. When Thais is bitten by a rat Sara and Victor seek medicine to disinfect her hand but one crewman sees him. Victor decides to turn himself in to protect the other stowaways. His scheme does not work as planned and the trip has a tragic end.Cmara Oscura is a movie with a lame and stupid story. The plot is inconsistent and imbecile from the beginning without any character development. Who is Victor and why did he bring his sixmonth pregnant wife with him to the open sea in a small boat piloted by a teenager? Why Victor had to point the flare to a dead man? The group witnesses a murder and prefers to go on board as stowaways without water or supply instead of asking for help. When a rat bites if he is infected with leptospirosis or rabies the victim will not be healed or disinfected with firstaid. How stupid is Victor carrying a walkietalkie with him? Sara using her flash to blind the snake is hilarious. Victor is hidden and goes by himself to meet the crew to protect his wife when he is left on the open deck Thais leaves the hideout to release him in a non sense situation. Victor is invited to have dinner and surrounded by the captain that has an amicable behavior with him and his crew and the guy decides to offend them for free in an absurd situation. What is the captain's motivation? Is he with his men or with the Stowaways? I could list another dozen plot holes but I believe this is enough to illustrate how bad this movie is. My vote is three.Title Brazil Pnico a Bordo Panic on Board".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this with my family on German television and it did for us what we expected it to do. A bit of thrill and suspense interesting atmosphere and the urge to watch it until the end because you want to know who makes it out of the mess.If you expect an original cleverly constructed plot absence of clich and blood and gore this might be the wrong film for you.The plot is clearly constructed at times to create the situations the filmmakers were aiming for. Clichs are waiting around pretty much every corner of that creepy ship. And the violence is almost never shown directly a benefit for someone like me who is not into that kind of thing. The main element of horror is the ship and the inhumanity.Another letdown are the underdeveloped characters. If you follow the Spanish movie scene a bit you will recognise some of the actors and know that they are in fact quite excellent. Especially the wonderful Llus Homar the captain 'La Mala educacin' and charismatic youngster Andrs Gertrdix Edgar 'The Orphanage' are severely underemployed by the scrip and direction. Just rare intimate moments like Edgar's tearful look of sadness at his friend Ivn who is about to face up the ship's crew which probably means certain death as shown earlier in the movie give you a hint at how interesting the exploit of emotions and relationships between the characters could have been.Which leads to another letdown which would be the unconvincing 'relationship' the filmmakers want to force Ivn and Sara into. Yesyes we know the heroine and the soon to become hero need to end up with each other but do we really want them to? No. Because there is zero chemistry between the actors. You don't even know why on earth these two should fall for each other. The only convincing connection of friendship and love is between the young couple Victor and Thais and between Ivn and Edgar. In fact we all ended up rooting for Ivn to end up with his friend Edgar instead of with Sara. A theory that is not even that absurd given the level of homoerotic vibes between the two characters something for the ladies who are into that kind of undertones. If you think of the conversation going on right before Edgar's declaration of love you might wonder as well if the writers were cackling to themselves in a corner about that little twist.Additionally there are logical flaws like the walkietalkie suddenly being on receptionmode but I have to correct one of my fellow writers who said the movie was suddenly switching from night to midday. It begins on midday and ends in the morning of the following day. There is clearly some dawnearly morning light situation towards the end before the sun comes out.And I liked that the movie does not follow the rules of who should die first and how likable or dislikable the villains victims or survivors should be. Nor do I mind the characters changing their attitude without the usual Hollywood movie intheface explanation and monologue. That is how humans are. They are irrational and don't necessarily announce to the world when they experience a change of mind just to let the movie audience know. So in a way the characters are acting more natural and human than those in your usual teeny horror flick that leaves no room for surprises where you always know what kind of character you are dealing with.Overall an average thriller with a good atmosphere which makes you mourn for all it could have been because it gives you glimpses of all its wasted potential.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was lucky enough to catch this film at its premiere midnight showing in Sitges Spain.

The film opens with a great visual image of a woman in distress and while the story involving how she got into that situation doesn't quite live up to the initial shock there are enough twists and turns to keep up interest. I thought the acting was fairly good across the board especially with the crew of the ship. The directing could have handled a little help but shaky camera setups are hip and I'll leave that alone. Basically it boils down to I liked it I recommend it.".

The movie's set in Vermont but the script contains references to rednecks...c'mon how seriously can you take that? Lighten up everyone. This isn't a Steven Seagal movie!Here's an example. A character has been savagely kicked and beaten and was nearly killed. He's being nursed back to health by an attractive woman. One thing leads to another and suddenly she's on top of him kissing his chest. I...I can't he says. Why she asks. And he goes off on some long tale about his tragic past. A more clever screenplay would have had him reply Because I have a few miles of bandages around my broken ribs and you're sitting on my chest that's why!But the movie's worth a rental I think as long as you're in the right mood.

Too bad it doesn't work any better than you think it would.They throw a few gallons of flaming gasoline around toss a car off a cliff give a standard gun fight and have some of the most horribly choreographed fight scenes ever put to film but that about wraps it up for the action. There is a point where a guy takes a swing at Billy in a bar and the punch is so far off target that it looks like the guy aimed it at the next county but Billy goes flying anyway. They didn't cut the scene and shoot it again. They just left it in the movie. Too funny.The rest is all a clichfest right down to the corrupt sheriff and fired bullets throwing sparks when they hit anything besides flesh. When will movie makers figure out that lead and copper are soft metals and don't ever throw sparks when they hit something? This little movie lie always pisses me off. Other than that it's just Billy Ray Goodguy vs Bobby Jo Badguy who proves how bad he is by hitting women and driving a black Hummer. And we know Billy is a good guy because he has a dream catcher hanging from his rear view mirror.Add some grade Z actors working for free and worth every penny and there you have it a straight to video movie made for those gals that think Billy Ray and his mullet are two of the cutest things ever.".

	schema:reviewBody "No One Can Hold Him Back! What? Billy Ray Cyrus in an Rrated directtovideo action movie named RADICAL JACK? What was Dwight Yoakam Randy Travis or Brooks andor Dunn not available? But more importantly...where do I sign up? Jack Joseph Reynolds Cyrus is an MIA CIA exDesert Storm Navy SEAL who just wants to sit in the local bar and say nope over and over again after a terrorist named Riotti killed his wife during a botched mission. He is persuaded however to go undercover as a drifter in the small town of Hope Vermont. Obviously this place is a hotbed of gunrunning. The axis of evil in the Vermont burg is a father and son team of Lloyd and Rolland Buckworth Flower and Keanu Reeves lookalike Blake respectively and a bunch of redneck good ol' boys who do their bidding. Due to the radicalness of his mission his code name is Radical Jack and he calls in to his superiors with the code name Radical 177.Reynolds gets a job at the local watering hole called the Red Moon Saloon apparently a real place. There he meets Kate Pfeiffer one of the many women in Hope who think he is the hottest hunk in town. They develop a relationship but there's a problem. She just broke up with Rolland because of his abusive ways. He's not happy. Because Radical Jack is infringing upon his gun and missile dealings AND his woman Rolland declares allout war on Jack. The results are less than radical.There is an attempt at seriousness here to the film's detriment. Sadly it has an amateurish rockbottom DTV look to it both in the technical aspects and the acting. To be fair everyone seemed to be trying hard though. The film is some kind of knock off of Road House 1989 and Beyond the Law 1992.Flower as Lloyd is the leastmenacing villain ever. When he says I want the missiles he's about as intimidating as a WalMart greeter.And what would the PAX network think of Cyrus' very unDoclike performance here? His mullet is mighty and it even has powers. Whenever he has a flashback he touches his mullet which is connected to the remembrance parts of his brain. I think I saw the title mullet wrangler in the end credits. Even when he wears his recon hat  a special hat he uses when he spies on people using 90's kids toy SpyTech  his mullet does all the acting.In one of the prerequisite barfights we even get to see some of his patented CyrusFu as takes down Rolland. There is also the standard abandoned warehouse scene silly twists in the plot that make no sense and a curious lack of action. There is even a counter that appears on screen from time to time reminding you in army time how much time has passed on his mission. The viewer despairs at how little time has actually passed. Why would the filmmakers rub that in? When you are watching Radical Jack at times it dawns on you that I am WATCHING RADICAL JACK. It really makes you reassess your life and your priorities.Surely a punishment for Miley would be to be subjected to this slop of a slog of a film. Not that that is a surprise in any way.Have an achybreaky good time watching this Radical crud.".

In the process he hopes to find the man responsible for killing his wife and child.Radical Jack may have been released in 2000 but it feels like an 80s action movie. All the standard 80s clichs are there. I could just imagine someone like Van Damme or Stallone playing the lead. Instead we have Billy Ray Cyrus. And to my utter amazement Cyrus is not the biggest weakness in the movie. In fact I'd say he's one of the few bright spots. As I've already alluded to the biggest problem comes from a tired clich filled plot that brings absolutely nothing new to the action genre. A loner on a motorcycle arrives in a new town and takes a job tending bar. He immediately runs into trouble with the local gun runner's son when the son's girl takes an interest in the new guy. He's an exNavy Seal at least I think he is who manages to fight off a halfdozen thugs. He's eventually beatdown and goes into hiding. The girl nurses him back to health and the pair fall in love. Together they bring down the baddies. Sound familiar?Other low points include poor fight choreography a remixed Achy Breaky Heart and mostly bad acting. Other highlights include Dedee Pfieiffer and . . . well that's about it. A 310 seems about right.".

It was like they wanted to make sure the star looked good by picking worseacting bad guys and a completely unimaginative film location.

	schema:reviewBody "When Billy Ray Cyrus burst on the Country Music scene in 1992 with Achy Breaky Heart he immediately became a hot property. With smoldering good looks and an imposing physique he had real star quality. Cyrus had been a champion athlete in school and his 6' frame still sculpted with muscle and some badass ink made him a natural for action movies like Radical Jack. The plot was pretty simple  Jack an exNavy SEAL goes undercover in a hick town to bust an arms seller falls in love with the innocent girlfriend of the head bad guy and leaves a trail of bodies at the end. Wisely they used this thin storyline to showcase Cyrus both as a fighter and a lover. With his trademark mullet morphed into movie star locks and his sleeves rolled up to display his big tattooed arms Billy Ray's transformation into a redneck sex symbol is quickly established.Billy Ray hits town and immediately crosses swords with Rolland played by Noah Blake. The smooth Blake is a good foil for Cyrus he's leaner more polished but his muscular body and martial arts skills are clearly deadly. He has a posse of goons chief among them the familiar Rusty De Wees who has made a career out of playing backwoods enforcers. Add to the mix a couple of crooked cops and you can see early on that Billy Ray will have his work cut out for him.Along with punch ups and beat downs there's a budding romance between Cyrus and Kate DeDee Pfeiffer. We first see Kate in a sex scene with Rolland she's topless he's in boxers and socks but it's only a prelude to her breakup with him. When Jack shows up Kate falls hard and we get to see her seducing him in a steamy bed scene where both bodies are on display. Sex actually plays a big role in this movie. When a crooked cop's wife threatens the arms deal another officer is sent to silence her but he takes time to bed her first before pulling the trigger. Inevitably we also get a scene where Rolland's lovemaking gets heavy handed and Kate's black eye and swollen lip lead to Jack vowing to kill Rolland.Along with the sex there's plenty of fighting. Cyrus has ample opportunity to show off with martial arts moves and two fisted punching. Rolland never runs out of goons for him to put away  some of them permanently. Cyrus finally gets a beatdown of his own from De Wees and a dozen hillbilly musclemen but that just gives Kate an excuse to nurse him back to health in her bedroom where Billy Ray  naked except for a pair of flimsy drawstring pants  gets treated to some tender loving care. In the end Jack makes sure all the bad guys meet an appropriate end. In an orgy of gun violence Jack slays every thug in sight. De Wees's muscles don't do him any good against the exSEAL and though Jack promised Kate he would off Rolland for manhandling her she does the honors herself by putting a bullet in his head.As an action movie Radical Jack didn't break any new ground but as a vehicle to showcase big bad Billy Ray Cyrus it did a great job. Cyrus went on to star in a number of TV shows but never made another shoot 'em up action movie  too bad.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not sure whose bright idea it was to make this film but it is a bad one. Wait I do know whose idea this was! It was made by the same studio that brought us Time Chasers Arachnia and various other films set in Rutledge Vermont! So getting Billy Ray Cyrus and Michelle Pfeiffer's sister was like getting Alist star for them. Okay Blist star as they once got Bruce Campbell and Sean Astin for a movie that was like Die Hard at a ski resort so that tandem definitely upstages a country music star and a famous actress' sister.The story well a dude with a past gets sent in to stop some small arms weapons dealers or something. His code name Radical Jack! So you know that he is going to be a total badass that takes no prisoners! Well he does okay against two guys more than that and he is trounced however he makes up for it by barely being able to walk one day and able to pull off the final climatic battle the next. He also gets a job at a bar where he tries to do his best Patrick Swayze from Roadhouse but with very poor fighting skills. His best move is throwing people on cars...Billy Ray is not a good actor that being said the rest of the cast is so awful he acts circles around them. Dee Dee is attractive but not in her sister's leagues as far as looks or acting ability and the main bad guy is over the top. George 'Buck' Flower is also in this best known for bit roles in John Carpenter films like The Fog and They Live.The film is just not good and the fight scenes are a joke. I never get the sense that Radical Jack is all that tough or someone that can take down arms dealers and the whole using a table saw and having flashback scenes was eye rolling. The last part of the film kept featuring betrayals to the point I was waiting for someone else to enter the warehouse and tell them how they were responsible. Just laughably bad and the type of film only a woman who wears a mullet could love as that type of woman is the one who would dance to Achy Breaky Heart back in the day and fantasize about Billy Ray.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was praised to be hilarious and a parody of all of these Vietnam war movies so i got a grip on the original DVD and watched it. The hopes were pushed really high by the texts in the advertisements but as i am familiar with amateurmovie productions i did not take these lines that serious because most of them are only added to push the marketing. As this is a complete amateur production i even won't say its a bmovie. Simply because it does not reach that level.The first thing i noticed was that there were scenes taken from other movies and put into this one the helicopter ones which you can easily notice on the massive picture quality difference. Second thing i noticed was that the audio and video were about .2 to .3 seconds asynchronous which i count as a major minus. The rifle shots and explosions are all digitally put in after wards but they look nice for an amateur movie. I think they did that because you can't simply detonate explosives in a German forest without permission. The forest looked pretty good and also the soldiers equipment was well done so thats a plus.The characters in the movie are shallow and fit the usual stereotypes not even mentioning the acting which was in my opinion... brutal to look at. Don't expect anything from that part. Sometimes its embarrassing how desperately they try to fulfill that stereotypes.Together with the fact that i did not have to laugh for a single time during the whole movie there was not even a grin on my face because it is simply not funny at all made me think how to get back the hour i wasted with this movie.So i recommend it only for hardcore trash fans. Everyone else stay away.".

There are no speaking actors yet the hearing viewer isn't lost because there are voice overs. I was shocked at the attention to detail. There are great camera angles a good plot interesting characters and just a lot of plain old good times! This is a twist on the classic Dracula films that works so well. It has all the shock value and drama needed to make it the classic B as well as the cheese factor that makes you fall in love with it. I adore this movie and am so grateful to a friend for giving it me. I've never seen anything like it and apparently never will again being as it currently is the first and only deaf based movie. The whole movie is an experience that defies description it's a must see on anyone B movie lovers list!".

The good news is that it's totally strange and exactly what I hoped that it would be. In truth it's also the first ASL film ever made.It was written and directed by  and stars  Peter Wechsberg using the stage name Peter Wolf. As a student at the deaffriendly Gallaudet University he went on to be in the National Theater of the Deaf.

After seeing the Danish Nicolas Winding Refn's hardcore Pushertrilogy this German effort seems almost like an ambitious schoolproject that just lacked the budget andor passion to make it better. It's a shame because it seems like the makers really had an important message they wanted to convey but in the end it didn't really come through as strong as they probably would have wanted.Overall a decent story for a short feature but stretched into full featurefilm length it just seems prolonged and gets a bit boring after a while.

	schema:reviewBody "Dealer is a German film from 1999 so it will soon have its 20th anniversary. The writer and director is Thomas Arslan who recently made some waves with his 2013 film Gold with Nina Hoss. But this one we have here is among his early career efforts. You can see the talent here and there but as a whole he was still far from his best. Just like some other works from Arslan's early years this one here was fairly short namely not even 75 minutes and this already includes credits. Lead actor is Tamer Yigit and he is certainly less known today as some of his coactors. Birol nel who plays a cop and Idil ner who plays the main characters girlfriend have made it big afterward mostly thanks to Faith Akin but also to their talent of course. The rest of the cast here I am not familiar with at all. It is a mix of German and Turkish actors.This is the story of a young man who gets deeper and deeper into the world of crime drug dealing etc. and cannot seem to stay away from it despite trying on some occasions. Not even the efforts to help him by a police officer and his girlfriend contribute anything positive to the protagonist's mindset almost the opposite. I think the best thing here is that the film feels very realistic from start to finish and does not include any forced happy moments or even a forced happy ending. But all in all the bad is just more significant. I never felt that Arslan made the most of the story and its potential. Another problem is that the line delivery felt extremely wooden at times and while the actors did a good job on many occasions too these weak moments from the cast hurt the movie a lot as it took all the flow out of the story. Eventually I must say I am glad this one was so short. But I am also disappointed because it's obvious that there is some decent potential here in everybody and this potential was not even close in being fulfilled referring to the script and cast. Thumbs down from me. Not recommended.".

	schema:headline " Drug Bustin' With Testi  Hemmings  Entertaining Poliziottesco";
	schema:reviewBody "Drug trafficking is not my favorite theme in Italian Crime flicks I personally prefer Unorthodox Cops vs. Sadistic killers such as in Lenzi's Almost Human or hardboiled Mafia stories such as in Fernando Di Leo's Milieu trilogy. Yet I must say that La Via Della Droga aka. The Heroin Busters of 1977 is a more than worthwhile Poliziottesco that no genrelover should consider missing. The multitalented Exploitation mastermind Enzo G. Castellari in the director's chair a cast including Fabio Testi and David Hemmings loads of violent shootouts and a score by Goblin  what else could a fan of Italian genre cinema ask for? Fabio Testi plays drug smuggler Fabio who is arrested when trying to get a considerable amount of heroin into Rome. After escaping from jail and obtaining the trust of a local druglord Joshua Sinclair Fabio turns out to be in fact an undercover cop who works together with international drug squad officer Mike Hamilton David Hemmings. Determined to rid Rome of Heroin Fabio and Mike are also willing to use unorthodox methods... While La Via Della Droga is certainly no Poliziotteschi highlight en par with Almost Human or Rome Armed To The Teeth this is a film that should not be missed by a genre fan. Whereas the storyline is not the best ever the film is full of violent shootouts carchases occasional sleaze and stylish brutality. I've personally been a great fan of Enzo G. Castellari for years sadly enough I still haven't seen his supposedly best Poliziotteschi La Polizia Incrimina La Legge Assolve aka. High Crime 1973 and Il Cittadino Si Ribella Street LawThe Citizen Rebels 1974. La Via Della Droga however is more than a bit entertaining and if the two aforementioned films are even better I can't wait to see them. I am also a great fan of both leading men both of whom have starred in personal Giallofavorites of mine David Hemmings in Dario Argento's Profondo Rosso Fabio Testi in Massimo Dallamano's What Have You Done To Solange and both are once again excellent in their roles. Especially Testi does a great job as the hero here while Hemmings' role could have been bigger. Joshua Sinclair Keoma also makes a good villain. My only real complaint is that I would have wished for David Hemmings to have more screen time. The score by Progressive Rock band Goblin is great as always even though it comes nowhere near the brilliance of the scores they did for Dario Argento's masterpieces. All in all La Via Della Droga is a more than recommendable Poliziottesco that my fellow fans of Italian Crime cinema should enjoy.".

	onyx:emotionText "Drug trafficking is not my favorite theme in Italian Crime flicks I personally prefer Unorthodox Cops vs. Sadistic killers such as in Lenzi's Almost Human or hardboiled Mafia stories such as in Fernando Di Leo's Milieu trilogy. Yet I must say that La Via Della Droga aka. The Heroin Busters of 1977 is a more than worthwhile Poliziottesco that no genrelover should consider missing. The multitalented Exploitation mastermind Enzo G. Castellari in the director's chair a cast including Fabio Testi and David Hemmings loads of violent shootouts and a score by Goblin  what else could a fan of Italian genre cinema ask for? Fabio Testi plays drug smuggler Fabio who is arrested when trying to get a considerable amount of heroin into Rome. After escaping from jail and obtaining the trust of a local druglord Joshua Sinclair Fabio turns out to be in fact an undercover cop who works together with international drug squad officer Mike Hamilton David Hemmings. Determined to rid Rome of Heroin Fabio and Mike are also willing to use unorthodox methods... While La Via Della Droga is certainly no Poliziotteschi highlight en par with Almost Human or Rome Armed To The Teeth this is a film that should not be missed by a genre fan. Whereas the storyline is not the best ever the film is full of violent shootouts carchases occasional sleaze and stylish brutality. I've personally been a great fan of Enzo G. Castellari for years sadly enough I still haven't seen his supposedly best Poliziotteschi La Polizia Incrimina La Legge Assolve aka. High Crime 1973 and Il Cittadino Si Ribella Street LawThe Citizen Rebels 1974. La Via Della Droga however is more than a bit entertaining and if the two aforementioned films are even better I can't wait to see them. I am also a great fan of both leading men both of whom have starred in personal Giallofavorites of mine David Hemmings in Dario Argento's Profondo Rosso Fabio Testi in Massimo Dallamano's What Have You Done To Solange and both are once again excellent in their roles. Especially Testi does a great job as the hero here while Hemmings' role could have been bigger. Joshua Sinclair Keoma also makes a good villain. My only real complaint is that I would have wished for David Hemmings to have more screen time. The score by Progressive Rock band Goblin is great as always even though it comes nowhere near the brilliance of the scores they did for Dario Argento's masterpieces. All in all La Via Della Droga is a more than recommendable Poliziottesco that my fellow fans of Italian Crime cinema should enjoy.";

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw this film many years ago I was put off by its slow and fragmented first ten minutes featuring scenes of gratuitous! drug use in various parts of the world. Also I had just seen David Hemmings' other Italian crime film from this year SWINDLE with Tomas Milian directed by Bruno Corbucci which was INCREDIBLE and this did not seem as good. However once the film kicks into gear after fifteen minutes or so it is quite good and features some incredible stunt work imaginative action sequences exciting guitardriven music from Goblin not as repetitive as some of their work a wonderful overthetop performance by David Hemmings as an interpol narcotics investigator and a cool smoldering performance by Fabio Testi as an undercover cop out to bust the international drug trade. As a later 70s product this film features unnecessary closeup shots of drug use and some gratuitous nudity a lesbian scene presented as a FANTASY of a minor character! but there's not enough of either to derail what becomes a nailbiting action film. The final fifteen to twenty minutes of HEROIN BUSTERS are incrediblethe motorcycle chase in the subway which leads into an outrageous airplane chasesome of the most interesting and daredevil actionfilm stuntwork I've seen in a while. The film also has nice bursts of humor here and there such as when Hemmings chasing a crook gets a ride from a young lady on a motorcycle and has to grab on to her breast to hold on! and was quite satisfying on all levels. It does start slow however so don't give up on it or fast forward through some of the initial scenes. What a golden age of Italian crime films the 1970's waseven a standard genre entry turns out to be a gem the likes of which would NEVER be made today.".

	schema:reviewBody "You can always rely on Enzo Castellari to knock things up a notch and even though he had me worried and a little confused at the pacing of this one it all leads up to major kick ass ending. After the film seemingly randomly shifts between Hong Kong Amsterdam Colombia and New York the film finally settles in Rome as we see Fabio Testi getting busted for carrying drugs into the country. At the same time and in the same place another guy who's just arrived from Amsterdam is tailed by cop David Hemmings who gets duped by the dealers as big old Romano Puppo gets away with the goods. Yep Hemmings is hot headed pottymouthed cop out to take down a huge drug cartel and he's the only guy who knows that Fabio Testi is an undercover cop. Things get pretty difficult for Testi as he works his way into the dealer's trust via a junky guy with his own sub plot and nothing ends up going to plan as everything results in a huge chase at the end that uses feet motorbikes and finally planes. I think there's a deep meaning to all this and that is If you deal drugs Fabio Testi will shoot you.You've got the usual Enzo back up crew here Massimo Vanni who does his 'riding a bike downstairs' bit Joshua Sinclair as a suave dealer Romano Puppo as another dealer and even Enzo himself turns up to mug for the camera. Sherry Buchanan turns up as the junky guy's girlfriend but she really just turns up to be naked for a minute or two.I found it strange that there's an obvious stunt double doing even the most routine of stunts for Fabio but then it's Fabio himself doing all that crazy crap with the planes later. I did burst out laughing when a guy pulled a particularly strange face when getting shot in slow motion. It does seem however that Enzo is kind of making some sort of comment about the hippy life being dead and leading to horrible addiction because the drug taking here is shown in all its glory and when you see a guy licking spilled heroin from a toilet seat it doesn't exactly entice you to go take the stuff. Well done Enzo!".

As it is the problem with many genre films of its decade the depiction of the drug dealers their environments and the investigating methods of the undercover cop looks clichd and hilariously out of date. Except for that this is a highly entertaining action packed film.Fabio Testi never looks like a real drug dealer but who cares his acting is solid as ever. David Hemmings as the police inspector who knows about Testi's true identity brings English flair to the role with his sometimes almost exaggerated British accent. The supporting cast consists of many faces familiar from other Italian genre outings e.g. the ruthless syndicate killer in Lucio Fulci's Luca il Contrabbandiere from 1981 also starring Testi in the lead role and the score by the at that time Argento regulars Goblin just rocks. There are some quite original action sequences especially the climax in which director Enzo Girolami delivers a plane chase for once instead of a car chase and this plane chase looks daring sometimes. Because the simple plot always pushes the action forward the movie never becomes boring and delivers.Certainly not Enzo Girolami's best film his La Polizia Incrimina la Legge Assolve is probably the best Italian crime film ever made mainly because the story is never really convincing but it's fast paced and will please every fan of Italian crime thrillers.".

	schema:reviewBody "International heroin smugglers are traveling between Colombia Hong Kong Amsterdam New York and Rome plying their sinister trade. Mike Hamilton Hemmings is an Interpol agent obsessed with stemming the tide of drugs from these professional narcoticssmuggling gangs. But he's in his office. On the actual streets is Fabio Testi an undercover cop who makes plenty of enemies in the underworld. It all comes to a head when said baddies all come after Fabio and he has to use all his wits to get away with his life. Can he do it? There seems to be no end to the amazing contributions of Enzo G. Castellari to the world of filmed entertainment. From Light Blast 1985 to his postapocalyptic Video Store Classics 1990 The Bronx Warriors 1982 and The New Barbarians 1983 to his Westerns like Any Gun Can Play 1967 to his trilogy of topnotch Poliziotteschi Street Law 1974 The Big Racket 1976 and this The Heroin Busters the list goes on and on. Is there anything he can't do? When you're adept at so many genres that level of talent opens you up to new audiences and many different types of film fans have a special place in their hearts for Enzo. We certainly do.Everything is topnotch here from the way it's shot and edited to the acting clothing set design etc. it's firing on all cylinders. Enzo seemed to really want to show the grossness and evil of drugs showing the subculture not as glamorous and exciting but as disgusting and dingy. David Hemmings puts in an energetic performance and the icing on the cake is the typicallystellar Goblin soundtrack.But truly the man of the hour is Fabio Testi. He seems so effortlessly cool in everything he does and pretty much the last halfhour of this movie is him doing a lot of superawesome things. Enzo just stacks ingenious on top of ingenious until the audience is overwhelmed. If you've seen it  you know what we mean and if you haven't the excellent Blue Underground DVD is available now at an allnew low price. You can't afford to NOT see it.The Heroin Busters is yet another jewel in the crown of Enzo as well as everyone else involved with this fine production.".

	onyx:emotionText "International heroin smugglers are traveling between Colombia Hong Kong Amsterdam New York and Rome plying their sinister trade. Mike Hamilton Hemmings is an Interpol agent obsessed with stemming the tide of drugs from these professional narcoticssmuggling gangs. But he's in his office. On the actual streets is Fabio Testi an undercover cop who makes plenty of enemies in the underworld. It all comes to a head when said baddies all come after Fabio and he has to use all his wits to get away with his life. Can he do it? There seems to be no end to the amazing contributions of Enzo G. Castellari to the world of filmed entertainment. From Light Blast 1985 to his postapocalyptic Video Store Classics 1990 The Bronx Warriors 1982 and The New Barbarians 1983 to his Westerns like Any Gun Can Play 1967 to his trilogy of topnotch Poliziotteschi Street Law 1974 The Big Racket 1976 and this The Heroin Busters the list goes on and on. Is there anything he can't do? When you're adept at so many genres that level of talent opens you up to new audiences and many different types of film fans have a special place in their hearts for Enzo. We certainly do.Everything is topnotch here from the way it's shot and edited to the acting clothing set design etc. it's firing on all cylinders. Enzo seemed to really want to show the grossness and evil of drugs showing the subculture not as glamorous and exciting but as disgusting and dingy. David Hemmings puts in an energetic performance and the icing on the cake is the typicallystellar Goblin soundtrack.But truly the man of the hour is Fabio Testi. He seems so effortlessly cool in everything he does and pretty much the last halfhour of this movie is him doing a lot of superawesome things. Enzo just stacks ingenious on top of ingenious until the audience is overwhelmed. If you've seen it  you know what we mean and if you haven't the excellent Blue Underground DVD is available now at an allnew low price. You can't afford to NOT see it.The Heroin Busters is yet another jewel in the crown of Enzo as well as everyone else involved with this fine production.";

This particular Poliziotteschi or Euro crime is yet another brilliant work of Enzo Castellari's one of the key players in this genre. This movie is a classic very entertaining packed with action a strong plot and Fabio Testi to top it all off! Ignore any mediocre reviews this movie is phenomenal. A must see especially for fans of euro crime. In this movie Fabio Testi plays an officer who goes deep cover in the heroin game to try and take out the big boys of the operation. Only one cop is aware of the undercover op so this movie is basically Testi vs. the world with one cop on his side. The action in this movie continues from beginning to end and the question is continually asked who is more of a threat to Fabio the heroin dealers he is trying to bust or his fellow police officers who believe him to be another drug dealing son of a bitch?!".

	schema:reviewBody "There were a lot of good Dirty Harry inspired cop films made in Italy during the seventies and while The Heroin Busters isn't one of the best of them  it's still a damn fine example of this sort of film. By far the best thing about Italian Dirty Harry ripoffs is the entertainment value and The Heroin Busters delivers that in spades! Granted it's a bit slow to start though never boring but once the film kicks into action properly it comes thick and fast and the film includes one of the best action sequences I've seen in a film like this  that being the one that sees Fabio Testi being chased through a construction site. As the title suggests this is a film that bases its plot around drugs. Apparently drugs are being trafficked around the world from Rome and police chief Mike Hamilton decides to do something about it by having Fabio go undercover as a drug dealer. This requires him to immerse himself in the criminal underworld with the intention being to get close to the lower level criminals so that he can eventually catch the big guns at the top.The film features a great pair of central performances from David Hemmings and Fabio Testi. This is undoubtedly one of the best things about the film as both of their performances are excellent and they offset each other brilliantly. Testi is great in the 'action hero' role as he fits the bill perfectly and does a great job with the action scenes also. Hemmings is at the other end of the spectrum with his role as the police chief but he does just great also and it's great seeing these two together. The music comes courtesy of Dario Argento's house band Goblin and while their work on this film doesn't rival the stuff they did for Argento The Heroin Busters certainly isn't lacking in the music department. The film is directed by Enzo G. Castellari who directed a couple of well revered crime flicks before this one including the excellent 'The Big Racket'. The film features a few big set pieces and the climax which takes the form of a plane chase is a more than fitting finale to an audacious crime extravaganza. This isn't as good as Italian crime flicks get  but it's not bad at all and comes highly recommended!".

The Heroin Busters gets off to a good start with a opening credit sequence featuring a montage of scenes highlighting drug trafficking in Hong Kong Columbia and Rome set to some nice 80s actionstyle music. The action sequences in The Heroin Busters are good but the promised motorcycle and airplane chase big finale wasn't all that I had been led to believe it would be. It's good but it ran a little too long for me. The action sequence immediately preceding the supposed big finish where Fabio Testi is being chased through the construction site is easily one of my favorite moments in the film. On the acting side both Testi and David Hemmings are fine in their roles and I especially enjoyed the few scenes they had together. Few being the key word as I would have liked more shared screen time between the two. Finally I never really bought the notion of Testi as a drug dealer. I knew something was up as soon as he came on screen.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure what I can add that hasn't already been said in some of these other fine and quite hilarious comments but Ill try.So you know the plot there is a bed possessed by a demon that absorbs and selectively disintegrates the bodies of whoever or whatever lays on it with its orange sodafilled body. We have the man in some scenes looking uncannily like Robert Smith of The Cure hanging out inside the wall commenting on the goingson and we have our various victims that just cant resist the comfort of this mystical bed.This is no ordinary bed. No sirree Bob! Not only does it eat people but it cleans up after itself draws the covers back and it even makes itself. Who wouldn't want a bed like that? It can even use its sheets as a rudimentary lasso to wrangle escaped victims back in especially if they're taking up half the length of the film to try and escape.Our main story if you can call it that is about these three girls who go out to this remote area to housesit??. I don't recall exactly but it doesn't really matter though as there are plenty of things that defy convention that you just have to give in and accept. The dialogue in the film is like no other the characters talk to each other seemingly by telepathy as their mouths never seem to move and there is a constant echo. One of our girls believes she isn't liked by the rest of the gang and makes sure to tell us all her feelings on this matter through an echoey voiceover but we don't care character development was thrown out the window a LONG time before in this film so why start now? There are scenes when the bed laughs snores crunches and makes various other noises that we assume judging by our cast's nonreaction to said noises cant be heard. This and the telepathy makes the issue of diegesis very difficult to ascertain...but thats OK....this is Death Bed The Bed That Eats and it defies all logic so its OK. It makes for a lush dreamy quality to this most bizarre film If you buy hehe buy...did I say buy? this DVD make sure to check out the introduction by the director. He explains that the filming of this flick started in 1972 didn't wrap up until 1977 he shopped it for a few years with no luck and then fast forward 26 years to 2003 it gets released on DVD. Supposedly someone somewhere had a print of this in some other country and made bootleg after bootleg of it and it was quite by chance on a message board no less that our director found evidence that people knew and gasp! cared about his littleknown film. Its from there that he decided to give it a shot and release it. I'm glad he did. Once you've even so much as heard the title to this film you MUST see it. I for one am going to buy this and I'm going to preach its gospel around the world...starting with this comment".

Perhaps that's the secret of its charm.Plot? Well sort of. There's this bed that eats people and fried chicken apples flowers suitcases and any other darn thing that gets near it by sucking them inside its digestivefluid filled mattress. Amongst its nearlimitless powers Bed has the ability to keep the spirit of Aubrey Beardsley trapped behind a picture to observe and narrate the events of the film. Various people then wind up at Bed's abandoned mansion Bed's habit of eating anything that moves gave the place an unsavory reputation and lay down to have sex or take a nap or because they don't feel well and get eaten sometimes having trippy dreams first. And in the end we have the explosive final confrontation between Beardsley Bed's mom you had to be there and Bed.Seems rather straightforward when I put it like that doesn't it  well except for the Aubrey Beardsley part. But something feels constantly offkilter and the story seems to glide sleepily from one scene to the next even when indulging in cheap laughs or strange gore effects. Imagine Bunel crossed with Bergman then left to soak in a big vat of Herschell Gordon Lewis. The tone of the story shifts from horror to fairy tale to comedy to existential meditation without breaking stride  an incredible achievement for a nobudget student film shot in the Detroit area.All in all an astounding little film that quite probably no review can ever completely do justice.

	schema:headline " The strangest bedtime story ever told";
	schema:reviewBody "Honestly this is one of the strangest movies I ever saw. It felt like absolutely surreal dreamlike cult film. At the edge of a grand estate near a crumbling old mansion lies a strange stone building with just a single room. In the room there lies a bed. The major imaginative thrive of the movie is that it is narrated by the Victorian artist Aubrey Beardsley who is held captive inside the wall behind one of his paintings next to the bed. Born of demonic power the bed seeks the flesh blood and life essence of unwary travelers. My favorite victim in the film was the gangster who tries to shoot the bed with his gun as if that will help. Well three girls then arrive on vacation searching for a place to spend the night and find themselves sleeping on the bed that eats people. George Barry's uniquely weird journey into horror through a world of carnivorous furnishings was a bit out of this world! Comedian Patton Oswalt once quote that this movie was one of the most awesome movies he ever saw. By watching it I can clearly say he might be putting a bit of a sarcasm tone into that. Still it was pretty entertaining. Who knows a bed can drink Pepto Bismo fried chicken and orange soda?! The bed can also make flowers grow out of a skull lock doors give jewelry to dead people and even masturbates for some odd reason. This movie is a true testament that every horrible idea for an objectbased horror movie has been nearly done. I wasn't scare at all but laughing. The movies take itself so serious but for me it felt like a comedy horror. It could have been better with a better writer. The concept is good. Truly a bed that eats people can be scary in the right hands. A good example of that is 1984's Nightmare on Elm Street with what happens to Johnny Depp's character. In this film the writing is a lengthy monotonous rather incomprehensible story related by the ghost about twothirds of the way through the film about how the bed came to be a bed that eats people. There is another strange series of scenes displaying a woman inside an underground coffin on the estate of the cottage and nearby mansion that I have yet to figure out how it fits into the story. The gore effects in this movie were pretty bad. I like how you can clearly see where the pins connect one fake bone to the other on the clearly fake skeleton hand on the guy after the bed eat him. The sound mix is a bit annoying. The acting is dreadful. The actor who speaks Beardsley's voice is a little bit better than the other cast. His pacing accent and inflections are hypnotic alright. Pay attention if you buy this the dad from Boy meets world is in this as one of the characters brothers. In fact I'm more awestruck by the fact that they started shooting in 1972 and took 5 years to finish this movie. Then nobody would release it for two more decades after its completion. When it finally came out according to the DVD extras Barry seems to have even forgotten he made it. It's one of those movies so bad it's good. So give it a try and sleep on it.".

The demon's eyes freeze two drops of blood fall onto a bed he had specially created for his object of desire. The bed consumes the blood and it's hunger remains..anything that comes in contact with the bed is consumed! This is explained to us by one of the bed's victims a painter whose soul is trapped inside one of his last works the artistic rendering of the his final resting place..he was dying of consumption coughing up blood deciding to die on the death bed. You see the painter who we are able to see as if he were trapped in a small room looking through his painting unfortunately a spectator to the bed's meals. The bed has a dark sense of humor and we see this through it's allowing the painter to live even giving him jewelry and other possessions once owned by eaten victims. One victim's skull grows bright red flowers not far from the basement housing the bed. The film features three young women who come across the mansion which holds the basement containing the death bed. The painterDave Marshmight just have a method to destroying the death bed but it will include a human sacrifice in order to resurrect the body of the one whose death caused it's hunger in the first place. Patrick SpenceThomas provides the soft depressing voice of the trapped painter narrating the film lamenting about his current situation telling us about past victims and often scolding the bed of it's predatory nature.A definitive genuine cult film..I expect it's status to soar now that DEATH BEDTHE BED THAT EATS has found it's way to an audience..such as myselfwho appreciates the bizarre and grotesque. The bed itself contains a liquid type of acid with an applecider hue where we see the objects and humans..struggling for naught consumed. Many might recognize a young William RussBOY MEETS WORLD THE UNHOLYin curls seeking after his runaway sister finding her in the basement zombielike and traumatized..of course Julie Ritter pretty much was this way the whole film in a trance barely uttering a wordwith them both trapped. In one of the film's most demented scenes Russ attempts to stab the bed only for his hands to get caught in it's grip the flesh acidified with only skeletal bones remaining the cartilage deteriorating. There's one lengthly attempted escape by a victim whose legs were caught in the bed almost out of the basement when it's sheets snatched her back into it's belly where she belonged. The film feels almost completely surreal as if we were watching a macabre nightmare unfold. Director George Barry often features gags regarding the victims who find themselves in the most unfortunate position choosing the death bed as their place of refuge..the painter gives us a recollection of all the various people who were eaten. There's really nothing like this movie anywhere it's definitely one of a kind.".

I really couldn't call it creepy at any point Every minute i was saying to myself what the hell is this bedfilm going to do next! I watched this with a friend that is in no way a fan of horror or B movies and even she was pretty into it. the effects were actually very inventive and the colors and atmosphere were quite good. it keeps a very consistent and even tone throughout most of the film albeit an incredibly ludicrous consistency and the acting wasn't TERRIBLE. I can see from the point that there are certain inconsistencies in the actions of the bed that make the suspension of belief damn near impossible but the film itself was such a unique and bizarre concept that that fact didn't really bother me. seriously for me this film hit that realm of one i will not only never forget but i guarantee i will find myself thinking back on certain scenes in the future. does anyone else know of any other films in the inanimate objects that eat people genre? totally fantastic.".

You most likely know of it thanks to Patton Oswalt's excellent bit about it as well as Stephen Throwers essential book Nightmare USA. While watching it you wonder the followingWho is George Berry and what drugs did he smokeinjectsnort before writing and directing this movie?Is this a horror comedy? A combination of a horror flick and an art movie? A weird prank being pulled on the audience?What the hell am I watching?Death Bed really defies any explanation. I know that term is overused but it couldn't be truer than it is here. This truly beggars description. It is a horror comedy as well as art filmhorror hybrid. But the whole thing is so surreal it must be seen. The score sounds like the electronic bits from an old Candlemass album the acting is terrible and disconnected from everything the direction is surprisingly competent and the movie at times feels like a Jesus Franco moviethat is if his movies were intentionally funny.In the end there really is no proper way to describe this movie. Lord knows I've tried but really few movies are as odd unique or mind boggling as this is. See it...but you've been warned. This is also the only movie George Berry has ever done. He definitely left his mark on the exploitation genre with this I'll tell you that much.".

	schema:headline " A Very Odd Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a very odd movie. From what I gather a demon becomes infatuated with a woman and somehow magically conjures up a bed for him to satisfy his carnal desires with her. But the woman dies and that causes some blood to fall upon the bed and suddenly come to lifewith a desire to devour any human who sleeps upon it. I guess it's what beds that are conjured by demons do. Anyway in order to eat a person the bed secrets some type of yellow fluid which I suppose is an acid of some sort and essentially engulfs the person. However there are a couple of people who apparently intrigue the bed so much that it behaves very differently toward them. For starters there is an artist who painted a portrait of it and because of that he has been trapped behind the painting overlooking the bed. His comments are then given freely during the movie to clue the viewer in to what is going on. Trust me they are definitely needed. Likewise there is a woman who has eyes that resemble the woman the demon lusted after and as a result the bed is initially scared of her and bleeds inside whenever she is around. At least initially. Now if the plot wasn't weird enough the characters are pretty dumb too as they don't seem to sayor thinkvery much. They basically see a bed in the middle of nowhere and want to sleep on it. Naturally they get eaten and in some cases flowers grow on the ground outside of the building where the bed is located. I'm not sure why but perhaps it has something to do with Newtonian physics. Or maybe not. In any case like I said earlier this is a weird movie and because of that I recommend it only for those who either like bad films for some odd reason or have plenty of beer or other type of alcoholic beverages on hand. Failing either of these conditions you might want to skip this particular film all together. Below average.".

I had never heard of the film previous and any mention in conversation over beds that cause death I would immediately recall Johnny Depp's fate in A Nightmare on Elm Street.My curiosity was peaked with the premise. It sounded as ridiculous as Rubber 2010 possibly as outlandish as El Topo 1970 so it was a quick and easy purchase as I turned to Amazon to add to my collection.Death Bed is simply that. The plot surrounds a bed that eats. Our interest is mainly in the humans to which it consumes but apples bottles of wine and even a Pepto Bismol container are all part of the bed's diet throughout the 77minute running time. It eats through an acidic sudsy substance that overtakes objects laid upon it's mattress.The bed is fittingly located in a remote area of the countryside and we learn of its history and its thoughts ? through the narration of a spirit that is imprisoned within a painting kept in the same room as the killer furniture piece.Mostly the bed feasts upon travelers and more specifically during the midchapters on three vacationing women searching for a bed for the night.We could not ascertain whether writerdirectorproducer George Barry was looking to make a serious film or if he instead had designs on cinematic glory. But considering the film's overall tones and serious approach to the ridiculous premise we would suggest the intention was sincere. And with adult moments that included various scenes incorporating female nudity our case is that much furthered.Our appreciation for Death Bed The Bed That Eats might be more of a surprise than the film's plot points. We appreciated the movie for what it attempted and we enjoyed the crunching and munching Mr. King Size did on his adventures. Screened in 2013 we could hardly take it seriously. But it was with a satiric eye opened that we were kept entertained and we understood the cult epic that was unfolding in line with Eraserhead and Pink Flamingos.Yes even at under 80minutes the idea runs its course and outstays its welcome. And yes there were holes larger than pillowcases that brought out the WTF in us while screening.Still the title of the film doesn't hide what George Barry was trying to create. Our world might not be better having watched it but we are glad we now have a new conversation piece at parties that is designed to garner attention.www.killerreviews.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Never has the words hidden gem been so accurate. Bad movie lovers might search all over for the next hidden obscurity sometimes coming up short with stuff like Weasels rip my flesh but other times luck will prevail and you might end up with something like Death Bed then hopefully realizing it's not a bad movie at all it just has a bad title and not even a bad title but a humorous one that might throw you off but Somehow Death Bed obviously still fits into the bad category and there just ain't no way around that. With a vibe that's somber and empty Death Bed is a true masterpiece of lowbudget horror reserved only for those fortunate enough to appreciate such a dark shadow of a vision.Death Bed involves an incoherent yet intriguing relationship between a demon in the bed and the sympathetic ghost trapped in the portrait who only wishes he could spare someone from the awful fate of being devoured by the yellow suds.

A dark desolate vibe confusion an eerie subtle score and that dream quality that this masterpiece almost flaunts. Such a quality or vibe usually seems unintentional. Not only is it intentional but from what I've read Death Bed is based on an actual dream George Barry the director successfully transferred dream to film only a genius could accomplish such a task.Old mansions make for good quality horror as do portraits. Not sure what to make of the killer bed with its killer yellow liquid. A bizarre dream indeed. Also this isn't quite the brand of Bhorror I was expecting considering the cheesy title and all. Before viewing this Gothic gem I expected something more like Class Reunion Massacre. Now thats a bad movie if you've seen it you know what I'm saying. After considering all of the above I feel like Death Bed deserves eight stars but the mysterious charm of this one lingers long after the arrival of the internet era which counts for something. 610".

Bad movie lovers might search all over for the next hidden obscurity sometimes coming up short with stuff like Weasels rip my flesh but other times luck will prevail and you might end up with something like Death Bed then hopefully realizing it's not a bad movie at all it just has a bad title and not even a bad title but a humorous one that might throw you off but Somehow Death Bed obviously still fits into the bad category and there just ain't no way around that. With a vibe that's somber and empty Death Bed is a true masterpiece of lowbudget horror reserved only for those fortunate enough to appreciate such a dark shadow of a vision.Death Bed involves an incoherent yet intriguing relationship between a demon in the bed and the sympathetic ghost trapped in the portrait who only wishes he could spare someone from the awful fate of being devoured by the yellow suds.

Now that's getting back at its human companions! Furthermore it foams up in orange for whatever reason to absorb edibles lying on its surface including apples wine fried chicken and of course people. Again it's suffice to say that don't expect too much when you see what I guess is stomach acid  the final remains of anything that orange suds takes  dissolving only certain things. It'll drink the wine but the bottle's okay and it'll eat away at the chicken bone but the bucket's just fine. Heck the bed even replaces the unused containers. Hilariously at one point it downs PeptoBismol. I had to laugh at that one. I don't think they really wanted you to take any of this seriously. It's low budget and it's extremely easy to see where they cut costs and saved oodles amounts of money. I thought in a world where there can be a killer 'Lift' and a 'Blood Beach' this 'Deathbed' might be amusing to watch. For reasons that might involve cost 90 of the film is voiceover no one screams or shows extremely low signs of frightconfusion on why a bed would attack I can think of one  and I never was one of those kids that jumped on the bed and you'll have to suspend your disbelief beyond belief. A victim loses all flesh on his hands barely saying ow. Only one scene that went on too long was minutely tense  a woman attempts to crawl away only to be dragged back using a sheet.

DEATH BED has many recognizable elements of thepast but displays a wholly unique and original storyline.As a story DEATH BED is an amazingly simple yet originalvision something which only oneinathousand independent releases will manage to accomplish. This unassuming film has its technical flaws but overcomes them all with a cast of beautiful nonactorsand lost creepy locations a true 1970s independent classic. DEATH BED also displays a unique subversive 3dimensional personality a deep and continuous layering of dream images and ideas that lend it a funhouse type of construct. The passage of time told in flashbacks and historic time travelogues the bed with its sinister black humor the rich yet understated symbolism used within its imagery. Most pleasing is the image of Aubrey Beardsly the suffering artist forever trapped inside the frame of his own painting as he comments on and fondles with the murdered victim offerings gifted to him as love offerings by the demented bed's spirit.  A sick refrain and wonderful element metaphor for the trapped artist  Nothing but the weirdest in POE or MALLARME can equal that. Anyone who values the spirit of independent cinema and craves the multilayered symbolist experience or craves the Surrealist concept of convulsivebeauty and the Gothichorror leanings of low budget exploitation filmmaking will dig this totally unique vision. A simple and fun film with deliciously deep psychic undercurrents. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. ".

	schema:reviewBody "Death Bed The Bed That Eats 1977 out of 4 Hear me out. A bed that is possessed by a demon eats anyone who gets on it.Yes that's pretty much the story of this film which was written and directed by George Barry. This one filmed turned out to be the only film Barry ever did and it's certainly unlike anything else out there. I've read several reviews about this film including a few in books that discussed the worst movies ever made. I also read about it in Stephen Thrower's Nightmare USA where it was given a different point of view. Personally speaking I can see why some would call it one of the worst movies ever made but at the same time you have to admit that the film is original and it does contain some fresh ideas.DEATH BED THE BED THAT EATS is a very strange and surreal movie. There's a certain European feel that hangs over it and there's no question that it has a certain atmosphere that is hard to explain. The entire idea of a movie about a bed that eats people is ridiculous but at the same time how many times do you watch a horror movie and then bash it for being the same old thing that we've seen countless times? You really can't say that about this movie because it is original and there's nothing else like it.Obviously when you're dealing with a movie about an eating bed there's not too much that can be done in regards to a story. There's very little plot here and the majority of the running time are just short vignettes that have a variety of people show up at this castle sit on the bed and get pulled in. The special effects certainly aren't anything great with the bubbles coming up and then we get a cutaway of the people inside the bed. The visual images of inside the bed are decent for what they are.The performances are pretty much what you'd expect out of a lowbudget exploitation movie. There's some decent blood throughout as well as some nudity so the director at least knew how to build up the movie. I'm not sure if it was accidental or not but I did find stuff here to enjoy. It's certainly a very weird movie but I thought it was at least mildly entertaining.".

Basically a demon took human form years ago for a woman the woman died or something the demon cried blood the blood fell on the bed the bed is now possessed and it now eats. Along with fruit flowers and chicken it also has a taste for people. The people can range between horny teens mayors gangsters servants or professional orgy throwers. There's also a sick guy who the bed ate but put his soul behind a picture in the room.Most movies let you figure out the plot through exciting action. Death Bed takes another path it basically tells you through narration exactly what's happening while slow dull murder scenes take place. Also I must say everyone who's eaten by the bed are surprisingly quiet. I would think if a bed is eating you through the ways of a 5th grade science fair experiment it would sting a little. I guess nerve endings weren't invented until 1981 or so.The story is wacky the direction is slow and pretty awful the sets are sparse the acting it fairly painful and the brother is one of the unintentionally ugliest actors I've ever seen. Probably would make a great party film if alcohol and smartasses are involved. Certainly one you shouldn't miss.".

First off let me say that I consider myself a bad movie connoisseur having sat through my fair share and being a huge fan of things like Mystery Science Theater 3000 and Cinematic Titanic that showcase and make fun of bad movies...So I ordered Death Bed on Netflix. I have to say the movie is almost exactly like I suspected it would be. I had a hunch this being a 70s movie that there would be some nudity and indeed most of the women in the film are naked at one time or another. The movie is slow tedious and weird but it delivers EXACTLY what the title says a bed that eats.The bed does eat. It eats a wide array of things not just people. This is the sort of SO BAD IT'S GOOD cult classic that comes around once in a lifetime. Much like the equally so bad its awesome Manos The Hands of Fate except this one makes a little more sense and does deliver some decent gore...All in all I can't say that I'm disappointed though the movie was by no means good... I'm having trouble rating it out of 10 it's just too darn weird to give a numeric rating to. I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a 100 unique movie. They don't make em like this anymore... in fact they NEVER did.".

I have to say the movie is almost exactly like I suspected it would be. I had a hunch this being a 70s movie that there would be some nudity and indeed most of the women in the film are naked at one time or another. The movie is slow tedious and weird but it delivers EXACTLY what the title says a bed that eats.The bed does eat. It eats a wide array of things not just people. This is the sort of SO BAD IT'S GOOD cult classic that comes around once in a lifetime. Much like the equally so bad its awesome Manos The Hands of Fate except this one makes a little more sense and does deliver some decent gore...All in all I can't say that I'm disappointed though the movie was by no means good... I'm having trouble rating it out of 10 it's just too darn weird to give a numeric rating to. I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a 100 unique movie. They don't make em like this anymore... in fact they NEVER did.";

And yet there is a lot more background story to this film then one might suspect.Okay so the main plot is about a bed eating people and food but there are also a few subplots. I won't spoil them for you but they're a nice touch.Sadly the acting in this movie is very mediocre. The fact that most dialog is not even spoken by the actors doesn't really help to improve the quality of the movie as a whole.Because there is a lot of voiceover work. The thoughts of characters are also revealed to the watchers. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't.The effects are fine. Sure it could be a lot better if you compare it with today's movies. But you really shouldn't just judge the movie as it is and don't take it too seriously. You have to admit that a killer BED is quite creative. If you are easily spooked don't watch this movie. You might never want to sleep again...Death Bed The bed that eats is a strange horror gem with a low budget but I'd still recommend it to fans of horror movies.In conclusion I give this movie a 7 out of 10 stars for it's creative story and unexpected twists here and there.".

I think the directorproducerstar had those same questions and he agreed with himself to not worry about it then he told himself to just act through the uncertainty. When I came into work on Monday my manager asked me how the movie was and I will tell you what I told him. It was like driving up to a railroad crossing and seeing a passenger train full of orphans about to hit a tractor trailer full of kittens you know its going to be horrible but there is no way you are going to not watch to the end.By the way you may ask why I gave it a 10 star rating. Take it for what it is and its fantastic! It is no Poltergeist nor is it Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas but if you combined ideas of the first with the vision of the second and did this in the 70's you would be right about at Death Bed The bed that eats.".

	schema:reviewBody "On watching Death Machine I had no real idea what to expect other than a SciFi movie. I'd heard it mentioned in the same breath as Hardware a film I love dearly and had seen Norrington's League of Extraordinary Gentleman and Blade so checked it out. Death Machine is an efficient exciting slice of scifi action with more or less everything one looks for in the genre.The first thing that hits with this movie is the look. Every frame oozes pure class and the production design is flawless. From Jack Dante's hellish office through to the Death Machine itself everything has been designed to a tee with all elements gelling together like clockwork. Production design is often an area cult movies skimp on and to see such painstaking work will fill anyone especially cult movie buffs with a sense of glee.Second thing is the wonderful cast. Just as the design was obviously a labour of love so was the casting. Everyone is just right for their part and acts with great gusto never jolting the viewer out of the film world. Main players Ely Pouget and Brad Dourif a personal favourite turn in performances of a calibre rarely seen in the cinema let alone a straight to video title both more watchable than any Hollywood star or starlet I can think of. The supporting cast are fantastic too.There are a few unfortunate aspects to the Death Machine though. Firstly the movie is long for an action movie longer in Britain than America strangely and therefore may not appeal to the 'quick rental and a takeaway' crew that these movies normally filter down to. Secondly the movie has unfortunately dated a little purely due to the fact that the blockbuster action genre took a turn for the worst somewhere around the release of The Fast and the Furious and they therefore don't make 'em like this anymore. I had no problem with this having been brought up with the movies of the 80s and 90s but newer film enthusiasts may find this a tricky movie to get their heads round as a result.Still as always with good STV titles your perseverance and curiosity will be firmly rewarded if you take a chance on this. It's a brilliant movie and shouldn't be overlooked as one of the better scifi movies to come out of the 90s. Add to that the fact that it's recently been reissued at a budget price in my native UK and you have the makings of a bonafide rediscovered underground classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Death Machine is a film which really surprised me. I was expecting a gorefest with weak plot and even weaker acting. That was until I found out it had Brad Dourif starring in it who is in my opinion one of the best actors ever. The film itself is not overly gory but is instead remarkably discomforting and surprisingly funny and thoughtful. It takes quite a while for any real action to start the beginning instead being used for interesting plot and character development sequences.Brad Dourif does one of the most wonderful acting performances of his life here as the childlike psychotic genius Jack Dante who develops the ultimate killing machine. Wearing a long black leather coat and having long black hair he looks perfect for the part and gives a genuinely creepy performance  yet still makes you feel sorry for him. He's also been given most of the best lines in the pretty fantastic script with many laughoutloud moments for the viewer It's cool here! There's tons of... stuff!.A note about the violence and gore the film has an 18 certificate in the UK and you would expect some pretty gruesome stuff for a film in that category yet there is surprisingly very little. When the Death Machine of the title gets to kill someone in most cases the death isn't seen at all and left up to the viewer's imagination. There ARE some fairly bloody moments but I don't think this film really deserves the 18 certificate I've seen worse in 15rated movies.The film remains constantly engaging has strong actors all round and is directed very well. A great script with quite a lot of comedy moments sets this film apart from other lowbudget scifi horror movies. Great fun.".

It takes quite a while for any real action to start the beginning instead being used for interesting plot and character development sequences.Brad Dourif does one of the most wonderful acting performances of his life here as the childlike psychotic genius Jack Dante who develops the ultimate killing machine. Wearing a long black leather coat and having long black hair he looks perfect for the part and gives a genuinely creepy performance  yet still makes you feel sorry for him. He's also been given most of the best lines in the pretty fantastic script with many laughoutloud moments for the viewer It's cool here! There's tons of... stuff!.A note about the violence and gore the film has an 18 certificate in the UK and you would expect some pretty gruesome stuff for a film in that category yet there is surprisingly very little. When the Death Machine of the title gets to kill someone in most cases the death isn't seen at all and left up to the viewer's imagination. There ARE some fairly bloody moments but I don't think this film really deserves the 18 certificate I've seen worse in 15rated movies.The film remains constantly engaging has strong actors all round and is directed very well. A great script with quite a lot of comedy moments sets this film apart from other lowbudget scifi horror movies. Great fun.";

Death Machine even though the name sounds trashy the movie itself is not.It's about a company named Chaank Armaments which does all sorts of experiments including testing 'techniques' on babies. Hayden Cale Ely Pouget the woman in charge of covering up for the companies tracks is being left in the dark about the real things happening in Chaank Armaments namely the afore mentioned experiments. Not only that she's being targeted by the prodigy child of the company who invents all of the flashy equipment they produce only not really targeted for death more targeted for 'mating' since she has a dark past of her own. Jack Dante Brad Dourif the prodigal child then proceeds to take whatever steps necessary to get his 'prize'. And all of this happens on the night some ecoterrorists well some low cookoff of them anyhow decide to expose Chaank for what it really is. Add a mechanical monster some comical scenes and voila you have Death Machine a brilliant little.. well. SciFi Splatter movie. I have to admit I only rented the movie because it starred Brad Dourif which I think is a brilliant actor. He played in various movies Alien  Resurrection The Prophecy III series Star Trek  Voyager and even a game Myst III  Exile all in which he put down a fantastic performance even when the movie or series wasn't upto much good. Voyager Alien 4 and The Prophecy 3 for example If I had ten thumbs I'd put them all up!".

He'd like to attract a girlfriend so he's fashion conscious with a rock and roll goth hippie Rastafari vibe to his look. He's really attracted to Hayden. He's an enthusiastic owner an adult publication she appeared in in her younger days. He's quirky but he does his best to win her heart with a great sense of humor trys to earn her trust. Then Scott trys to arrange to get Hayden killed so Jack takes the creep out with his death machine. Hayden doesn't know that Scott got what he deserved and that Jack saved her life she thinks he's crazy. Before Jack can explain fully the Eco Terrorists who may just be after 350 billion in master soft wear bonds!  AROO AROO AROOHA! bust in and point machine guns...Jack understandably sicks the death machine on them preserving Hayden just by surveillance and lifting his finger off the deadman's switch on his remote. The director TRICKS us! He trys to make us despise Jack by tricks in the story and casting bizzaro Brad Dourif as Jack. Mr. Dourif was born in 1950 but they try to make him look like 25using a wig in 1995. This makes him creepier than he already is. Plus he's a hacker. I think there are more than a few of us online who hate the word. This film was almost preinternet so new viewers will hate Jack more than 1995 viewers. The first death machine murder is foisted on Jack but there's no proof of his involvement and no real exploration of the circumstances of the crime. The Hardmen project doesn't kill it's participants or erase their minds permanently in fact they may be paid blackopps recruits in my opinion. In the last scene we think Jack is killed by his own death machine but he couldn't have been.. since he knows it only attacks those who fear it! So what we have is an absolutely brilliant script that fools the heck out of us plus it is a very poingent love story as well intentioned Jack ends up like Romeo ended up.but not really! A lot of the camera work in the film is original and outstanding. I think this film owes more to Bladerunnner than any other film in look and soundtrack. If they cut or re shot the cop cut a line or two here and there or voiced over them we'd have a popular masterpiece.  Rachael Weisz has 10 seconds in this film. A close up of her face with 4 lines in her British accent and black hair. Very pretty. I love you Rachael...you love me too right???".

The costume design on the Hardman suit was very good for a low budget film. The camera work was really good especially in certain scenes where several emotions are caught in them. The movie features a good plot and believable tech for the year it takes place in. It does feature some cheesy lines in a couple of parts but other than that its dialogue is strong.

	schema:reviewBody "Quirky little scifi flick that has its share of goofy charms. Unfortunately though Death Machine goes too far in a few categories resulting in an eyerollinggroan instead of the genuine amused chuckle.  It doesn't quite nail the blending of two genres appropriately nor is it entirely effective but it does an okay job.  The movie does wear out its welcome by the time the final act starts.The Death Machine aka the WarBeast didn't set well with me.  Kind of a mechanical terminatorish Alien with autisminspired hypertwitches with its claws reminding me of the guy from Cube for some reason.  It's not that the thing looked unrealistic it's the fact that it moved like a chihuahua on a coffee high.Also the character suited up in the super soldier gear went a bit too far over the top with his Unisolfromhell impression.  Every now and then I found myself chuckling at him or his comments but for the most part I think he should've pulled back just a tad.There's a few others but I'll just comment on one more that bugged me.  The alltooblunt reference to famous directors giving characters the same first and last name or in a 'clever twist' swapping 'em around . . . I really think references are more effective when they're subtle and not glaring at you from the screen with a big red blinking light. The tongueincheek approach and goofy nature and the fact they walked a thin line of parodyseriousness didn't bother me . . . I just felt they didn't do too hot a job of walking that line and frequently went overboard on the parody side.On the plus side everyone feels right in their appointed roles and the production valueeffects are for the most part appropriate.  Ely Pouget and Brad Dourif are the stars here they play off each other nicely.  The Dante character would've come across as incredibly lame in the hands of a lesser actor but Dourif gives Dante a very unique aura of childish menace and pulls off one one the performances and creating probably the best character in the film.Pouget is fun as Cale constantly bouncing her chivarlous and noble comments off the demented Dante. The humor in Pouget and Dourif's performance comes about from their seriousstraight forward delivery.  Despite the wackiness surrounding them these two characters are probably the most grounded in reality . . . which is weird sad and entertaining at the same time and well you have to see the film to understand.If material has to be 100 believable for you to like a movie . . . why do you still watch movies?  Death Machine is a movie where you suspend your belief just to sit back and embrace the corniness as it pokes fun at its big cinematic brethren . . . I just wish it did a little better job of it throughout the whole movie.  Oh well it was worth the rental price.".

Unfortunately though Death Machine goes too far in a few categories resulting in an eyerollinggroan instead of the genuine amused chuckle.  It doesn't quite nail the blending of two genres appropriately nor is it entirely effective but it does an okay job.

However no matter how hard it tried to be a great movie it only succeeded in being ok. I gave it 710 bc it has a real effort to it. So stay with it and you'll probably enjoy it.The production was reasonable. The effects were fair to very good. The direction and editting were very good. The writing was weak at first but improved in the middle to the end. The acting especially toward the end was believable. The sound track was well done.So overall I think this movie is lacking something  it's look is cheap. E.g. it's name DeathMachine is a poor attempt at being scary. Maybe War Beast would have been better? And so I think it's the cheapness of the cinematography  it didn't look professionally made  that weakened this otherwise good movie.Kudos to the writerdirector Stephen Norrington Zafoid".

The renegade inventor Brad Dourif recreating his Wise Blood character in part is also insane and eventually the Warbeast is let loose. There's also a neat sequence where the Warbeast battles a human cyborg reminiscent of Alien 2 seems to be intentional. The Warbeast resembles a mechanical Alien and Scott Ridley is a character. Many other characters named from film personalities as well.A little sluggish at first but really makes up for that later in the film. Also probably not enough of the Warbeast slaughtering folks visible for some gorehounds but what there is is well done. Seems like they were about two characters short to really create a good rampage by the Warbeast but budget constraints notwithstanding they did a very good job overall.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to be honest I really wasn't expecting much when I hit the play button for 1994's Death Machine. At the very least I thought it might be good for a few unintentional laughs like many directtovideo films are. But what I got instead was actually a pretty entertaining and thrilling scifi gem. The story takes place sometime in the distance future where a corrupt weapons corporation has come under fire for the deaths of several people when one of its killer robots malfunctions and goes rouge. As a result a new CEO by the name of Hayden Cale the beautiful Ely Pouget from 1991's revival of Dark Shadows is brought in to clean things up. But she soon gets more than she bargained for when she crosses swords with the person who really calls the shots eccentric and psychotic weapons designer Jack Dante played by the voice of Chucky himself Brad Dourif. Once he realizes his power is being threatened Jack does what any twisted weapon designer would do Build and unleash the ultimate killing machine on the corporate executives! Things only get more interesting when a group of peace activists break into to destroy the headquarters only to get sucked into the nightmare instead. From there it's a battle of survival as our friends navigate through a treacherous high rise building with the death machine hot on their trail.It all might sound a bit cheesy and truth be told it is. However it is the good type of cheesiness the kind that is charming and can only happen when the right combination happens. A big part of that combination is the actors involved. Clearly this is not the most Oscar worthy plot ever written but that doesn't stop everyone involved from giving everything they got to their roles especially Brad Dourif. With his constant on screen charisma he is able to breath life into a character that is both insane and yet fascinating as he plots murder and plays with his toys. Ely Pouget plays the strong female character with great relish as she struggles to overcome the situation she's in. One should also congratulate the actors who play the peace activists John Sharian and Martin McDougall since we come to actually care about them. And of course what good would a movie about an ultimate killing machine be if it didn't include a good kickass machine to go with it and man do we get it here. I don't won't to reveal too much about it since that would spoil the surprise. All I'll say is that in a genre that has seen more than its share of killing machines the filmmakers here manage to create something unique cool and from your worst nightmare to boot! Plus the movie has good crisp direction from director Stephen Norrington. Plus there is that intangible movie magic at work here that only makes things all the more better. So if any of this sounds to your liking give Death Machine a try if your someone who likes cheesy but good flicks you won't regret it.".

It's about a company that is illegally on working weapons made out of humans by resetting their brain while their mastermind is working on something very different in the background. First of all. The acting is great on all parts. No matter if it's Ely Pouget who gives her Hayden some real depth and still shows us what a real badass of the 80ies and 90ies looked like. With Carpenter and Ridley we have 2 characters that we are supposed to hate and we kinda do. We just also love them for their craziness. But the real star of course is always Brad Dourif. He just needs to enter the room and within seconds he already got everyone into his role. He is pure over the top crazy but it is just awesome as you can see how much fun he had. The most important thing besides that are the effects. No matter if we are talking about the gore which is rare but effective or stuff like the monster. The effects are great and still look great today. With the score the camera and the fast cuts this creates are very nice atmosphere that lets you fear for characters and celebrate Dante whenever you see him.All in all this is a really great movie that you should already just watch if you are a fan of Dourif in any way or if you are into horror at all.".

Now there are some character issues I mean these peace mongers don't understand without weapons certain Governments of this world would walk all over you and steal you basic human rights. Also some of the dialog in the movie is a tad on the corny side. But I love WARBEAST. That is one cool robot monster and I for a party of one would have loved to see a DEATH MACHINE 2 WRATH OF THE WARBEAST. But it's not to be. Anyway I give DEATH MACHINE...8 STARS!".

The special effects budget seemed to stretch to some dodgy lighting effects and an abandoned warehouse.

I saw him again so I couldn't stop myself from finding out who he was I saw at least 5 music videos on you tube about this movie which made me order it. Now I have more than 50 of his films and will keep collecting until all of them sit in my basement with my movies. Highly recommended if you like the cheesy scifi or horror movies like Hardware although I did not like hardware because dogs died in it. It is being sold very cheap on amazon and is worth 789675 to me. Although I bought it for less than ten dollars.".

I was rooting for the lead character from the word go and Bacon did not let me down. Death sentence was a great thrill ride from the emotional opening credits to the chilling conclusion. At times it was brutal gory n depressing. The music by Charlie Clouser Saw series The collection Resident evil extinction was very effective at establishing the proper mood. It has some hard hitting action fantastic foot chase some amazing gun fights n some unique death scenes. The soundtrack is very depressing and moody and helps set the tone of the film. Its directed by James Wan Saw Dead silence Insidous Conjuring Fast n furious 7. Nice cinematography by John R. Leonetti Conjuring Insidious. It's based on the book sequel to the original Deathwish written by Brian Garfield the author of Death wish.".

Some of the dialogue was cheesy but that is what makes it great.The only problem I had with the film was the detective role. She seemed to serve zero purpose whatsoever. I am not taking away from the acting done for that role. But every scene she was in was slower and just did not fit with the rest of the movie. Other then acting as a very short winded inner monologue for Bacon's character all she did was say no no your safe they're dead and no. We all knew where this movie was going we didn't need the attempt to turn into a crime drama. If you did not like this movie you went into it expecting the wrong thing. This is a revenge movie. It had no supernatural parts. When someone was shot they bled a lot and they were in pain.

Kevin Bacon gives another grueling performance with some new raw material under his belt. The action is this film was very surprising and extremely entertaining to watch minute after minute.

And if a policewoman would know you did it she'll just tell you it's not OK.Your friends at work would never ask you why your hand is all wrapped in bandage and is bleeding. But if you want to be sure  put your hand behind your back.Working in an office would put you in better shape than any gang member.There is no bullet in the world that can hit Kevin Bacon  unless he's running in slow motion or found in red lighting environment which tends to make him vulnerable.Kelly Preston never learned what overacting means.If you secured the entire house and locked all the windows it's OK to open the door to whoever rings the bell.If you're working in a hospital it's good to tell a joke to someone whose entire family has just been murdered.If you're working in a bank it's good to tell a joke to someone who draws all his savings.If you're working in a bar you would never believe that anyone else speaks Spanish.Always read the instructions before using a weapon. It will also teach you how to shoot.Having your son in hospital would give you immunity when murdering bad guys.It's important to shave your head before going to kill your family's murderers.If you're going to crash into another guy's car don't put your seat belt  it's for puies.Mutilation is supercool.Even Kevin Bacon can't save this movie from James Wan's direction.110 Hilarious movie.

Nick Hume  his son Brendan stop at a gas station one night and a violent turn of events transforms Nick into a maelstrom of fury...Asking the question of just what lengths we would go to to look after our families Death Sentence is merely following on from the likes of Death Wish and Eye For An Eye. But here the violence is upped to such a gruesome standard it creates maximum impact. Yet it's not the violence that leaves the lasting impression it's the descent of the main protagonist that terrifies the most. A humble and decent man spiralling out of control done down by the system he finds darkness within him that he surely didn't know he had.Some sequences here are excellent and well staged by director James Wan and he shows considerable skill with his fluid camera. But these things tend to get over looked in a film of this type. Elsewhere although we are asked to swallow the impossible for one too many occasions and the cops are stupid beyond belief the film does find a couple of narrative tricks to also keep it out of formulaic tedium. Kevin Bacon deserves better than this for sure but he's great in the dual role and as revenge thrillers go in case I haven't violently rammed home the point yet this really hits the mark.

If you are looking for a best picture candidate you will not find it here. However it is a very entertaining engrossing movie that will probably not appeal to the squeamish. The movie fits right into the Parent Revenge mold quite well. The oldest son is killed by gang. Dad avenges death. Gang fights back. Dad goes crazy and kills gang members before the whole thing culminates in a final shootout full of graphic carnage. If you are looking for an insane action movie this isn't quite it. In particular the first half is very deliberate in trying to convey Bacon as a real guy trying to avoid violence but ultimately succumbing to it. I found this journey that he takes to be quite believe up until a scene near the end in a hospital in which he turns into Rambo. Rather than being moving it is slightly laughable. Then the movie turns into a straightforward albeit very well shot action flick full of gore and carnage. Many critics bashed the film for it's hypocrisy in having the movie condemn violence while later depicting it in stylish perversely entertaining detail. However I think this was justified by a gang leaders quote at near the end of the film. Look at you he says to Bacon. You've turned into one of us. The man is right. The gang leaders have slit throats and shot heads. But so has Bacon. He is a lesser of two evils to be sure but an evil none the less. While this may be a cheap attempt by the director the make the film more serious it does work. It is true that Bacon has transformed into a kind of monster. I give great credit to Bacon's performance along with almost ever other actor. If a dark violent disturbing movie is what you are in the mood for this weekend skip Halloween and go see this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Good golly this is one bad bad movie. I must agree with one poster on the message boards Sitting all the way through such a dumb movie leaves one feeling pretty stupid.What's wrong with this movie? Well when creating fiction a good rule of thumb is to come up with some sympathetic characters  at least the main character should be someone with whom the audience can empathize. The plot should also be plausible. Unfortunately the main character in Death Sentence is a complete idiot and the plot is so ridiculous I cannot even come up with an adequate metaphor. If you are tempted to watch this movie please allow me to save you some time with this short summary. First the main character Nick Hume played by Kevin Bacon almost runs out of gas with his oldest son in the car and has to stop in a very bad part of town an irresponsible oversight that directly leads to the death of his son. Then rather than send his son's murderer to prison where he could at least take some comfort in the fact that the murderer would spend the next five years or so being forcibly sodomized he decides he's Charles Bronson and murders the guy instead.Thus Mr. Hume invites the wrath of the killer's brother and his drugcrazed gang of psychopaths directly leading to the murder of his wife and the critical injuring of his other son and himself  because apparently the best thing to do when you know a gang is coming to kill you is to just stay home and wait it out. Luckily he and his son are only injured because as lustful as this gang is for revenge they only put one bullet in each family member and don't bother to check if they are dead or not. When he wakes up in the hospital he does not cry for his dead wife or kick himself for being such reckless idiot. He spends a minute with his presumably dying son then goes out the hospital window to finish what he started. Remarkably the police do not think to look for him at his home which is the first place he goes and is also a crime scene. Neither do they try to call him on his mobile phone which he is carrying or look for his car which he is driving.Mr. Hume buys a bunch of guns gives himself a very bad haircut for no apparent reason and then sets about wasting the rest of the gang in a very graphic fashion shooting like Jet Li  pretty good for a stockbroker.Critically perhaps mortally wounded Mr. Hume goes home  where the police finally figure out he might be  sits down on his sofa and watches old home movies. The police tell him his son might pull through. The movie ends there but we can assume in a final act of idiocy that Mr. Hume dies thereby leaving his sole surviving son an orphan. Thanks Dad.In closing I suggest that if you need to see a revenge movie rent Death Wish instead.".

First off I love me some revenge films.From the masterful Park ChanWook's vengeance trilogy Straw Dogs or Dead Man's Shoes to the brutal I Spit on Your Grave or Thriller En Grym Film there is no genre that does it for me quite like revenge. So when I first heard about Death Sentence I figured it'd be worth a viewing Kevin Bacon murdered child director of Saw I expected it to be at least passable.Well I humbly stand corrected. I'm pretty sure if you are someone defendingchampioning this movie you are either a semiretarded or b you need to see a real revenge movie. Everything about this POS is so blatantly onedimensional that I'm amazed it doesn't slide off the celluloid it was filmed on...The victim's family doesn't seem THAT upset that their son was murdered there's no real passion about anything  it's all just very gowiththeflow. The courtroom scene is pure comedy gold with the 97poundweakling 'killer' smirking and leering at a prettymuchnonplussed Kevin Bacon. Bacon's character Nick Hume doesn't appear too tortured about losing his 'golden boy' okay he sobs in the shower once  and the murder of his son's killer seems almost spurofthemoment.As for the thugs they're all hilarious  a bunch of didn'tquitemakethecut extras from a circa1997 nmetal video shoot and should be filed under 'outdated badass' at Central Casting Come on tribal tattoos and facial piercings!? What are they a MySpace 'gang' who still listen to bands like Staind or Disturbd or some other group of notalents who can't spell either? And look there's Johnny Goodman! Just a day or two before seeing this I was thinking to myself 'Why haven't I seen John Goodman in anything good lately?' I guess now I know why he's way too busy making turkeys like this. The oneliners aren't clever not even in a juvenile way and one line of dialogue Fear is for the enemy. Fear and bullets. is ripped almost wordforword from James O'Barr's The Crow another epic revenge story turned into a lousy movie.As for the acting? Kevin Bacon is the only one who almost pulls it off but only almost.Kelly Preston? Obviously not she can't even act like Travolta isn't gay.Goodman? Nope. Sorry.Garrett 'Youjustboughtyourfamilyadeathsentence!' Hedlund? Hey if I wanted to see a goth kid have a temper tantrum I'd just email Weston Cage that Little Debbie's had gone out of business  or that there was now a worldwide shortage of blueblack hair dye.I digress  you know how certain foreign markets tend to eat up some movies better than the film's own home country does? Well apparently my fellow Canadians love this movie because it has so many references to their national excuse hockey. The murdered son the one Nick Hume actually likes is a hockey player and wants to go to Canada and we see a cop picking up a broken hockey stick at a crime scene after Hume has killed one of the 'gang' members. I counted at least 3 or 4 references to hockey in this movie and I heard the movie was intended to be released here under the name Sudden Death Sentence Eh? Back to the topic at hand  this movie sucked. The bad guys get off way too easily same as in every other revenge movie. Nobody's cracked it yet  the revenge film that goes all the way. We don't even get to see Nick Hume waste Billy Darley in this movie. All that time wasted and there's not even a bloody payoff for the audience. What a waste of 110 minutes. James Wan whose first Saw film was at least memorable has dropped the ball horribly. He should instead stick to casting winners like Donnie Wahlberg in his movies and coming up with cheesy grossouts like the needle pit in Saw II. Truly the only death sentence in this cinematic abortion is the viewer's own  knowing that they are now 110 wasted minutes closer to their own demise.Enjoy!".

	schema:headline " Terrible movie";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie was terrible. I was fooled into watching because I think Kevin Bacon is excellent and the high scores on this site. So I felt compelled to help lower the average score and warn as many people away as I can.I like revenge movies. I liked concept of a man who's family is killed who turns into a supervigilante. I am willing to suspend a great deal of disbelief to enjoy this kind of escapist fantasy.This movie however was nearly unwatchable for me. Suspending disbelief is one thing but this movie pushed way too far.First of all as others have mentioned the policeda are laughable. They are so completely ineffectual and unwilling even to try to stop the criminals that it defied all of my efforts to swallow the plot. I mean if this were say ... Gotham city I might have been OK with it because the city depicted in that movie is not meant to be realistic. Rampant crime and corruption are expected which is why they need to use the bat signal every so often to call in a superhero.Death Sentence is placed more as a drama than superhero fantasy and that's why the same sort of attitude that the police department is powerless to stop the violent gang members is well ridiculous. Especially considering that there's only like 10 criminals involved in the entire operation. And as far as I can tell it doesn't go any higher than some greasy small arms dealer who works out of a garage. The cops can't deal with small time crooks and thugs?Here there is a gas station robbery and a ganginitiation homicide with the suspect who is id'ed by a witness and is then hit by a car outside the gas station immediately afterward. The DA can't win this case? It's a Tee ball case he should be hitting it out of the park. The defense will ask you questions like when was your last eye exam or what do you have against inner city youth. Really? These are concerning questions that might sway a jury? Again laughable.And the idea that 2 police officers are murdered and the PD hasn't organized their own hunting party for the criminals is just plain stupid. 2 police officers murdered and the best that the police can do is to 1. station a guard outside bacon's room to stop HIM from doing anything? and 2. blame him for the death of his family. Huh.The problem as I see it is this. The police in this movie weren't meant to be you know policemen. They were written as a foil to the protagonist an additional hurdle that he had to overcome. It felt like this was based on a bad comic book.It felt like the screenplay was written by a 13 year old with no exposure even on TV? to the actual real world. Sure in this world there is corruption there is incompetence. But it's not this open not this blatant and not this systematic ... at least in a major US city when the murder victim is the son of a senior VP of an insurance company. And especially not if the criminals are just a bunch of drug using gas station robbing thugs.Maybe if it was set in the wild west or some place that is normally perceived as lawless like a central American country as in Man on Fire or Gotham City it would be more acceptable. But this movie was trash ... immature and unrealistic to the point of being difficult to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been told over time through industry professionals sometimes in classes I've taken quotes from movie stars and writers and directors and so on that if you have a good script and a mediocre director you can still have a decent film but if the script is terrible it doesn't matter how great the director is but the project won't be able to fly. I still am not sure if James Wan is a great director  he really has a mixed record for me now that I've seen most of his films in brief Saw sucks Conjuring 1  2 are terrific and Furious 7 is... Furious 7! it has some extremedumb things and yet is brainless fun. But he does pull out a lot more directorially out of a script that is at times convincing and dramatic and other times is hackneyed revengesometimes cop drama.There's one virtuoso scene as critics like to call it  which is euphemism for 'impressive'  where Kevin Bacon is being chased by the thugs first on the street during day time they don't give a f so much they open fire in broad daylight with a lot of people on the street and then give chase through alleys inside a kitchen and leading out to a parking lot. Though at first it's cut fairly conventionally the way Wan is shooting this is inspired he used a 'rickshaw' type of device so the camera could lead in front of the actors at a faster speed plus on golf carts but when it gets into the parking lot Wan decides to go full Chanwook Park and do it in one shot. And it's done with extreme creativity both extreme and creative as Bacon and the other actors are running actually running and going through little patches of space to go one level to another until our antihero gets to the top level where his car is at.That last aspect of how he happened to be where his car is exactly at is convenient storywise that it's the parking lot where he works at he just happened to get back there while running in a frenzy nevertheless Wan has a strong visual idea and executes it with his crew wonderfully. And throughout much though not all of Death Sentence he is doing his best to make a to say it generously hit or miss screenplay fly as something harrowing and intense. The movie gives us a good look at a family  the dialog between this somewhat typical 'happy' family brothers infight a bit one son gets in trouble at school where mom happens to be Dean  and then the bad thing happens where one of the sons is killed in a gang initiation thing that looks like a gas station robbery and the killer is let go without much fanfare.The details of how this young thug is practically let go by the court for uh reasons is a little too tidy and convenient the gas station happened to be the only one in America without surveillance and maybe that's what I keep coming back to as a problem with the movie convenience things that the movie kind of lets go so the story can keep going forward. Other things like that is how the cop character Detective Wallis played by Aisha Tyler replacing a 50ish white guy which is cool! doesn't do more when Nick Hume starts to take matters into his own hands first going after the released killer in the middle of the night and then when later on spoilers two cops are killed while the main batch of criminals go through them to get into Nick's house in the middle of the night to settle scores. Like I know you're angry at Nick for making this situation worse and worse by starting s with criminals but now two cops are DEAD you have more important things to worry about now! So there's logic inconsistencies. Why recommend it? For me the gritty approach to the camerawork and the acting from the criminal characters and John Goodman in a small but pivotal role! connected and felt strong. I can criticize certain parts of the style like the choice of music sometimes it's alright other times it feels like it was picked by an uninspiredlazy music supervisor with some of these songs but Wan mostly got how to make this intense by going for 'real' and yet it's still a cinematic approach to the 'real' if that makes sense like it has a logical approach to how characters move through rooms and buildings and work with guns.The other aspect is Bacon. He really really brings it and if you like him generally this is him going full blown fieryemotional force. But there's a progression to it  he is playing a 'normal' guy fairly white collar suburban middle class and when Nick does this first violent act he's genuinely shocked in tears shaking. It's not something that looks and feels like a movie character that brushes things off and his vulnerability brings us closer to his experience as he digs himself deeper into vigilanterevenge drama even down to how he does a 'Taxi Driver' shavinghead bit which is much messier and all the better for it. All the while this actor brings it and finds the moments where nuance can play into it. He and Wan and a few other things elevate a hackneyed script which is the exception to the general principle of 'script script script'. In this sake I dug it. Usually.".

The Producers Messrs Booth obviously did not get any action in college and frequently fantasised about skanky scantily clad morons with nothing to recommend them but their silicon enhanced boobslips!!! The story line was regurgitated from a blender and you should be ashamed of yourselves for steeling several horror story lines and calling it entertainment!!! The claim based on true events... is nothing more than an actual true event stolen from a documentary which left 5 girls in Waverly Hills Sanitorium overnight! None of them actually died!!!! I am sure that the people who died from TB would be overjoyed at the use of their suffering and that of the nurses who committed suicide  you pigs!!!!! one last warning if you have not already subjected your poor poor brain to this attrocity then DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES  drugs won't help watch it!! Thank god NZs cinemas did not bother wasting box office time with this we are truly blessed  If you really want to watch horror with an intelligent and entertaining story line check out Peter Jacksons earlier movies pre Lord of the Rings!!!!".

I am sure that the people who died from TB would be overjoyed at the use of their suffering and that of the nurses who committed suicide  you pigs!!!!! one last warning if you have not already subjected your poor poor brain to this attrocity then DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES  drugs won't help watch it!! Thank god NZs cinemas did not bother wasting box office time with this we are truly blessed  If you really want to watch horror with an intelligent and entertaining story line check out Peter Jacksons earlier movies pre Lord of the Rings!!!!";

Imagine my surprise and secret pleasure when today I saw that it is now an exrental sale at the store for a staggering 4 Australian. I took it to the counter and was told that most of the staff have taken the movie home and watched it for free but none of them were able to watch the movie in its entirety it was THAT bad. I told him about the producers posting on IMDb and we had a laugh about it. He offered it free if I hired out an overnight movie so I agreed.I returned to the counter after picking out some other movies collected my new prize possession and returned home. On the way I thought about the different ways I could destroy the DVD  burn it smash it with a hammer axe it to pieces etc. I eventually decided to simply bury it. I knew the perfect place for it a twenty foot cylindrical hole that was left behind when we removed our old borewater pump I'm in rural Australia folks. A perfect fit Death Tunnel disappeared down its very own DVD Tunnel. As I was urinating into the hole I realized I had made a huge mistake.Now I've got a copy of Death Tunnel buried in my backyard twenty feet down. Whereas before it was simply a movie I hated and tried to forget about now its a movie I hate that I will never be able to be rid of. Its right there in my backyard. Twenty feet down. Untouchable. Preserved. I stare at the spot every time I pass a window like I murdered a person and secretly stashed the body out there. I've considered pouring petrol down the hole but I can't be sure if that will destroy it I've considered firing up the tractor and excavating it like a madman on a mission. Damn you Death Tunnel I should have just dropped you in the bin like the guy at the counter suggested.".

A bunch of flashy 9though admittedly well shot images. Its like the writers sat down and though of some things which creeped them out then scribbled down a script that allowed those images to be seen. I say script and not story because there really is no discernible story or plot going on. It jumps all over the place from a motherdaughter tale to a rich snotty girl all tangled up in the white plague. If asked to write a summary for the plot I would be left clueless as i truly have no idea. The fx minimal as they are are all decent enough but the person who really stands out the films only real saving grace is the production design. that person should be proud as the look of the film is definitely disturbing and creepy. Honestly though despite the often nude very attractive women this movie was a struggle to get through.".

Its like the writers sat down and though of some things which creeped them out then scribbled down a script that allowed those images to be seen. I say script and not story because there really is no discernible story or plot going on. It jumps all over the place from a motherdaughter tale to a rich snotty girl all tangled up in the white plague. If asked to write a summary for the plot I would be left clueless as i truly have no idea. The fx minimal as they are are all decent enough but the person who really stands out the films only real saving grace is the production design. that person should be proud as the look of the film is definitely disturbing and creepy. Honestly though despite the often nude very attractive women this movie was a struggle to get through.";

It was built as a hospital to fight TB back in the early 1900's. There wasn't a cure and morale was low so the death tunnel was built to export bodies out of the building without the living seeing them. Patients not seeing the high death rate were given a new hope. It's an amazing building with an intriguing past and is truly believed to be haunted.Many of the scenes the director portrayed are actual accounts of what people have said to have witnessed. He's taken these stories and attempted to derive a horror flick. For this reason and this reason alone I would recommend the movie.Now to get to the movie.First off the acting isn't brilliant. Kristin Novak's character Ashley is ridiculously obnoxious and the others are overdramatic. The storyline isn't put together well and it doesn't do a very good of explaining what is going on so it's hard to follow. If you know the history of Waverly Hills it's not as bad.I dug the movie because of it's history not because it's good. I would definitely recommend checking out the episode of Ghost Hunters SciFi Channel where they investigate the building or check out the documentary Also directed by Booth and aired on the SciFi Channel.The Waverly Hills Sanatorium is an amazing place and it's a shame that the movie isn't any better.".

Hilarious stuff.Shot on location at Waverly Hills Sanitorium the story goes that they didn't pay the owners for the use of the building. Whilst I feel sorry for the guys they ripped off it might end up being a saving grace for cinema if it puts anyone off funding these buffoons in future.Within ten minutes of the opening credits they are paying clunky homage to every horror movie that has been shot in the last 50 years.

Speaking of which  contrary to the contentdescription given here as far as i know this place never really existed the whole based on true events routine was a publicityscam. Back to the film It really isn't much more than a rather gruesomelooking filmstudent level horror flick which even fails to deliver any real slashermoments it almost looks as though the producers pulled their punches in that area which takes off whatever edge the movie might have had The cast gives the appearance of a bunch of Beverly Hills 91201 castingrejects halfdozen pretty dolls stumbling through the derelict hospital getting picked of one by one by the ghosts. Throw in the odd gratuitous toplessscene an old curse a sortofscary looking monsterguy in a gasmask and a lovestory between the main leads that is getting nowhere what've you got? Well Death Tunnel as is is  a movie that probably dropped out of someone's dark hole and which should really be rammed back in there.".

Speaking of which  contrary to the contentdescription given here as far as i know this place never really existed the whole based on true events routine was a publicityscam. Back to the film It really isn't much more than a rather gruesomelooking filmstudent level horror flick which even fails to deliver any real slashermoments it almost looks as though the producers pulled their punches in that area which takes off whatever edge the movie might have had The cast gives the appearance of a bunch of Beverly Hills 91201 castingrejects halfdozen pretty dolls stumbling through the derelict hospital getting picked of one by one by the ghosts. Throw in the odd gratuitous toplessscene an old curse a sortofscary looking monsterguy in a gasmask and a lovestory between the main leads that is getting nowhere what've you got? Well Death Tunnel as is is  a movie that probably dropped out of someone's dark hole and which should really be rammed back in there.";

Please oh please give us a plot. There is no blasted plot!! The title should have been The Amazing Breast with no Brains Tunnel! I kept hopping they would hurry up and kill the stupid girls and start the real movie. This DVD proves the old adage great breast can never make up for terrible acting and no stinking plot! That's what I always say anyway. I think I can say honestly that there is not one decent camera angle in the entire ordeal. It was just one silly camera trick after another. I didn't get the villain guy or whatever he or it was. Even the music was confusing with scary music at non scary times and vise versa. You might want to leave this one on the shelf. I would suggest poking yourself in the eye it's less painful.".

I actually liked the special effects in conjunction with the setting. They worked for me. The ghosts were scary the sanitarium was creepy the script was horrid. If the actors didn't have any speaking parts and used hand signals it would improve the movie. There are major goofs in Death Tunnel like Heather is running around barefoot but when she's on the roof she's wearing flip flops. I had a big problem with the corpses that breathed. Is it that hard to hold your breath for a minute or so until you're not on screen anymore? Back to Heather the heroine of the movie. I couldn't stand her and wish someone had pushed her down an elevator shaft or something so she would quit whining. I guess the movie wasn't the worst that I had ever seen but it was far from good.

A mysterious man a cool Lance Henriksen buys up his debts and wants Seagal to eliminate a few scumbags to work it off. So in fact Seagal's his new whipping boy.The film's not without it's fair share of clichs takes a few convenient shortcuts and some of the action scenes are a bit stiff butPistol Whipped as another Steven Seagal directtoDVD flick is really OK entertainment.Steve is actually pretty good in his role here looking like he's actually trying to act and he comes out a winner. He's getting a bit puffy again but he looks solid enough in the action department. Others are so so with only old pro Henriksen making any kind of impression.Kudos to the script as well. As said it's far from perfect but it does have a nice twist up it's sleeve and it gives our man a little better dialog than usual.For fans of Seagal this is a must. For others Pistol Whipped is still an OK way to kill an hour and a half.".

Eventually Matt's life takes a turn after an encounter with a mysterious man named blue that clears him of his debts and hires him as a hitman to take care of certain marks in exchange for clearing these debts.Overall I was rather impressed that Steven Seagal had it in him to make another solid movie after the followup of Urban Justice. The fightscenes were very solid and involved Steven Seagal in most of them not to mention a very impressive shootout at the cemetery near the end of the movie. Unfortunately the acting was not so stellar and Steven Seagal referred back to his ghetto voice in some parts which ruined his character in my opinion. Regardless the film was very good and tied his character together with his daughter very well and there were even some brief moments of humor thrown in as well.I definitely recommend this movie to a Steven Seagal fan or a fan of action movies in general Seagal has proved once again that he has still got it and I am looking very forward to his next flick Prince of Pistols.".

Lance Henriksen always plays a good part in anything he does. I was also happy to learn that this film was shot in Connecticut a few towns away from where I live. I'd like to see Seagal do more small acting roles like he did with Executive Decision. Hopefully he'll be back in the theaters soon. I would have paid to see this movie at a theater.".

It also has a pretty slick look and the action includes a wellfilmed car chase climaxing with a spectacular car flip and a John Woo  style graveyard shootout at the end. Seagal tries to play a morally ambivalent character which he does up to a point but the usual problems associated with his characters the invulnerability and the vanity are still present wait till you hear a girl's remark about a certain body part of his. He is still overweight and most of the fight scenes are blinkandyou'llmissthem but at least he is there doing them and doing them efficiently. The movie also benefits from a good supporting cast though Lance Henriksen should have had more screen time. Renee Goldsberry is gorgeous  tough and earns Pistol Whipped a few more points. 12".

	schema:headline " Steven finally putting effort for his fans";
	schema:reviewBody "I am a big Steven Seagal fan of his 90s movies but began to loose faith in him after Half Past Dead. That was a very impressive movie which did not deserve a rating of 3.9 out of 10. Plenty of action and humour plus some great kicks from seagal. After his StraighttoDVD features i began to lose faith his fights looked so fake because he had stunt doubles that looked nothing like him and his voice was dubbed pointlessly.Then came Renegade Justice or Urban Justice as US calls it it was a very decent action flick and made me see that he dozen't need to retire early. The fights were all done by seagal and dubbing was ignored. It was also a fun film to watch and a musthave for all seagal fans. What I mostly love about it is seeing seagal the way we use to know him in the 90s. Just no original plot.This film that I am talking about is the best seagal film I have ever seen. This is mainly because he isn't the hero in this film. There are no heroes in this film. He is an alcoholic excop with a gambling problem a huge debt and a neglectful father. It convinced me on what a depressing character he was.The soundtrack was brilliant. At the start seeing Seagal shooting in a cemetery while there was emotional music playing in the background made me see the drama in this film. The second scene where seagal and the priest are talking really described his character as not being some perfect hero but a more realistic character. These problems that he has is also his fault.The action was also brilliant as well. There is still mindless violence in this movie but that won't spoil your fun as the fight scenes are still realistic but they are not the reason why this movie is so great. Seagal also shows talent and emotion in his acting which is very rare as he is mostly acting with his fists and guns.This is the best seagal DVD movie yet. Mainly because it is something a little different than his others and is the most unique out of all of the films he has been in.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been loyal as a Steven Seagal fan. In high school Marked for Death and Out For Justice were Saturday movie regulars. Under Siege was an opening night event. I have reviewed most of the Seagal films on this website and have viewed them all multiple times. This past Saturday my wife and daughter left for the night...so I sat down armed with a 6 pack of Coors Light and Blast o' Butter popcorn and into my PS3 I popped in Pistol Whipped with very low expectations. Was I pleasantly surprised! The film moves quickly. The director takes some great camera angles...great soundtrack for a Seagal film......and seems to have a great sense of what older Seagal fans enjoyed so much about him as an action icon in the late 80's and 90's. The dialogue is on par with such Seagal classics as The Glimmer Man and Out for Justice. Seagal seems to have found his charisma...with the exception of 2005's Into the Sun his last 8 or 9 DVD's have lacked that main charisma ingredient. The writers decided in this film to make Seagal's character vulnerable mean and lacking good judgement. Something Seagal hasn't been in character for quite some time. This film has a few technical problems...mainly the ending shootout could have used a little touch up in the editing room...Seagal seems to have sunglasses on and off in the same breath of dialogue??? A few stand in scenes very briefon long shots...but nothing like the crap we as Seagal fans have scene in recent efforts like The Foreigner Attack Force and Flight of Fury. The akido scenes are great and well shot...I can only hope that Seagal has found his step again...I will still be reluctant to get excited as Seagal seems to hold a pattern...After 2005's acceptable Into The Sun we got Submerged which I thought was horrible. After 2006's Shadow Man which I enjoyed we got Attack Force??? The formula for Seagal's success lies in his ability to work within the means of the Direct to DVD market and its meager budgets to produce films like this one which will secure his fan base to push him back into theatrical contention. Time is running out for the aging star...but I strongly suggest you watch this film.".

I have given this the same as Shadow Man which isn't right really because its better Let down by some incoherent editing same with every Stevo film even his debut Above the Law this film actually has a decent story and the action scenes are good. There is a great climactic shootout in a cemetery at the end of the film which is really well shot the music builds up the narrative really well unlike Urban Justice which has an awful computer game style sound track. I hope Stevo keeps it up because this is above average even for a non Stevo fan....... STEVO!".

	schema:reviewBody "After the excellent URBAN JUSTICE it seemed that Steven Seagal had his work cut out to keep making good movies. Let me tell you from the getgo PISTOL WHIPPED is as equally good with despite it's lower budget better production values although i suspect Urban Justice was given a grittier raw look on purpose? Seagal plays Matt a disgraced ex cop who been sliding off the tracks since his suspension. He's been gambling and hitting the bottle and most importantly ignoring his estranged wife and daughter. It seems that despite his shortcomings Matt is still a proficient badass but he's more of a bad guy than he'd care to admit. Suddenly his gambling debts have caught up with him in the shape of a shady businessman great cameo by Lance Henrickson who offers to clear the debts if Matt will 'terminate with extreme prejudice' some wiseguy mafioso type. Being of dubious morals Matt undertakes this job fearing for the safety of his daughter and in true Seagalstyle opens up the required whupass on said contract. But it doesn't end there......Matt's new mysterious employer wants more people 'taken care' of....including his exwife's new husband a fellow cop and one of Matts friends But is his friend everything he seems?Seagal fans will enjoy this one as it give the stout sensei a chance to relax let it all hang out and play as in OUT FOR JUSTICE a scummy antihero who's far worse than the bad guys he's taking down. Yet there's a genuine warmth between Seagal and his onscreen daughter proving he can be a good natural actor when he drops his defences Seagal plays the part perfectly a crying shame he's been making duff movies in Romania when PISTOL WHIPPED is one of the lowest budgets he's worked with. Director Roel Reine has a good visual eye and if anything it proves that Seagal can work in the confines of a low budget provided as we've always known he ditches the 'wrong element' around him the 'yes' men These people have gladly cashed cheques as Seagal has been involved in some truly dire projects of recent. Good to see you back on track Steven....stick with directorspeople that give a damn.All in all PISTOL WHIPPED is a great Seagal biffemup thriller with it's lead showing as Stallone has done likewise that age is nothing but a number some of the fights here are extremely brutal and Seagal has lost none of his trademark speed or for that matter wit check out some of his dry dialogue....very funny for fans of the genre and it's comforting to see Seagal playing a flawed allbeit still untouchable character who's not a straightlaced good guy. Once again i have a SEAGAL movie that survives repeated viewing and one to show off to my mates. All in all Big Lee gives this great movie 10 out of 10".

He is divorced and has gambling debts all over town. A mysterious stranger buys all his debt in exchange for Matt's services. Which are to eliminate some bad guys. The final target is someone though who is quite close to Matt.So much so good. It sounds like a regular Steven Seagal movie. It's not though. Let's begin with the production values. Despite costing only about 10 Million  the movie looks pretty good. It seems that Seagal earned his was back in the states as his recent movies are no longer shot in Bulgaria or Romania but rather in the states. The camera work in this movie is top notch. Really stylish. The camerawork alone makes the movie look like it cost about 20 million more than it actually did. The score is also great. Not just for Seagal standards. It actually holds up even against real movies. The acting is also pretty good. In this movie Seagal doesn't look like he really doesn't wanna be there like he did in a few other DTV titles he did. The other extras are also above average. Lance Herniksens short appearance in the movie is also memorable. Like I said this movie looks good enough to be in theaters. Just a few little things here and there could be better. Overall it seems that Seagal got back whatever it was that he lost.So I give this 9 out of 10. I gave Indiana Jones 4 only a 7 out of 10. Both movies I rated in perspective to the previous ones.If you enjoy Seagal even a little you won't be disappointed with this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "thought this was a good Seagal film for a few reasons first off it is back to basics with immediate no questions asked action by the man in scenes when he is even remotely threatened. That is classic SS and a throwback to the early days like in Marked For Death etc so from that perspective fans should not feel disappointed. Also thought the inclusion of the guy who was in quite a few films in the early 90's the character Blue was a good one. He was in some real good films like King of New York and Sea of Love and it was good to see him in this film he comes over pretty well as some kind of mobster who clearly does not respect Seagal or even his Boss. Also thought the scene where Seagal tackles his ass in the house was good to watch always like seeing SS do fight choreography with actors who are not in the business for that reason. Storyline is OK perfectly acceptable to call in a debt from a lethal family man to knock off a few wide boys. All in all this is probably one of Seagals best 10 movies.".

For once he's not the whiterthanwhite superhero with a background in black opsspecial forceslaw enforcementenvironmentalismbeing a chef this time he actually plays a flawed character! which is a huge improvement over every other film he's ever appeared in where he's the honourable and unbeatable masteroperator. As the drinksodden excrooked cop Seagal is not exactly revelatory but this is the first film where he's actually bothered attempting to do anything different from his standard formula which sometimes works The Glimmer Man Submerged Into The Sun and often doesn't Attack Force really absolutely rotten to the core so i do commend him on that and also the fact that he has slimmed down considerably from the behemoth who was only filmed from the chest up in his more recent movies. Oh and he even attempts a few kicks in this one something we haven't seen since....hmmmm.....Seagal is supported by two people i never expected to see in one of his films Paul Calderon who'll be familiar to fans of King of New York and Pulp Fiction and Mr Lance Henriksen who sadly only appears in a few scenes. Both add an air of respectability to the proceedings. But this is a Seagal film not Merchant Ivory and it delivers well on the fightingshootingkilling front. An enjoyable load of nonsense but a bit of a comeback for Steven Seagal hopefully it'll end the cycle of appearing is tatty East Europeanset trash. Also please bear in mind that this rates an 8 out of 10 purely as compared against other Seagal vehicles not The Godfather for instance.".

Plus i can't help it i like watching this older rugged Seagal he's just Cool to watch.If you really want the best of Seagal's movie work then check out his old school Action Thriller Classic's like Under Siege 12  Marked For Death  Out For Justice  Hard to Kill  Nico  The Glimmer Man  a few other's but those are his main best movies!!!Seagal's Attitude  mean ways in real life sometimes tarnish his Cool Cult Action hero status but hey it seems no one is what you thought they were!!!Pistol Whipped is another straight to dvd action film like many other's that Seagal constantly brings out  sometimes there's a real good Gem among the Crap like his Belly of the Beast or his Driven to Kill or his A Dangerous Man among a few here  there that are scattered amongst the really terrible films  i know these are all cheap Bmovie films  I'm fine with that as i love a hell of alot of Bmovies so I'm usually probably to kind to alot of films that most people would find terrible or hate!!!Pistol Whipped is a good one of Seagal's it's a fun little dark action film with some cool fights  shootouts The Graveyard scene is really cool  a still tough  brutal ageing Seagal taking out bad guys  here Seagal plays a more troubled  flawed character who is deep in debt  loves gambling  gets in danger with some Criminals nothing special but an easy watch  it's actually entertaining.Also we have a Bmovie legend here as a bad guy the Awesome Lance Henrikson!!!I genuinely enjoy most Steven Seagal films  often i like some of the bad ones but hey they are good action entertainment.Here's a list of some very good DTV Seagal flicks A Dangerous Man The Keeper Belly of the Beast Out for a Kill Against The Dark Driven To Kill Kill Switch.I may have missed a few as i haven't seen all his DTV films.Here's some terrible ones of Seagal's DTV output Black Dawn Flight of Fury The Foreigner A Good Man Attack Force  Shadow Man but I've yet to see all his DTV films.As you can see by the lists that Seagal has actually made more Good or Decent Bmovie films than he has terrible films. I genuinely enjoy chilling out on a night with a Coffee  watching a Seagal film  most are his cheaper DTV films as you know what your getting  it's a joy to watch my old Action hero still out there killing off the scum of the world even if he's slower  more arrogant.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just watched Pistol Whipped 200820 years on from his debut in NicoAbove The Law Seagal puts in possibly his best acting performance as an ex cop alcoholic gambling addict who wants to reconnect with his daughter. Because it's a Seagal movie he is also going around killing people for Lance Henriksen. Seagal is unusually a bit of a loser in this. He seems to be trying to channel Michael Madsen in his performance but it is effective. Seagal isn't as obviously doubled here even though it's still clearly not him so the fights are not as bad but he is pretty big now and his bowling shirts do not help matters.If this came out fifteen years ago it would've been considered a solid Seagal effort as a mainstream theatrical release. It's right up there with some of his better ones. It is pretty light on action and is slower moving than your usual Seagal movies but the action really ramps up towards the last half hour the ending was a lot of fun too. Were any more of these made?? The ending certainly left it open to the possibility.This is Seagal's best DTV film in my opinion. His fighting and oneliners were top notch. Speaking of one liners there is a hilarious scene where Drea played by the lovely Renee Goldsberry has just spent an evening of bliss with a drunken Seagal. Drea is whining about the glass ceiling at work and how life would be better for her if she had a dck. Seagal chuckles and replies that he probably wouldn't have liked her as much if she had a dck especially if that dck was bigger than his to which Drea laughs and replies and I quote I don't think that's possible My son and I literally fell off our sofa in stitches. I'm pretty sure he inserted that line in there all by himself.Spoiler alert no one gets actually pistol whipped in the movie.".

The success here is that it actually manages to gather enough data and interviews to be transformed from an annoying propaganda from the filmmakers to an interesting propaganda from an existing minority that believes that there are alternative ways to deal with the Greek debt.An important choice in this process has been not to hide its political origin and destination. Debtocracy never claimed to be an objective account of the reasons that lead to the Greek debt crisis nor even tries to find people that disagree with the point of view it presents. On the contrary its depth comes from pointing out the global appeal of that specific point of view.I noticed that the other reviewers didn't like the documentary because they have political disagreements or believe that propaganda can never be interesting. But this poignant film can be put against the familiar media propaganda and can thus help everybody reach their own conclusions.If you have been following the course of popular American political documentaries of the last decade by journalistsfilmmakers like Michael Moore Alex Gibney Eugene Jarecki and Charles Ferguson you will be especially happy with this first Greek addition to a movement that despite its propaganda elements has brought social thinking to the monotonous discourse of news media.".

Travis agrees to the job but only if he can bring in his buddy Baxter Weller to help out. Even though Baxter is a nutty guy Wellington reluctantly agrees. What then follows is Travis Baxter and Diana moving from place to place in the woods as Katya Lewis Daniel Kulich and other baddies try killing them using various means but usually shooting. Most of the rest of the movie is this catandmouse game but there are a few twists every now and again to try to keep the viewers' interest. Who is the real DECOY? Sure Decoy may have some bigger names like Robert Patrick and Peter Weller and it may be shot well using picturesque Canadian locations shot in Regina and La Ronge Saskatchewan but don't be fooled this is just as dumb and runofthemill as many other DTV productions out there. It was clearly trying to be more upper crust and be almost theaterquality but ultimately doesn't get there and is a disappointment.There are some cool killings and the baddies have these futuristic wrist rockets that they use on their enemies but that's really the only noteworthy invention here. And that doesn't a good movie make. There are some utterly stupid timewasting romantic elements between Baxter and Diana for a while which don't need to be there. Diana is the clichd complaining woman dragged along into an adventure we've seen so many times before. On the other end of the female spectrum is Charlotte Lewis looking amazing with her outfits and highpowered weaponry. It's quite a change from her role in Men of War 1994. Robert Patrick puts in a personable enough performance but it's hard not to compare this to the awesome Zero Tolerance 1994 which is Patrick at his absolute best. Weller puts in a quirky performance with his pseudophilosophical dialogue and he's always good but Decoy as a whole is mediocre with tons of pewpew gunfighting scenes that don't really add much.Also on board as one of the baddies is Vladimir Kulich who has played the Eurotrash Bad Guy in such movies as Crackerjack 1994 Red Scorpion 2 1995 and Breach Of Trust 1995. We're definitely getting used to seeing him. There's also the prerequisite torture scene but this time the movie opens with it and gets it out of the way. But the problem with Decoy is every time it starts to get good it pulls back. It's almost like the movie has a fear of success.Decoy is ultimately wasteful with what resources it has and it never rises above your standard action premise.For more action insanity drop by www.comeuppancereviews.com".

On the other end of the female spectrum is Charlotte Lewis looking amazing with her outfits and highpowered weaponry. It's quite a change from her role in Men of War 1994. Robert Patrick puts in a personable enough performance but it's hard not to compare this to the awesome Zero Tolerance 1994 which is Patrick at his absolute best. Weller puts in a quirky performance with his pseudophilosophical dialogue and he's always good but Decoy as a whole is mediocre with tons of pewpew gunfighting scenes that don't really add much.Also on board as one of the baddies is Vladimir Kulich who has played the Eurotrash Bad Guy in such movies as Crackerjack 1994 Red Scorpion 2 1995 and Breach Of Trust 1995. We're definitely getting used to seeing him. There's also the prerequisite torture scene but this time the movie opens with it and gets it out of the way. But the problem with Decoy is every time it starts to get good it pulls back. It's almost like the movie has a fear of success.Decoy is ultimately wasteful with what resources it has and it never rises above your standard action premise.For more action insanity drop by www.comeuppancereviews.com";

Her father Mike Kevin Gage just happens to be the detective on the case and his partner Steve Christian Brett Harrelson convinces him to check out a club that specializes in piercing and scarification which is also the secret hideout for Captain Howdy Dee Snider also known as Carleton Hendricks who is the suspected cause of the disappearances. With the help of his cousin Angela Stravelli Amy Smart Captain Howdy is caught and brought to justice. After a couple years in an insane asylum he gets released back into the community and a local militia group led by Jackson Roth Robert Englund kidnap him and leave him for dead. When new evidence confirms that he may not be dead Detective Gage tries harder than before to stop him.The Good News As it gets more and more commonplace for people to chat online and in instant messaging the fact that this one was the first out of the gate to show the potential evils and dangers of the situation is a nice and original approach. Even though it deviates from it towards the end the original setup is pretty great. The ending is also pretty great and pretty exciting with a great bit of action in there as well. Most of the focus on this film is the discomfort one gets when exposed to extreme forms of scaring and skin piercing and it is a subject most get uncomfortable viewing. This is mostly played out in the psychical form of Captain Howdy who does look pretty creepy. His look though drives the film so I won't spoil it but it is a really disturbing and shocking look that will definitely get you a little crept out the first time his full appearance is shown.The Bad News This film basically relies on the belief that extreme piercing fullbody tattoos and scaring are scary images for the average person. If none of them are scary or frightening then most of the film's power will be lost. Besides that there really isn't a whole else in the film. It's not a traditional horror film in the slasher sense so for some it can be quite boring as there's no real jumps suspense or anything similar.The Final Verdict If any of the acts or ideas featured in this one are fears of yours this could be a pretty scary film. If not this can be a pretty dull experience. Otherwise it's pretty middle of he road and pretty forgettable.

Also I loved the fact that Robert Englund plays a character that is the exact opposite of his role in A Nightmare on Elm Street. Instead of playing the killer he is the leader of the mob going to find the killer. Krueger fans will know what I'm talking about. It's a brilliant and appropriate piece of casting that genre fans should appreciate. Overall the good outweighs the bad and I would recommend watching it at least once.

Strangeland would've be a complete piece of horror art at two hours. As it stands the running time is only an hour and a half.ExTwisted Sister member Dee Snider wrote produced and stars in this 1998 shockfest set in a small Colorado town. He plays Carleton Hendricks a crazed sadist who has psychotic ideologies on human evolution and a love for neardeath experiences. Hendricks is no pushover he's a pumped up sixfoot modern primitive. Someone who has tattooed and pierced their body to the very extreme. When he makes his first full appearance in the film it is a truly terrifying sight.Hendricks' main hobby in life is to share his spiritual awakenings with his kidnapped victims. He visits Internet chatrooms under the name Capt. Howdy and then invites people over to his house. They believe they're going to a party. Instead they find themselves in a house of pain and suffering. Hendricks sows their eyes and mouths shut and tortures them by sticking blades and hooks in numerous parts of their body. If it sounds sick it's because it is.One of Hendrick's victims is Genevieve the teenaged daughter of detective Michael Gage. Gage not only manages to save her but arrests Hendricks as well. Four years later Hendricks is released from a mental institution completely rehabilitated to the disapproval of the community. A group of rednecks led by Freddy Krueger himself actor Robert Englund decide to kill him. They fail and Hendricks reverts back to his old self.The rest of the film I'll leave to you only to say the conclusion is satisfying and will leave you in shivers. With the exception of Snider the acting isn't too good but it's serviceable. The direction is okay too. There are some humorous parts in Strangeland and they are very funny. I also loved the soundtrack it's awesome and worth buying if you love rock. Overall this is a movie worth watching. If you love lowbudget horror films with a sense of humor check it out.

A tortureloving maniac who seeks victims in chatrooms and calls himself Captain Howdy yep The Exorcist torments a detective when he takes his daughter. Then the maniac is arrested rehabilitated let loose after four years huh? in a nuthouse picked on by Robert England hung by Freddy and his hick buddies but then he's not really dead. So maniac goes back to terrorizing said detective who arrested him in the first place and promptly rekidnaps his daughter. Yow. I enjoyed this movie. The pace is all over the place but it never leaves you bored. Dee Snider Twisted Sister remember I Wanna Rock or We're Not Gonna Take It? Hell he was in PeeWee's Big Adventure is the loon who is obsessed with torture and flesh ripping and you don't get to see him for the first 45 minutes but when he does finally show his face you say to yourself oh yeah Dee Snider. The first 45 minutes plays like a freaky detective horror thriller with main characters then Robert England comes out of nowhere for about 20 minutes in a starring roleofsorts. The movie is fun for the average fan. It's an assault on the senses blended with cheese. Two good things at once. Features breasts punctured with torture devices flesh hanging by hooks and of course the Twistedest Sister of them all. Three stars.".

Kevin Gage is weak in the lead role of Detective Mike Gage but Dee Snider makes the film worth. With minor improvements and a different conclusion Capt Howdy could be a cult character. The sick story is excellent the special effects and the atmosphere are also great and this movie is better than for example the recent Saw.

It's also in no small part inspired by The Silence of the Lambs from which it steals at least one scene and Se7en and as with other movies that have taken inspiration from those movies such as 8mm Feardotcom and Saw took some flak for that too. The title is a stumper I don't know what it means and it doesn't seem to suit the movie well. The shocking cover image is well chosen though it might surprise some that a person's mouth sewn shut could be found in the opening scene of a movie from the early 1930s Murders in the Zoo.In truth it's not all that bad. A young woman is lured to a party through an online chatroom and an IM from Captain Howdy and her friend turns up dead with signs of body modificationinspired torture. A large septum piercing found in the trunk of her car provides a clue I didn't understand how it could have been accidentally left or why it would have been planted. The cop learns a bit about modern primitives I think there's a shot from the RE Search book of that name and online chatrooms still a danger to the unwary today.Somewhat surprisingly partway into the movie we get a four years later intertitle and the discovery of a second set of victims seems awfully convenient. The ending confrontation is disappointing.There are nods to other movies as well as when a group of neighbors tries to lynch the bad guy led by Jack Robert Englund. This is quite reminiscent of the lynching of Freddie Krueger Robert Englund again by his neighbors in the Nightmare on Elm Street backstory.I saw the version on video and am not sure how the unrated DVD might differ.".

It really started with Twisted Sister songs then Dee tried writing about a psycho clown but IT had that idea so Dee set about writing a horror film like Seven. Hey Dee! I liked this better than Seven.Strangeland is a really sick film. The protagonist played by Dee himself is a sicko named Carleton Hendricks aka Captain Howdy a deviant with tattoos and piercings galore he stalks young girls online and does really depraved stuff to them. Poor Geniveve Gage is the 1st victim. Note the actress! It ER's Linda Cardellini! What follows is really nasty and scary note the cauterization! But the film pulls a shocker early!Later on see Dee in Mr. Rogers mode! Perhaps the most frightening shot in the movie! Kevin Gage plays Gage and yeah he sucks. Actually other than Robert Englund delightfully playing a righteous redneck the acting stinks. And the director's idea of suspense is cutting to black every three minutes! Still the heavy metal soundtrack featuring Marylin Manson Pantera Coal Chamber Megadeth Twisted Sister and Snot is truly awesome. Buy it.Strangeland offers some great stuff and certainly doesn't stint on the horror though its not anywhere near as bad as I was led to believe. For you DVD fans Dee's commentary is every bit as disturbing as the movie! A really good horror flick with some very interesting twits and turns. I really have to agree with Robert Englund the truly frightening thing about this flick isn't the death its the suffering.. Cool!".

I personally loved the movie and everything about it.The acting in some places could be improved upon but the filming adds to the atmosphere where the acting can't. In some areas the dialogue is a bit cheesy and over dramatic but really what do you expect from the late 90s? Over all Dee did an amazing job in writing what I believe to be one of the most terrifying thrillers I've ever seen. It plays on the fears of many age groupsadult parents and children. Every parent fears that their children will get too involved with chat rooms and will meet strangers from the internet. And it does happen in the real world. And every child and adult fears being kidnapped and tortured against their will that happens too in the real world. Which is what makes this movie such a sensitive subject for many.My only warning is if you know you are sensitive to things such as strong violence visible torture and gore then you do not want to see this movie. If you are unsure about if this movie will entertain you then read as many reviews as you can ask people you know who have seen this movie and be prepared to turn the movie off at any time should you become disturbed.".

Dee Snyder needs to stay out of the horror movie business!  Probably the movie business altogether.  The movie starts out promising but goes downhill from there.  The bad guy Captain Howdy is laughable and the piercings and tattoos make you laugh instead of making you scared!  The actors in this movie are horrible and I'm shocked they ever landed parts in their lives.  I just found out the girl from Freaks and Geeks is the young girl who is tormented by Howdy and I think she was awesome in Freaks and Geeks but here she's just like the rest of them.  When it comes down to it she doesn't even have any lines in the entire film and her part is just a tiny piece of the puzzle.  The detectives in this movie are fake and both of them can't act for nothing. Like I said the start of the film is ok with an internet stalkermurderer played by Snyder but his character just isn't scary.  Not much in the movie is scary and most of it is just a way for Snyder to try to freak you out with horrible scenes of girls tied up naked with hooks going into their bodies etc.  I wouldn't waste my time on this movie.  It's a bad movie and an even worse horror movie.".

	schema:headline " Dee Snider knows how to do horror";
	schema:reviewBody "For those of you who don't know or maybe just don't remember Dee Snider was the head of the famous old school metal band Twisted Sister. Snider brought us such great anthems as We're Not Gonna Take It and I Wanna Rock. Now brings us to 1998 where Snider has began to write again. But he has shifted gear this time he is writing a movie. Dee Snider's Strangeland a movie he not only wrote but produced  and starred in as well. This is a fairly unknown movie because the NC17  rating didn't give it much help at the box office and lets admit it people SM doesn't exactly make for good clean family entertainment. But all that aside it is the story of two girls who one night meet our antagonist Captain Howdy  played here by Snider himself.  Well of course Howdy being the strange and sick person he is invite's the two girl's to a party where he later inflicts all kinds of disturbing pain and torment. Well after the girls go missing the one girls father Inspector Gage played by Kevin Gage goes on a search for his daughter. Through the help of his niece Amy Smart he tracks down Howdy and takes him into custody. Four years later Howdy is released a new man. But the towns folk want nothing to do with him and want to see him dead. Along comes Robert Englund as a redneck beer drinking slob who decides to take matters into his own hands. Wanting to see the demise of Howdy an angry mob breaks into his house and take him away. As fate would have it Gage sees the whole thing happen. Well the death of Howdy is unsuccessful and Howdy becomes his same old self again. Target 1 for Howdy seek revenge on Gage who could have stopped the whole thing but decided to just sit back and watch. So again Howdy goes after Gages daughter and Englund. What we have here is a trip through Sniders sick and twisted mind. There is something here to make just about everyone turn there head in disgust. Some may not even make it past the movie's box which features a picture of a girl with her mouth sewn shut. Definitely not for the faint of heart of the squeamish. With every good horror movie comes a good soundtrack and this is no acceptation. The soundtrack combines today's great metal acts with yesterdays classic styling. The soundtrack and movie starts with a dark and dim solo outing from Snider that sets the mood of the movie. It ends with the first new Twisted Sister song in a long time with all the original members. If you are a fan of the music or just looking for a good horror movie  a thing quite hard to come about these days this movie is for you. We ask the question does it have a cast of top notch actor? No. Will everyone enjoy it? No. Is it an entertaining ride. that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat? Yes.".

I was nervous to see this movie for a long time because I thought the acts towards women might be too brutal and frightening. I finally forced myself to watch it with a friend. I had to apologize for how lame it was. No suspense. Nothing scary. Boring. The trailer and movie cover will kick your ass. Go no further though. it is a waste of your time. maybe someday it will be a famous cult film of some the the worst famous cult films ever made. Either that or just watch it cause that 'Twisted Sister' guy is in it and you're curious.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ever since my childhood I've been fascinated by all life under water. I was only two years old had severely burned my arm and my parents didn't know how to make me forget about the pain. They decided to buy me a little fish tank with a couple of goldfish in it. And it worked as I sat on my knees in front of it I forgot about all the pain. My arm healed but the passion remained and I've always kept fishes as a pet ever since I've got two aquariums and a large pond now. I will also never miss any documentary about this wonderful creatures on television but I hadn't seen this one before. Last Christmas my mom found it on a double DVD and thought it would be a good present for me. She was right.Even though the entire documentary is situated in the water you'll get to see more than just a lot of fishes in all kinds of colors and sizes. You'll also get penguins polar bears whales dolphins... But there isn't just a diversity in the creatures that are shown. Also the environments change and that's a good thing. The polar sees are completely different from the tropical sees the Atlantic different from the Pacific and together they make sure that you keep watching it with your full interest. More than once I found myself watching it with my mouth open. All the images were incredibly beautiful but if this had been situated in one spot than the 92 minutes would have been too long. Now I just couldn't get enough of it. And that's also where this movie's main weakness if you ask me. I wished that it would keep on going on for another 30 minutes or more. It just ended too soon.If you are interested in everything that happens in that magnificent world under water but don't want to learn scuba diving first than this documentary is definitely a must see. The images are just wonderful the music that accompanies it all is great... Just let yourself be overwhelmed by the beauty and the powers of nature. It's an excellent documentary made by the BBC Natural History Unit. I give it a 1010. Just one last word of advice try to watch it on a large screen and with an excellent surround system if you can it can only add something extra to the experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Water makes up most of the Earth and unlike the surface ecosystems it is the hardest for man to explore inhabit or bulldoze. It is the closest thing to having a different planet except right here on Earth. As such I was looking forward to watching this film because of the excellent footage of the many amazing creatures and ecosystems that ever improving technology allow us to get closer to. I'm not really one for nature programmes so maybe that is why I was extra impressed by the film  because such stuff has not become ordinary to me. At the start of the film I must admit that I was watching the ordinary whales crabs and seals fitted into that category to me but once the camera went deeper into the oceans it only became more and more fascinating with such weird and wonderful creatures on display.This goes for the shallower depths as well as fish whales sharks etc are all very well presented and gorgeous to watch. Indeed that is the strength of the film  the beauty of it. It is fascinating to watch and the expertise in filming shines through from start to finish. However it is the appreciation of the view where the film is weak. Gambon's narration is sparse and even but it only occasionally gives out nuggets of information. I didn't expect detail like David Attenborough would give but it could have done with something more to compliment the visuals. The music covers the lack of narration and generally the score is well pitched to support the air of wonder or pace to the film.Overall this is a great visual treat even if it is mostly going to be seen on the small screen. It all looks impressive and is fascinating but a bit more narration and detail would have been useful. Best viewed as a visual experience or as an entry into the wider genre of nature programmes.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a very nice feeling watching a documentary like this on the big screen. You can feel the overwhelming power of waves bursting against rocky coastlines and experience the vastness of the ocean.Deep Blue takes you on a journey from the coast to the coral reefs then to the icy lands of the antarctic and finally down to the most fascinating part of this movie the deepest depths of the ocean where not a single beam of light shatters through.Most scenes are greatly composed of very clear sharp and absolutely stunning images harmonized with the orchestral music of the Berliner Philharmoniker.In one very nice and humorous scene where you see hundreds of fat penguins shambling over a sheet of ice I nearly got the impression also induced through the music watching the marching scene of Edoras citizens in Lord of the Rings The Two Towers. Might sound odd but I guess I have a faible for large scenes with many actors moving on the big screen supported by a big orchestra. There is another scene like this with little crawfish on the coast choreographed like a sports event.But in Deep Blue you have no special effects. There are literally thousands of actors in some scenes. You watch birds falling from the sky shooting into the waters grabbing one fish out of a vast swarm. You watch penguins gaining speed under water jumping out and finally more or less safely landing with their round bellies on the sheets of ice. And you're worried about little fish hiding under rocks when carnivore fishes arrive searching for food.You might have seen most of the animals before but when they take you some kilometers down you enter a completely different and very fascinating world which I have never seen before in another documentary  at least not in this clarity.Down there in this seemingly live threatening environment very very odd and sometimes scary looking creatures are lingering around. Sometimes you wonder yourself if they just dropped you out of the documentary throwing you right into a science fiction movie.There are tiny creatures partly transparent with moving light bars on their bodies pulsating in rainbow colors. There are little ones generating bright flashes to baffle their enemies. And well if you've seen Finding Nemo you might recognize the scary looking carnivore with a light bulb on his head attracting innocent little fishies.....So... I rated this documentary 810. It's not perfect in my opinion. There is a narrator sometimes throwing in some sentences which are more or less describing the current scene. I think he speaks about 1015 times in the whole movie. This goes well with the pace and the atmosphere would be disturbed by too much speaking but gives you nearly no information about the animals you see on screen. A tiny subtitle in one of the lower edges might have been great showing you the names of the creatures you're currently looking at.Also I would have done the cutting in a slightly different way. Some scenes are perfect just beautiful and overwhelming where other scenes are very much like in the usual TV documentaries.Overall this movie is worth watching in the cinema if you have the opportunity to do so. Also the more people learn to admire the wonders of the ocean the more chances mankind may have to protect it in the future.".

The moments of beauty are poignant indeed and Deep Blue has it's share of wow moments. It divides itself into various themes the shallows the shoreline the open seas the polar seas and the deep.

The penguins shooting out of the ocean like biological missiles is quite amazing and the feeding frenzy of the sharks is terrifying.

I haven't seen the documentary series Deep Blue Sea on which it was based so I cannot comment on how the film compares to that series. What I can say is for any of you who are interested in animal behavior above and below the ocean's surface you will be amazed. This film has few interruptions between wonderfully paced and edited clips of animal behavior. While I had seen almost all of the animals and plant life that appear in this movie before this gave me a new and thrilling opportunity to see their lives as the animals themselves do. You hear their voices and experience their emotions. The soundtrack kept me emotionally captivated for the entire 90 minute run time. The filmmakers don't try to narrate the behavior but let you experience it first hand to a thrilling effect.However this movie is not for the faint of heart. The filmmakers spare no detail in showing close up the threats posed to smaller sea life by larger and more voracious variations of life. With that in mind I recommend keeping young children away from this movie. The children sitting a few rows in front of me in the theater gasped and held onto their parents during the violent scenes in the film.If you do see this movie make a point to do it on the biggest screen you can find and sit as close as you can.".

	schema:reviewBody "So far we have only touched the surface ... the greatest experience of nature on screen proclaimed the leaflets advertising the documentary. Since such films on big screen in cinema are a rarity as a matter of fact not many people felt encouraged to see DEEP BLUE. Perhaps we are too much addicted to action films and all fictions possible. In this way many of us have forgotten that it is also possible to admire real nature on screen. I also must admit that I am not a fan of such documentaries. What usually bores me in them are the number of sophisticated terms provided to the viewer which makes it all too scientific. Nevertheless I went to see DEEP BLUE for the sake of images that addressed my curiosity. And I do not regret! It was wonderful throughout. The film is foremost a stunning image which pays tribute to the variety of life mostly the life under the waters.First of all it is important to mention that the documentary is not very long and serves a useful purpose not being a too detailed insight into some facts of life in the ocean. Besides the film is really visually stunning. You see the underwater world as if you were there. All kinds of fishes of various shapes and colors are a feast for the eyes. You see the entire joy and freedom of their lives as well as the necessity to defend themselves from deadly dangers. The atmosphere is great and the action is very involving. Moreover the philharmonic orchestral music in the background makes the experience even more unforgettable. The most impressive moment for me was when the journey to the deep began and the pictures we could see were fewer and fewer due to darkness. How unbelievable it is how much the sunlight provides to the earth. These creatures that have never seen the light look completely different as if not from this world. Some of them surprised me totally. Yet they also have the desire to live... There are also other wonderful moments showing life on the ground particularly the polar bear and penguins. This is filmed with great commitment indeed.DEEP BLUE is not a film for everyone. Some people may not find anything special in it. Perhaps that is why the cinemas in Poland had it for only 10 up to 15 days while other films are being showed for two months or even longer. Yet I would recommend DEEP BLUE to anyone who can still admire the variety of beauties on the planet of life that the earth not unintentionally is. But remember to see it on the big screen. The film is foremost an experience of image!".

It wasn't just some footage from Jaws 4 and an Australianvoiced cartoon character making shark jokes. It was a very well done film and it was narrated by Pierce Brosnan of James Bond fame.

	schema:reviewBody "The beginning of this documentary is devoid of credits. We see dolphins swimming and leaping in the open water and sea birds diving directly into the ocean to snatch a fish. The narrator Pierce Brosnan says This is a world of constant jeopardy an endless cycle of birth death and renewal. Powerful waves crash into the rocky coast where the sea lions return to give birth but unwary seals become prey to predators the black and white colored killer whales in the shallows at high tide. Then again the whales themselves risk being stranded there.More marine life is seen before the view shifts to the coral reefs a narrow band of sunfed life only found in the shallows of the tropical seas. The skeletons of coral polyps  the smallest and most fragile of organisms  form the reef. The darkness is feeding time for some the nightfeeders with builtin sensors have no need of light. Fascinating and colorful sea creatures abound further below the ocean surface but unfortunately most are not identified. There are poisonous jellyfish and manta rays. Just before the halfway mark of the film the scene moves to the Arctic polar bears and also Antarctic penguins. In the Antarctic the temperature is seventy degrees below zero 70F and the winds exceed one hundred miles per hour. The penguins gather speed in the cold waters before jumping out and landing on sheet ice. Meanwhile in the far north the polar bears search for nesting seals hidden in ice caves situated just below the surface. Thirtyton gray whales travel six thousand miles to feed in the polar seas. After six hours of jostling killer whales separate one unfortunate gray calf from its mother and move in when it is thoroughly exhausted. From the surface of the ocean we next enter a subterranean world the deepest underwater area on the planet and where surface light does not penetrate. Seven miles deep the Marianas Trench it is a mystery world of perpetual night. It is a sparsely explored netherworld of odd life forms again unidentified. The only light emanates from the undersea creatures themselves. Light is used as a lure to attract prey or as a decoy to confuse them. Poisonous hydrogen sulfide gas and boiling water spew forth in some areas. Yet even near those settings some life forms exist. At film's end we hear that there are only a few thousand blue whales left on earth. The blue whales are earth's largest creatures by far.The narration is limited and the orchestral music appropriate. If you like nature documentaries you will enjoy this one although there are several lulls.".

I have no idea of how the crew could have gotten some of these startlingly revealing shots. How for instance do you get close enough to a polar bear to film its attempt to catch a beluga whale without disturbing the bear itself? I mean the bear can't be blind! Telephoto lenses yes but these images are crisp and clear as if shot from ten feet away.It's less academic than it is an aesthetic experience. No scientific names. Pierce Brosnan's sparse narration keeps us abreast of what we're watching and what's going on. That pile of big pebbles is actually a group of emperor penguins huddled together for warmth against the antarctic blizzard. You wouldn't know it without the narration except that every once in a while a penguin's head pops up out of the gray pile and glances around for a few seconds.The musical score is as lyrical and majestic as the visual imagery which may be good or not so good but it never becomes cloying. It resembles Debussy as impressionist all about nature and movement. If this had appeared in say 1968 the weed heads would have flocked to it. But these days they're all grown up and don't need to alter their state of consciousness to appreciate what they're witnessing. The film itself will take care of that.It's in no way a treehugger movie. Well Brosnan's narration ends with a question. Are we in the process of destroying this before we've come to understand it? It's a legitimate and completely nonpolitical query.".

As some others have said much of this footage has been seen before so i really didn't see the point of this movie. The musical score was good and it did match the footage well. If sea life is your thing I would recommend the Blue Planet. Note of interest did anybody else actually find some of the footage very poor. I watched on a widescreen LCD brand new so perhaps the poor quality arose because of the screen size.".

The water is unbelievably blue as we see dolphins leap out of the ocean in slow motion . Sorry to break this to people but dolphins can and do jump out of the water  but only in real time and never in slo mo . We see a massed army of crabs running around the sands and through some clever editing and sound effects it appears they're having a game of soccer . The music used matches the mood perfectly graceful music is used for graceful animals like dolphins  menacing music is used for sharks and humorous music is used for the penguins You see the point I'm making ? It's a manipulative beautiful documentary featuring animals that the film makers have humanised and will appeal to the more urbane and abstract nature loves amongst the human race . If I sound cynical perhaps it's because the day after I saw this I took a dip in the Atlantic Ocean where I had to dodge aggressive jellyfish and hungry gulls who were very interested in my picnic .

The movie generates awe and wonder not intellectual understanding.The film is bursting with creatures I have never seen before so fantastic and strange at times I felt I must be watching the creations of some mad 3D animator on LSD or Fellini's ghost.You want to see this on the big screen.My only complaint is about the Foley artist Brian Moseley whose natural sound effects are positively silly obviously not the actual sounds of the creatures or the ocean. Thankfully the original score played by the Berlin Philharmonic covers up most of those ridiculous Star Trek swooshes and gurgling toilets.Only in retrospect do you wonder about how the cameramen created so many impossible shots.

	schema:reviewBody "I've always found the study of hydrospace fascinating. Consider the blood of icefish which inhabit Antarctica said to contain nature's own antifreeze allowing them to survive in this otherwise inhospitable region. Or fish with pectoral appendages which allow them to fly up out of the water for up to forty seconds or the mudskipper fish that can walk and even climb. Scientific man is obsessed with the stars but not near enough with starfish and the myriad of other creatures great and microscopic which exist in the depths and that in total outnumber the stars in the cosmos.There is much more water than there is land on Earth. Our planet is so much deeper than those who believe it only to be green. DEEP BLUE acknowledges this fact and celebrates it. Here the blue dot seen from the heavens is magnified to such a wondrous extent. Into the watery abyss we go where an extraordinary menagerie of critters reside all obliviously going about their business much like we do on dry earth.Sting rays. Swordfish. Sea turtles. Sea lions. Eels. Jellyfish. Sharks. They all make an appearance. As well as cryptozoic beings inhabiting the coral reefs strangely amorphous and tentacled and some emitting colorful bioluminescence. Even near the very bottom of the ocean there exists light on account of these latter creatures.I've seen many nature films and documentaries over the years but none quite match this one. DEEP BLUE is an exceptionally photographed film containing spectacular cinematography. The voiceover narration is minimal. We watch not so much to be educated as enthralled. There's one particular underwater sequence that is so impressive indescribably ethereal and indelible. It lasts for about three minutes and begins at approximately 1 hour and 8 minutes into the movie. This in my opinion is the highlight of the film and is what sets DEEP BLUE apart from all the rest of its kind.Naturally two of my favorite animals are in this those joyful and playful swimmers  the dolphins and those adorable waddling seabirds the penguins. I can do without sand crabs and piranhas but that's just me. To each his own.Who after seeing this can forget all the images of various predators pursuing and attacking their prey as in the slowmotion imagery of a whale nearing the shore tossing around a semiaquatic bird flipping it over like a slab of meat on a grill. If there's anything to be taken away from watching DEEP BLUE it's that the oceanic realms are certainly carnivorous. Personally it had me thinking of fish  chips.I'm no snorkeler or scuba diver so I thank the explorative filmmakers for bringing hydrospace up close and personal to me as possible without my getting soaked. Incidentally I watched closely and failed to spot either a USO or a mermaid. Shy perhaps.".

Emperor penguins have gone without food in order to protect their eggs for three months on the ice of 50 points below zero. It is not only very beautiful but also sad that shakes and dolphins and sea birds fight in water with aiming the school of sardines.The story into the sea is the drama without plot but for lives in the water life and death are to their side. So it's not game it's serious. They live desperately so I was much moved. There are cruel scenes for example the hunting of a killer whale but it is reality. However it is interesting in inexperienced world and we can feel so wonderful as if you took a trip to all over the sea. You will meet various lives and experience something priceless in this trip.

The unfortunate problem with this movie is that it had litterely nothing that I hadn't seen at some time on the discover channel or the national geographic channel or animal planet etc. Thus it was very hard to stay interested in it for over two hours.

	schema:reviewBody "We went to see this on the understanding that it was an aquatic equivalent to 'Winged Migration' but we were left sorely disappointed on a number of levels. The score was horrible completely over the top and intrusive. The narration was misjudged. Whereas 'Winged Migration' had minimalist narration and you were left to just drink in the images 'Deep Blue' had enough to interrupt your concentration on the images but not enough to be genuinely informative. Quite often you found yourself waiting for a scene to be explained that never was and the rest of the time you were just wanting it to be quiet. And because of the nature of the footage some scenes had to be explained  a scuffle between a killer whale and a seal in the surf may have been dramatic but without a voiceover telling you what was happening it was just so much water being thrashed about. And as with the score in places the narration was overly dramatic as if the writers didn't think the footage exciting enough on it's own.By far the biggest disappointment though was the footage itself. Wonderfully shot and truly breathtaking and fascinating at times granted.But whereas 'Winged Migration' was shot as a movie  it was brand new footage that had been shot with that project in mind  'Deep Blue' is a compilation of BBC clips. So much of the footage had been seen before  how many times has that footage of the killer whale hunting seals on the beach been used for example. And when we saw the movie the footage of the dolphins seals sharks and birds hunting the huge shoals of sardines that bookended the movie had been on television only the week before. Film like that should always be breathtaking naturally but there does come a point when you have seen a certain clip a number of times that it loses it's magic. Ultimately whereas 'Winged Migration' was spellbinding 'Deep Blue' was a pleasant hour and a half that was occasionally ruined by it's poor music and narration.".

Of course he walked off the job a year or so earlier fearing that his creation might be used as a weapon.  He was right.  It's the potential for that disaster thing I just mentioned which brings our wouldbe hero back to save the day.  If this sounds remotely like so many other films out there it probably is.This is B movie territory folks but it's a FUN ride!  Sheffer gets to dig down 120 miles into the Earth and place 5 nuclear bombs that will create a chain effect that stops the planet from tearing itself apart...while also saving valuable budget money by not showing too many disasters on the surface always visible because the camera shakes before we get some cheesy CGI effects.Along for the ride is James Russo Wil Wheaton giving a better performance than in Python and Terry Farrell Dax from Star Trek Deep Space 9. What the film isn't able to entertain you with visually because of what I'm assuming is a modest budget it more than makes up for in dialogue and acting.  There are a few technobabble bits here and there but these guys and gal are enjoying themselves and provide some welcome laughter.  Forget the other Government stiffs.  They kind of pad the film a bit and aren't nearly as fun to watch.It's especially nice to see Sheffer in a more heroic role after Hellraiser Inferno and Wheaton still has a smile that will make you melt.  If you can overlook some really fake CGI effects and just take the movie for what it's supposed to be entertainment then you could do a lot worse than give Deep Core a try.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chant ten thousand geeks as Wesley Crusher appears on screen.  Does he die? Frankly who cares.  With no characterisation a plot that could be and probably was written on the back of a cigarette packet mediocre actors a sloppy score Amateur Hour CGI and fair to middling awful camera work it's hard to pay attention to anything happening in this B movie.Guys here's a hint.  When the crew turns up with Hi8 camcorders it's time to call your agent and see if there's any commercials going or small car showrooms that need opened.  This film does nobody any favours.  It's pretty much welfare for C list jobbing actors and crew.

With no characterisation a plot that could be and probably was written on the back of a cigarette packet mediocre actors a sloppy score Amateur Hour CGI and fair to middling awful camera work it's hard to pay attention to anything happening in this B movie.Guys here's a hint.  When the crew turns up with Hi8 camcorders it's time to call your agent and see if there's any commercials going or small car showrooms that need opened.  This film does nobody any favours.  It's pretty much welfare for C list jobbing actors and crew.

And I've never even taken a geology course. Or the other plot option is that they are merely exploring the center of the earth find lost civilizations monsters etc.Quickly here's a list of all the films and a brief comparison to this one The Core The Gold Standard. Much higher budget than this one and a fun Bmovie that doesn't take itself nearly as seriously as this one.Journey To The Center of the Earth I liked this even though it had Pat Boone in it. A good old fashioned fantasy film from back in the day.Mesa of Lost Women See my review here on the IMDb. One of the worst movies ever made.The Phantom Empire Fred Olen Ray directed mishmash of a ripoff of Indiana Jones a 1950's alien invasion movie and a 1930's serial. A lovable jumble of insanity. They spend most of the movie running around in the cave in Bronson Canyon a legendary Bmovie location in Los Angeles. Super fun for Bmovie fans. Others might get annoyed.Unknown World Another machinethingy must drill into the Earth to save civilization. Actually pretty well done for a nobudget film from 1952. Black and white of course.Beast From Haunted Cave Okay they didn't go down into the Earth that far only into a cave. But they find a cool monster in there. Enjoyable Roger Corman produced schlockery.The Incredible Petrified World  Also 1950's black and white. They find a secret underground world here comes the twist under the ocean floor! They descend in a diving bell. Zero budget here. Incredibly boring. Only saving grace is John Carradine but he can only do so much. Rating real low. Skip it.Village of the Giants  I think there's a cave in this one? Is that why I stuck it in here?Sound of Horror  Haven't watched this one yet but I believe it's about people dying in a cave in Greece.At The Earth's Core  Classic 1970's schlock! Based on Edgar Rice Burroughs. Classic Saturday afternoon fun fare. Worth watching.The Lost Continent  People enter the Earth and find lost world of dinosaurs...so bad it's good. Some hilarious moments. Another black and white low budget nonepic from the 1950's.I need to pick up The Cave and The Descent two recent films with people dying undernearth the earth.DEEP CORE stacks up pretty well against some of these. There is a ton of hilariously bad dialog and the interior of the Drilling Thingy is really bad and low rent.I'll give it a four for good old yocks. If DEEP CORE had taken itself a little less seriously it probably would have rated a 6 or 7 for entertainment value. The Core is much funnier. Stanley Tucci's performance alone makes it worth your time.".

	schema:headline " As seen on Telefutura Deep Core has shallow reach of talent  innovation";
	schema:reviewBody "I've now watched enough movies on TV  in Spanish to set the bar low for expectations. Films as bad as Deep Core prompt me to do other activities like play the Wii on another TV made almostuseless by the digital transition a few years ago.  when I do focus on the movie I make some comments or riffs about how crappy the scene is. Deep Core is another silly scifi film about how some scientists use a very ginormous machine  possibly worth a trillion tax dollars if it's a government asset  that's equipped w the requisite nuclear bombs  one rogue scientist to complicate the mission which is to prevent some cataclysmic catastrophe that could kill millions as evidenced by either stock footage of past disasters or modestlooking CGI demonstrating destructions of world landmarks e.g. California's Pacific Coast Highway or some church in Quito Ecuador. This also stars two thespians from a Star Trek spin off Wil Wheaton from The Next Generation  some actress from Deep Space Nine. I have to say that now that I enjoy Wheaton as Sheldon's nemesisturnedpal on The Big Bang Theory that silly scene of him taking a deadly magma shower in this movie is forgiven.  I assume Deep Core had a midrange budget as all the exterior shots of the drilling vehicle were done on a computer while the interior shots look like something in a sketch comedy show. I think if I actually bothered to watch  understand the Spanish dubbing to learn the story perhaps I'd hear some jokes or double entendres about drilling. But I doubt such comedy would be in the movie. In conclusion Deep Core judging by my 2 outta 10 rating isn't crappy enough to scare you into turning off the TV. But the dialogue  plot  the scenes wo CGI graphics  is so unintriguing that it's recommended to do a little multitasking such as eating websurfing or if your TV has PIP watching something better on the other screen.".

	onyx:emotionText "I've now watched enough movies on TV  in Spanish to set the bar low for expectations. Films as bad as Deep Core prompt me to do other activities like play the Wii on another TV made almostuseless by the digital transition a few years ago.  when I do focus on the movie I make some comments or riffs about how crappy the scene is. Deep Core is another silly scifi film about how some scientists use a very ginormous machine  possibly worth a trillion tax dollars if it's a government asset  that's equipped w the requisite nuclear bombs  one rogue scientist to complicate the mission which is to prevent some cataclysmic catastrophe that could kill millions as evidenced by either stock footage of past disasters or modestlooking CGI demonstrating destructions of world landmarks e.g. California's Pacific Coast Highway or some church in Quito Ecuador. This also stars two thespians from a Star Trek spin off Wil Wheaton from The Next Generation  some actress from Deep Space Nine. I have to say that now that I enjoy Wheaton as Sheldon's nemesisturnedpal on The Big Bang Theory that silly scene of him taking a deadly magma shower in this movie is forgiven.

I think Bruce Mcgill was awesome CUTE and funny in the film as well. I like all of Bruce's work that I've seen so far especially as Daniel Simpson DDay Day in Animal House and Jack Dalton in MacGyver. He was so cute in these two. Terry Wil and all the others did a great job. I thought it was very sad to kill Wil off not only because he was the youngest but because he was so cute too. This is also a very hard movie to find in my location but this movie is one of my favorite movies from 2000 to 2001. Hope to see another great movie like this one soon and wouldn't hurt my feelings to see the same people especially Bruce or Wil in one either.".

For the last fifteen years I've owned a VHS tape of it recorded from a laserdisc version and seen it loads of times. Today I got the Region 2 Widescreen DVD and I was once again confirmed in my opinion that this is a fine movie. It is underwater scifi horror and one of several such movies from the era but except that it doesn't have the clout effects wizardry and budget of a James Cameron attached to it it manages to be an extremely wellcrafted production none the less.The actors are great. Every one of them have absolutely unique and realistic character traits and the dynamism between the crew is superbly entertaining. Nancy Everhard as a softspoken female navy seal is played with humble sincerity and feminine sensitivity making for a very realistic package. Nia Peeples is the sexiest thing you ever saw and the one whose intuition foresees the whole thing. Miguel Ferrer is even more obnoxious here than in Twin Peaks yet also profoundly pitiable. Everybody gives an amazingly human and believable performance and the action and production values are overall perfectly adequate and effective succeeding entirely in suspending the viewer's disbelief.To the day I die I will maintain that this is a good movie.

This DeepStar Six is a semisuccessful underseamonster mash with surprisingly good acting decent special effects and a couple of good oldfashioned scary moments. The film deserves a reasonable rating slightly higher than all other lame and laughable Ridley Scott and James Cameron wannabes. The plot involves an 11headed crew that is about to finish up a 6month research at the bottom of the ocean. When exploring the ocean floor they accidentally stumble upon a hideous and relentless monster. Like it usually is the case in this type of films it takes a little while before you actually get to see the monster. By that time human stupidity already exterminated half of the cast. Granted the monster itself is one ugly critter and not at all badly put together by the special effects department. Butlet's not praise this film too much because it simply remains a rather anonymous 80's monster movie like we've seen them so many times before already. Not one action presented here isn't inspired by or similar to the ones featuring in other films and every character is a flawless stereotype. The performances given by the entire cast actually outshine the roles they're playing. Highlight of them all is Miguel Ferrer who portrays the typical cowardly crewmember. Constantly complaining and arguing at first and when the monster shows uphe flees to and leaves his colleagues to their own device. Every monster flick stars a bastard like that you know. As well as the superintelligent and overambitious female scientist and the heroic captain who sacrifices himself in order to save his crew. If you ignore these inevitable weaknesses you'll certainly have fun. You get what you expect and that doesn't necessarily have to sound like a bad comment.".

Miguel Ferrer clearly gives the best performance in this film with his excellent slimy portrayal of Snyder the everpickedupon handyman eager to get topside. I thought Nia Peeples and Nancy Everhard should have changed roles because Everhard's character was a toughasnails Navy officer and Nancy although she clearly got into solid shape for the role looks more like a schoolmarm than a soldierPeeples on the other hand has the hard body for a female Navy officer but her line readings were way too fast. I felt like whenever Nia had a line I had accidentally hit the fast forward button. The other actors were fine. Evigan is okay as the male lead and Matt McCoy does a solid job as the goofoff. Ferris Bueller's mom Cindy Pickett gives a solid performance as the base's medical officer and Marius Weyers is great as always. His character really needed to be more developed though.NUDITY None but no female cast member wears a bra in this movie.

The first is that the acting although from a far less stellar cast than Leviathan or The Abyss sported is really quite good. Director Cunningham uses the first hour to good effect in building the characters and when they are allowed to breathe life into their stereotypical characters they do a decent job of making us care about them. The cast is made up of former TV stars and minor actors who have cropped up in an odd horror or scifi film.The most notable actor probably is Miguel Ferrer who plays his normal screwup guy. He keeps screwing up over and over again not only does he cause the station to suffer catastrophe but he's also responsible for a number of other horrendous mishaps during the running time which inflict more suffering upon not only himself but the rest of the crew. Ferrer must go down as the 'World's Worst Crewmate to 'Have During a Disaster'. He is brilliant as he begins to lose his marbles and one of the best characters in this flick . Ferrer's departure is probably the highlight of the film. He goes out like a champ .When I watch a film like DeepStar Six  I want to see a big monster eat people ! The real strength of the film lies in the monster. He's a big bold mongrel of a special effect and if I ignore the quibble about continuity he seems to shrink as the film goes on as required I have to say that he really knocks the sea water out of the other watery beasts. Basically he's a big worm with lots and lots of teeth and a fairly insatiable appetite. This is clearly a good thing in creature feature.Three major underwater movies came out in 1989 Laviathan Deepstar Six and The Abyss . Overall this is a good fun film.

On a routine job two of the crew members on the small submarine blasted the cave open. They decided to explore it but they encounter the unknown. When a large mysterious creature attacked the underwater ship and killed the two crew members instantly. Since this creature is attractive to light this thing decides to attack the crew of the ocean floor station.Directed by B movie producerSean S. Cunningham Friday the 13th Spring Break made an entertaining lowbudget adventure with some cheap thrills. The cast do their best with this material but it is Ferrer gives the only memorable performance in this cheap feature. Some people prefer this one over Leviathan but I think Leviathan is better made much superior cast and special effects are superior to DeepStar Six. The look of the creature is not bad the best thing in Cunningham's direction. He only used the creature in some key sequences and the monster only appears in the movie for a couple of minutes.DeepStar Six should have had an large budget what i felt hurts the movie are the underwater sequences are not very convincing. It seems to me that Cunningham worked hard on a low budget and he did his best to cover the flawed production values. It seems that Mario Kassar and Andrew Vanja from Carolco Pictures only give Cunningham an 10 million budget or less. I felt the script was good and Harry Manfredini Best known for Friday the 13th movies gives an good music score probably his best work. I felt the cast seemed out of place expect for Ferrer but they did their best.I would love to watch this movie in Widescreen since the region 1 DVD's are only Full Screen. Maybe in a future Bluray release we can finally watch it in the original Widescreen aspect ratio of 2.351.This is a update from March 25 2013. I track down the Region 2 DVD from eBay. DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen 2.351 transfer and Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound is quite good. DVD also includes an rather dull commentary track by the filmmakers two featurette original theatrical trailer and photo gallery.As a B movie it works but fails as a A level production. Since Carolco Pictures are better known for their big budget productions. As a Guilty Pleasure DeepStar Six is entertaining. It is memorable for Miguel Ferrer's standout supporting performance and an surprisingly good Harry Manfredini score. Certainly an interesting double feature with Leviathan for one night's viewing. Super 35.  .".

He only used the creature in some key sequences and the monster only appears in the movie for a couple of minutes.DeepStar Six should have had an large budget what i felt hurts the movie are the underwater sequences are not very convincing. It seems to me that Cunningham worked hard on a low budget and he did his best to cover the flawed production values. It seems that Mario Kassar and Andrew Vanja from Carolco Pictures only give Cunningham an 10 million budget or less. I felt the script was good and Harry Manfredini Best known for Friday the 13th movies gives an good music score probably his best work. I felt the cast seemed out of place expect for Ferrer but they did their best.I would love to watch this movie in Widescreen since the region 1 DVD's are only Full Screen. Maybe in a future Bluray release we can finally watch it in the original Widescreen aspect ratio of 2.351.This is a update from March 25 2013. I track down the Region 2 DVD from eBay. DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen 2.351 transfer and Dolby 2.0 Surround Sound is quite good. DVD also includes an rather dull commentary track by the filmmakers two featurette original theatrical trailer and photo gallery.As a B movie it works but fails as a A level production. Since Carolco Pictures are better known for their big budget productions. As a Guilty Pleasure DeepStar Six is entertaining. It is memorable for Miguel Ferrer's standout supporting performance and an surprisingly good Harry Manfredini score. Certainly an interesting double feature with Leviathan for one night's viewing. Super 35.  .";

S Cunningham Friday the 13th which came out the same time as the overblown but dull 'The Abyss' and for me the best of the three 'Leviathan'.Fairly routine stuff but still it has it's moments of sheer excitement. The setting of the film is good from the set details of the 'DeepStar six' laboratory base where most of the action occurs too the alienation of the calm ocean floor.The characters are your stereotypical types but the performances are welldelivered with Miguel Ferrer as the very edgy and hysterical Snyder who steals the show and Matt McCoy as the wise cracking Richardson adds some life too. The script had its tedious spots of state the bloody obvious comments but it's mostly bearable with some added wit provided by McCoy's character.The direction by Cunningham is solid with some nice touches of suspense created and not forgetting a couple of gory moments that truly standout. While the plot is reasonable it still follows your usual monster on the loose formula though the idea of the creature's origin was interesting but it definitely could have been explored in to more. Though other than a seamonster causing trouble for the underwater crew they also face human foolishness and a leaking laboratory base with some of the crew falling victims to themselves than the monster.The pace can be slow at times though that does help add tension and it definitely picks up in the last 40mins when the monster actually fully appears. While the special effects and the monster itself is fair and it does look a bit like the monsters from 'Tremors' and add a bit of crab too but it does look more ridiculous and very rubbery when the whole design appears on screen I was hoping that they would keep it mostly hidden e.g. 'Jaws' but overall it's not too distracting.Well have I gone soft as this discreet seamonster film has definitely improved on my second viewing?".

	schema:reviewBody "When John Carpenter makes a low budget scifi thriller it becomes cult when Sean S. Cunningham does the same practically everyone calls it cheap. I don't get it. Okay DeepStar Six is a little dull but once the monster pops up it isn't that bad. Visually I think it's fine and although the special effects look slightly premature and clearly a lot of smallscale models have been used I actually prefer this over the clinical and steely looking computer tricks pulled by canonized Industrial Light and Magic.To compare this film to Fantastic Voyage 1966 may be way out of line but still DeepStar Six reminded me of that somewhat ridiculous film in which a scientific crew and their vehicle are shrunk in order to explore the human body. Little human bodies are saved in DeepStar Six and that is a bit of a waste since the cast is good and especially the female contributions by Nia Peeples Nancy Everhard and Cindy Pickett are swell. Greg Evigan makes a nice lead and he has the right looks for his heroic part. Thank God or Cunningham they did not cast a bull like Steven Segal or Chuck Norris for this part for that would have spoiled everything. A pleasant surprise is the presence of Marius Weyers who played in the wonderful classic The Gods Must Be Crazy. Not at his best here but I don't mind. Camera and lighting are done in such a way that the interior of the ship as well as the atmosphere look pretty authentic and Sean S. Cunningham has done a fine job in making his actors move around in it naturally and convincingly. Not a masterpiece but I am pleased to see a film like this from a man who has done much worse.".

Okay DeepStar Six is a little dull but once the monster pops up it isn't that bad. Visually I think it's fine and although the special effects look slightly premature and clearly a lot of smallscale models have been used I actually prefer this over the clinical and steely looking computer tricks pulled by canonized Industrial Light and Magic.To compare this film to Fantastic Voyage 1966 may be way out of line but still DeepStar Six reminded me of that somewhat ridiculous film in which a scientific crew and their vehicle are shrunk in order to explore the human body. Little human bodies are saved in DeepStar Six and that is a bit of a waste since the cast is good and especially the female contributions by Nia Peeples Nancy Everhard and Cindy Pickett are swell. Greg Evigan makes a nice lead and he has the right looks for his heroic part. Thank God or Cunningham they did not cast a bull like Steven Segal or Chuck Norris for this part for that would have spoiled everything. A pleasant surprise is the presence of Marius Weyers who played in the wonderful classic The Gods Must Be Crazy. Not at his best here but I don't mind. Camera and lighting are done in such a way that the interior of the ship as well as the atmosphere look pretty authentic and Sean S. Cunningham has done a fine job in making his actors move around in it naturally and convincingly. Not a masterpiece but I am pleased to see a film like this from a man who has done much worse.";

	schema:reviewBody "Despite a very solid cast and some fairly good production values DeepStar Six sinks under the weight of it own inertia. This is an extremely uneventful film and though ostensibly a monster movie there is almost no monster action whatsoever until the final twenty minutes or so and even then what we get is extremely lackluster thanks to some very poor special effects. The script presumably aims to build tension gradually and spends a lot of time focusing on the ensemble cast with a little extra emphasis on our heroine played by Nancy Everhard but while this may sound like a good idea in theory in practice it fails utterly as even a characterdriven story needs a certain amount of drama and tension which DeepStar Six totally lacks. As a result I zoned out at numerous points in the tedious plot line and found myself strongly considering the stop button more than once...but I persevered in the vain hope that at some point a monster would rear itself from the mysterious depths and serious havoc would ensue. Never happened as even when the sea monster that is our villain finally awkwardly asserts itself the resultant action is poorly executed and the creature effects are inferior to similar designs from the 1950s. Some quality performances from a respectable cast that tries hard are unfortunately wasted and while the aforementioned Everhard does a good job as our likable but underdeveloped heroine the best performance probably comes from Miguel Ferrer as a burnout victim whose sanity is slowly slipping away from him after six months of arduous underwater duty. It wouldn't have taken a whole lot for DeepStar Six to have been a solid bmovie or maybe even a little more than that if only the script and direction had made action a higher priority and perhaps developed a couple of the key characters a bit better. But as it stands DeepStar Six is simply monotonous and underwhelming in the extreme.".

The play is a retelling of a period in the French Revolution culminating with the assassination exactly fifteen years earlier of revolutionary JeanPaul Marat by peasant girl Charlotte Corday.

	schema:reviewBody "The film is essentially a filmed record of the live theatre production by the Royal Shakespeare Co. that toured to New York in the late 1960's and was filmed for Art House distribution by Universal.This is one of my alltime favorite films because of the sheer density of meaning in it.  The story is set in an asylum in 1808 in the Napoleonic era and the play within it is set in 1793 during the most violent part of the French Revolutionary era.  Most of the dialogue has relevance to political criticism in both eras.  If that were not enough it also has levels that are clearly evoking the era that the playwright Weiss was writing in the 1960's and also Germany's recent HolocaustWWII past.  Some passages in the play most notably those relating to war manage to have a level of meaning for ALL FOUR eras at once!  Because I show this film to classes I've seen it dozens of times and I'm continually intrigued by it because each viewing reveals new meanings as it seems to weirdly comment on the current day's events that occurred long after it was written and filmed.  The first viewing is often disorienting because it piles so much historicsociosexualpolitical content up with so much odd directing and extreme acting style that it is hard to grasp at first but repeated viewings suck you in like an intellectual's Rocky Horror Picture Show and some theatre junkies learn to sing along.The Film of the Royal Shakespeare Company production of MaratSade 1967 is considered a classic avant garde 1960's drama in the style known as Theatre of Cruelty. It is often shown to university level theatre classes because it has wonderful examples of both Artaud and Brecht theatre styles in it.  I show it to my classes and it never fails to blow their undergraduate minds.  It stars Glenda Jackson as Charlotte Corday now Dame Glenda Jackson MP Ian Richardson of House of Cards fame as Marat and Patrick Magee Clockwork Orange as de Sade.As the title implies the film is entirely a playwithinaplay where most cast members depict both a character from the French Revolution as well as an insane asylum inmate playing that character. While the film like the later comedydrama about deSade Quills addresses censorship it is primarily concerned with a debate between Marat as a sort of representative of revolutionary radical communism and de Sade as a nihilistic existentialist frustrated with his own and society's violently cruel urges as well as the futility of revolutionary action to improve mankind.Despite this very heavy and multilayered topic the film also manages to be both sexy and funny in regular intervals. Great moments include a comic orgy scene where the inmates sing What's the point of a revolution without general copulation? in a round like rowrowrow your boat and mime a vigorously improbable group sex event fully clothed Magee's various speeches on the nature of man What we do is but a shadow of what we want to do...  Richardson's unblinking intensity as he waits for the knife to kill him and Jackson doing a little dance trying to capture the knife from de Sade while he teases her with it in an effort to get her in his arms. Add to this the delightful theatricality and musical numbers yes there are many musical numbers! and it is little wonder that the play on which the film is based has regularly been performed all around the world ever since it was written.".

The multilayered ideas come thick and fast I had to watch the movie over two nights because there's so much to think about and some of the words and images are so overwhelming.Of the Royal Shakespeare Company actors in the film little known at the time Glenda Jackson had the most notable subsequent career but Ian Richardson Marat has also done remarkable things and he's so young here you may not recognize him.This is not a movie for casual entertainment but if you care about history and the deepest questions of good and evil and free will you'll find much of value here.";

The interplay of several levels of perception is fascinating and the overall effect is definitely one of a real insane asylum disturbingly so at times. There is much humour here as well again on multiple levels... this is definitely an intellectual movie a thinking man's movie... all action takes place in the single bathouse of the asylum.

So I took advantage of it and rented the movie. And this is what I found within it...Never before has a title been so self explanatory. It serves as the film's plot description. It is basically a filmed play about the French Revolution and the last days of JeanPaul Marat Ian Richardson. The catch is It is performed by patients of a mental hospital in France in 1808. And it is directed and acted in by a famous patient at the hospital The Marquis de Sade. It is performed to the Administrator and his family and many local citizens who care to watch. The point of the show is to prove that the hospital's rehabilitation methods are working but de Sade has a far more ambitious goal than that. And the play is constantly interrupted by the administrator who feels it should be more politically correct for the recent times. But after the second act the inmates have secretly taken over and he is forced just to watch in horror as are we...the audience.It is very hard to classify this film. At some points it is a drama. At other points it is a thriller mystery horror comedy and even musical the musical numbers are very strange. But for the most part it is a two hour history lesson. All the performances are excellent and haunting especially Glenda Jackson's performance. The film has a bizarre tone about it and is easily the most eerie film I have ever scene. When I called it a history lesson you might have lost interest right then. But all the actors especially the narrator who speaks only in rhymes looks directly into the camera as they speak.

Ultimately and although it makes effective use of its setting and the cinematography mirrors the chaos expected of such a situation the film version of MARATSADE is less a motion picture than a record of a justly famous stage play that offers a complex statement re man's savagery.The story of MARATSADE concerns the performance of a play by inmates of an early 1800s insane asylum with script and direction by the infamous Marquis de Sade. While this may sound a bit farfetched it is based on fact de Sade was known to have written plays for performance by inmates during his own incarceration in an asylum. The story of the play concerns the assassination of the revolutionary Marat by Charotte Corday but the play itself becomes a debate between various characters all of which may be read as in some way intrinsically destructive and evil. Since all the characters are played by mentallyill inmates of the asylum the actor playing Marat for example is described as a paranoid and the actress playing Corday suffers from sleeping sickness and melancholia the debate is further fueled by their insanity unpredictability as performers and the staff's reactions to both their behavior and the often subversive nature of the script they play out.Patrick Magee as de Sade Glenda Jackson as the inmate playing Corday it was her breakout performance and Ian Richardson as the inmate playing Marat offering impressive performances indeed the ensemble cast as a whole is incredibly impressive and they keep the extremely wordy script moving along with considerable interest. Even so it will be obvious that the material works better as a live performance than as a film and I do not recommend it to a casual viewer its appeal will be largely limited to the literary and theatrical intelligentsia.

To commemorate the anniversary and to show off the hospital's own special brand of art therapy a group of inmates at Charenton Asylum perform a play recreating Marat's last days written and directed by the infamous Marquis de Sade. The players include a recovering paranoiac a narcoleptic also suffering from melancholia a sex maniac a former priest a former prostitute and a patient so incensed by his role that he is confined to a straightjacket the entire time. As the play progresses delving into the political and social unrest of the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror the players discuss and debate the purpose of revolution the horrors of war the futility of activism the need for equality the impossibility of equality the desire for freedom the importance of individuality and the relationship between murder and sexual passion. To start with.Oh and it's a musical too.This is a great movie. One of the most intellectually challenging and rewarding movies I've ever seen. Directed by Peter Brook and performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company it's a filmed version of Peter Weiss' play of the same name. It demands a lot of a viewer. Once it starts it doesn't give you much room to breathe. It just takes off running and you are forced to keep up with it. It's one of the few movies I've ever seen where I was agreeing and disagreeing with every main character at various points. It's almost too much to take in in one sitting. I've seen it several times and I still feel like there's more to get out of it. I knew next to nothing about the French Revolution going in but I still felt like I understood the issues at hand. They can just as easily apply to modern American society.The acting is uniformly excellent. The three main playersPatrick Magee de Sade Ian Richardson Marat and Glenda Jackson Cordayare all outstanding. Magee brings a unique humanity to a man largely considered by history to be a savage pervert. Richardson's Marat is heartbreaking. Endlessly staring ahead he knows his cause is probably lost but can't give up on it. Jackson is stunning as both the impassioned Corday and the patient desperately trying to spit out her lines before she falls asleep again. There isn't a note out of place in the whole cast. What I can't get over is that these actors had already performed these roles on stage umpteen times before they made the film. That they performed such a challenging play night after night with the same kind of talent intensity and passion you see on the screen is remarkable.MaratSade is definitely a polarizing film. I wasn't sure I liked it until the second time I watched it. But I couldn't stop thinking about it after the first. It's disturbing frightening funny and demanding sometimes all at the same time but in my opinion it's worth seeing at least once.".

	schema:reviewBody "MaratSade is quite simply one of the best movies I have ever seen. The movie asks the eternal questions regarding the nature of being and the definitions that are agreed to and imposed by society in all of its forms. Everything is described in this movie including censorship and propaganda which are all delivered under the guise of benevolent tyranny. The fact that a good portion of events described in the movie aren't historically accurate doesn't mar the precise and razor sharp script an English translation of a German Play.

The movie asks the eternal questions regarding the nature of being and the definitions that are agreed to and imposed by society in all of its forms. Everything is described in this movie including censorship and propaganda which are all delivered under the guise of benevolent tyranny. The fact that a good portion of events described in the movie aren't historically accurate doesn't mar the precise and razor sharp script an English translation of a German Play.

	schema:reviewBody "Brilliant in every way. A film of a play about a play put on by the inmates of the Asylum of Charenton in France 1808 as directed by the Marquis de Sade played by Patrick Magee. Filmed plays are often criticized for their staginess but this one quite requires that feeling. The actors are separated from the audience which appears from time to time by metal bars which also appear from time to time. Most of the film takes place in the middle of the play with the lunatics seeming dangerously in our faces. The man who runs the asylum sits on the side behind the bars and occasionally walks out onto the stage to calm his residents down or to castigate the Marquis for including certain undesirable notions in his play. The subject of the play is the nature and importance of human cruelty as demonstrated by the French Revolution which ended some 15 years earlier but which continues on even to the present far beyond the actual setting of the play. About a thousand ideas are thrown out throughout the film and it's difficult to catch them all. It's the kind of movie that sets the head reeling and it made me want to watch it again ASAP. The actors are all brilliant. Besides Magee Glenda Jackson deserves special praise for her performance as the narcoleptic inmate who plays the executioner of Marat. I didn't mention that other name in the title because I am unfamiliar with the historical character. I understood the gist of his role in the Revolution but I'd like to learn more before I rewatch the film. Peter Brook's direction is fantastic he kept my heart rate up throught the entire film. I'm thinking about getting the DVD especially if it has subtitles. It is sometimes difficult to understand the dialogue and almost impossible to understand the song lyrics. Oh did I mention it was a musical? 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Patrick Magee A Clockwork Orange plays the Marquis de Sade the founder of sadism  who directs a play performed by people in an insane asylum as a form of a therapeutic psychodrama. The theory behind this approach is that the patient by acting can understand his or her psychiatric disorder and through acting out their traumas they are supposed to get cured. It a method still used today by psychiatrists. The Marquis de Sade is there as a political prisoner and traces the history of the French Revolution in the play he has written.The viewer sits outside the bars of a large bathroom cell where the play is performed as part of the gentry who watch the play for entertainment. Charlotte Corday  played by Glenda Jackson Lost and Found in her starring film debut has narcolepsy  a condition characterized by brief attacks of deep sleep.  Corday wants to kill Marat  because of something that happened to her mother. Marat was one the leaders of the French Revolution and contacted a skin disease while hiding in the sewers of Paris. He had to remain in the bath tub to keep his skin moist and had a nurse to care for him. Marat controlled the revolution by writing orders in his bathtub and then sending them out. Corday at the end of the play murders Jean Paul Marat in his bath tub with a dagger.Interwoven throughout the play is the Marquis the Sade's interpretation of the French Revolution. The asylum warden his wife and his daughter are inside the bathroom cell with the inmates.  The warden is constantly trying to maintain order and objecting to what the Marquis de Sade has put in the play.  The inmates also interact with the warden's wife and daughter in many funny ways. There is one scene where the inmates pretend to be using a guillotine to cut off heads.  When they cut commoners heads off they pour something red in a bucket but when they cut  the king's head off they pour blue blood in the bucket. Three of my favorite characters in the movie are a trio of people two men Kokol and Cucurucu and a woman in clown makeup who act as narrators and comic relief.This movie is rated R but there is nothing really in the movie that justifies the rating. The only sexy scene is when Corday whips the Marquis de Sade with her hair.  One other character is a sex maniac who can't keep his hands off Corday.This is a very interesting movie but is hard to follow. I have the tape and a copy of the screenplay but I am under the impression that historians who specialize in the French Revolution should have a better understanding of this ultra intellectual plot. It is a screenplay that is very hard to understand. Perhaps because those people are crazy and are showing their perception of a  reality that in my view would be different in the eyes of an average person.  By the way the actual title of this movie is The Persecution and Assassination of JeanPaul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade. A quote There is no revolution without general copulation copulation copulation.".

	schema:reviewBody "Peter Brook for many years the artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company has more than once astounded the theater world with his interpretations of familiar plays by Shakespeare and others. Here's the chance for moviegoers to witness his transformative skills in action. MaratSade which I'd seen previously on stage is a Brechtian political drama about the French revolution performed in a madhouse under the direction of the notorious Marquis de Sade. Brook's retelling takes advantage of the setting by emphasizing the particular insanities of the major players. Marat portrayed by Ian Richardson is coldly rational except when he's not. Patrick Magee's de Sade reflects that personality's obsession with cruelty. But the real brilliance of Brook's choices is captured best by Glenda Jackson who appears as a victim of narcolepsy cast in the role of Charlotte Corday Marat's assassin. Jackson's character can barely rouse herself to perform. She's confused. Her diction is odd. She's not convincing as Corday nor is she supposed to be. She's thoroughly convincing however an insane person playing someone who is obsessed with Marat. Other brilliant performances are turned in by Michael Williams as the Herald who announces key scenes Robert Landon Lloyd as Roux a cleric turned revolutionary who is seen most of the time in a straitjacket because of his violent behavior John Steiner as Monsieur Depere a sexual predator who lusts after Jackson's Corday and a quartet of three men and a woman in comedia del' arte garb who comment on the action in song and verse.It is a bizarre film difficult to watch at times but brilliant in its execution. I do not believe there is another director alive or dead who could have done what Brooks did with this script and this talented group of actors. Too bad he didn't do more movies.".

Jean Paul Marat is ultimately vilified for the people he killed just as the Black Panthers the Weathermen the Yippies and other groups and in the end regardless that their actions hurt more than they helped everyone was trying to do their best for the people. I mean to say Marat is a pathetic character condemned by nature to suffer his last days with a debilitating skin disease. In the case of the 60s radicals we have been condemned to see the world we envisioned turn away from our ideals and turn us into caricatures and stand up routines. At least those of us who didn't wind up going to prison or dying outright. The play is wonderful and speaks truth through the mouths of those condemned to an insane asylum.

	schema:reviewBody "This takes place in 1808 in an insane asylum. The Marquis de Sade Patrick Magee puts on a play of an assassination for an audience. He uses the other inmates as actors. Things slowly get out of hand leading to a truly horrifying ending.I first caught this way back in 1980 at a center for adult education. It was a video of the movie shown for free. The picture was murky and the sound was terrible. Still I sat through it. I just caught it again over 20 years later on cable. This time I could see and hear it clearly. I'm not going to pretend that I understand what this is about aside from the basic premise about a bunch of inmates putting on a play and I do know it was based on a stage play. Still I watched all 2 hours. The acting is great across the board but Magee Ian Richardson and Glenda Jackson in her major film debut are exceptional. The movie is disturbingI realize these are all actors playing roles but they're so good that you believe everything you're seeing. The direction also is masterfulit opens up the play cinematically. It has an R rating but that's mostly for subject matter and a brief nude scene with Richardson. This isn't for everybodysome people will be bored silly by itbut for those who like challenging movies this fits the bill. The ending is very disturbing. I give it a 7.".

Don't want to waste my time reviewing about this movie. If you want to watch a movie on war between India and Pakistan then watch Border Tango Charlie 1971 or Hero. But never this one. The standard of the movie is that of 80s. Watch this one if you want to get frustrated with the director screenplay actors and yourself.".

The start of the movie is gripping showing one of the nth attempts made to escape and the will to survive persecution.One attempts by a their mate is partly successful and in conveying the message to Indians. But it is in vain as the Government  Army cannot do anything. The son of Kaul Akshaye Khanna takes it upon himself to go to Pakistan and get his father back. Here's the silly part of the ease in how he enters Pakistan and goes about doing the necessary.As a reprimand for the escape attempt the prisoners are moved to a 'high security' prison where they mingle with other similar captives led by Raj Zutshi. Also there is Sunjay Dutt a goon caught on the border. He somehow manages to escape and in short teams up with Khanna for the escape where he lands up back in the jail !!.The title 'Let's bring our hero's home' is kind of misnomer as this is no rescue attempt like Behind Enemy Lines Saving Private Ryan etc.. Couple of scenes by Kay Kay a good playback singer  playing a Pakistani jail officer and Akhilendra Mishra are impressive. The heroine is a waste. A couple of songs here and there. Though the escape planning akshaye in Pakistan and some of them are lame compared to good Hollywood thrillers it is a good entertainment package.".

Yes the movie is mash of so many English POW Escape movies. But if that was the case why didn't the makers decide to choose one classic English POW and make a complete remake of it. Pakistani bashing  Oh my God!!!! Its so clumsy and cheesy that makes you wonder why it has been forced in such a gawdy manner. Guys  you need to watch Gadar and thats what I call classy Pakistani bashing.Romantic track  when do Bollywood filmmakers ever learn to do away with conventional moviemaking!!! AkshayeAmrita track is so very clich'd and aptly justifies the word forcefit.MarhabaMarhaba song  my personal opinion the latest Remix albums are much better. Milan Lutharia no but Sridhar Raghavan Yes I was expecting a lot from him. But as a writer he was a big downer. The script doesn't have holes it has craters!!!It looks like Milan Lutharia was in a hurry to finish the task at the earliest.

	schema:reviewBody "It seems so much like rhetoric that the minute it begins you already know how it is going to end. The only thing you might not be able to guess are the people who are going to die and in which order they do so.Amitabh Bachchan plays an army major who along with over three dozen Indian soldiers are trapped in Pakistani prisons and are all presumed dead. It's not like India doesn't want to recover them it's that's for 33 years Pakistan has maintained that they do not have any Indian soldier prisoners. Ranvir Kaul Bachchan desperate and determined not to die on Pakistani soil has tried to escape from the death camp 17 times all unsuccessful attempts until one day when he sabotages a routine trip and allows one of his fellow soldier who is also bearing a letter to escape. The man makes it into the slums of Pakistan and is helped by a fellow Hindustani but dies before he can be nursed back to health. Before he dies he hands his good Samaritan a letter which is then sent to India to alert the military that their soldiers are still alive. The government is hesitant to take the letter as authentic but when Gaurav Kaul played by Akshaye Khanna hears of this he vows to his mother that he will go to Pakistan and bring his father home. Thus begins a tumultuous descent to the depths of despair as he slowly becomes a rebel with a cause. Upon reaching Pakistan he traces the origin of the letter to the person who sent it and when he arrives at the man's home he meets a girl named Radhika played by Amrita Rao who is also the man's daughter. Naturally she falls in love with him but he keeps his focus on his plans. When upon the 19th prison break a mysterious stranger named Khan played by Sanjay Dutt escapes and is rescued by Gaurav signs of hope begin to materialise. The best part of the film for me is surprising not the liberation of the soldiers but the song and dance that occurs between Gaurav and Radhika one of the rare songs in the film which is also a highlight of the film. Amrita Rao looks so heavenly in this song and the playback singer matches her so perfectly that you would believe she is the one actually singing the song. The worst part of the film is the fact that Gaurav leaves her behind in Pakistan after all the bad luck he brings upon her all in the name of saving his own father. I mean what sort of fate did he bestow upon the poor girl by leaving her behind after fracturing her life?".

	schema:reviewBody "I love Amitabh Bachchan he is a big star who has a good actor sometimes super good in him too. However after his return from the short retirement in the start of the 1990s he used to make a bunch of movies per year where one is good and the rest is not. Typical I think for a man who wants to be in business all the time. In 2004 he made 11 movies at least Deewaar wasn't one of their worst!The movie's intro was so impressive and engaging. It promised me with real great time. And to tell you the truth the movie was kind of entertaining but why after its ending it collapsed easily?!Now this is a movie which wants to handle the issue of the Indian internees in Pakistan and how they're victims of both sides. So the personal solution is the only way. But the treatment of the whole thing made it as another B movie with the good and bad meanings of the term. Despite that everything and everyone looked serious it was handled usuriously. All the characters were just stereotypes without any possible deepness. There was some naivety behind a lot of the events. So ultimately the movie was superficial more than simple.Observe carefully Sanjay Dutt's character seemed at first as the perfect opportunist selfish who could literally run over the dead bodies of his fellow prisoners just to flee. Then SUDDENLY he became that faithful altruist patriotic who sacrificed his own life for the others and cried to not be buried in Pakistan??!! Then this cripple sadistic warden? What's his story? And why he is fornoreason a forever evil? But originally why to answer all of that since he's here as the B movie's villain!Moreover Akshaye Khanna as the son aside from being so pale and noncharismatic his role was so empty to the utmost what's his work besides being a saver?! For a moment I imagined that he was an officer in his country's government who got angry and resigned for doing what that government's law was unable of. But none of my reveries was true. Bachchan was just an angry old man and the genius presence would solve the rest. He was a character without any particulars or history. As a whole this movie had no real humans rather characters in a cartoon where Mickey is good Pete is bad and Goofy is goofy!Extra annoying points How the son sneaked into the enemy's country? How he knew already that his father has been transported to another prison? And the Indian prisoner who was hiding under the Pakistani military car while the transporting what did he intent to do anyway? Though still the strongest Mumbo Jumbo here was the storyline of the traitorous what a lousy one! It makes you ask eagerly if he was that long time rat then why he didn't inform about the whole matter of the tunnel from the start?!There is a clear general irony about it as it has some attractive moving plot however with hasty dealing. It isn't lazy in making action though it is in making the rest. For instance what could be the difference between someone who was never in a Pakistani prison knowing nothing about its life's details and the one who wrote this movie? Totally NOTHING! Sure the script lacked distinctive details to separate the movie from other movies such as The Great Escape  1963 to have its own personality to be more original and to live longer among its likes.The love story between the Indian boy and the Pakistani girl could have been one of the highest points of the script representing the peaceful tone of the movie and epitomizing implied message about circumstances which made this love impossible. But I think that line had been epitomized itself.I extremely loved the first sequence. Todenge Deewar Hum as the prisoners' anthem. The respectable always intense performance of Bachchan despite that the role didn't give him what could make it one of his finest roles indeed. The smart enjoyable and technically dexterous directing of Milan Luthria it got wonderful moments and on their top was the scene of hanging one of the Indian prisoners as the new prison's reception that was one memorable piece of cinema to the extent of being a visual poetry.Deewaar determined to be the commercial Indian movie. So no wonder that everything was just hot moment after another no wonder that there was an hot number and no wonder that Bachchan's character killed the warden brutally at the end while it would've been better if he was kept alive taken to India as an internee and tasted an equal portion of his torture. But who said anything about sane ending it is A BOLLYWOOD FLICK where all the good Indians must triumph all the evil Pakistanis must go to hell and all the audience must come out of theaters happy entertained and satisfied. Just thank God that it didn't contain 700 songs forced melodrama superfluous comedy or overthetop acting.It's above average as an action movie. But needed less shallowness and more authenticity to be a great movie.".

Finally a superhero movie you can relate to instead of everything being all high and mighty on morals and super powers.Defendor had it all comedy action drama and romance. What made this movie unique was the blend of genres which works really well. Initially I thought it was just a spoof of superhero movies but Defendor is so much more than that.The characters in the movie are real and believable. Hats off to Woody Harrelson for his marvelous performance as Arthur  Defendor. This role really showed off Woody's acting talents. I think we can all see parts of ourselves in the Defendor character and that is what makes this movie so powerful so gripping and so entertaining.And also to Elias Koteas for his role as the corrupt policeman and Kat Denings as her role of a young woman in drug abuse and harsh life situation. And the supporting roles were nicely portrayed as well.The story told in Defendor easily picks you up and keeps you tight. It is really good and you can place yourself in that story. It is very believable and leaves you very entertained.I was thoroughly entertained from start till end. Lots of good action really good and solid story and spectacular acting. This is definitely a keeper a movie with enough value to be watched more than once.".

	schema:headline " Clever parody juxtaposed with intriguing selfreflexive darkness  an inspired revision of the superhero myth";
	schema:reviewBody "Given the recent onslaught of superhero films hitting theatres it would seem only natural to anticipate parodic responses to the genre sending up its excesses and sillier elements. On the surface it would appear that debut director Peter Stebbings' Defendor is exactly such a film casting Woody Harrelson's oddball everyman as a surrogate crimefighter and exploiting his antics for humour in the vein of 1999's Mystery Men. And initially this is the approach the film itself appears gearing up to take opening with a hysterical spoofing of overblown superhero film clichs including rooftop billowing fog high contrast city lights against nighttime darkness and larger than life acrobatic feats always check the garbage days moans a wounded Defendor after leaping off a rooftop into a dumpster recently emptied of garbage to cushion his fall. Such astute genre awareness combined with the wonderfully imaginative collection of Defendor's makeshift crimefighting weapons including the most inspired use of marbles seen in ages could easily have assured for an hour and a half of lighthearted enjoyable cinematic fun. But Stebbings' film has grander ambitions than a mere surface level parody which subtly unfold as the film progresses. As the laughs slowly become fewer and fewer Defendor's narrative becomes steadily more engrossing settling on a tone pitched halfway between exhilarating crimemystery thriller and poignant character study as the viewer is led increasingly to question Defendor's mental stability and even the ethics of his imbalanced war against injustice. While such transitioning between tones could prove a dangerous stumbling ground Stebbings is careful to distinguish between his darker themes and moments of levity utilizing dashes of all too real violence to savagely undercut the fantasy or parodic elements. For all Defendor's silliness it certainly packs a brutal punch when necessary. Of course being the work of a first time director one would expect the occasional fumble and Stebbings' film does lose its way for a period nearing the climax meandering somewhat and losing its rhythm. Nonetheless an emerging subplot musing on the roots and importance of heroism clearly borrowing amply from Christopher Nolan's recent two Batman reboots among other sources which could have been the clumsiest addition to the movie actually emerges as surprisingly tasteful and functional adding more nuance and complexity to the unfolding film without coming across as excessively pretentious. Completing the package is the wonderfully grandiose musical score by John Rowley managing to perfectly encompass each tonal shift whether gleefully riffing on superhero musical motifs or offering something more profound and honest either way adding welcome depth and volume to a film already far from lacking in either. The casting of Woody Harrelson as the titular hapless crimefighter also proves a stroke of genius as Harrelson's naturally wacky yet powerful charisma exemplifies the essence of the film beautifully blending childlike emotional simplicity tenacious determination and enough flat out weirdness to make it all ring true as well as an inspired ripoff of Christian Bale's now iconic Batman voice. Kat Dennings is equally delightful to watch as a young prostitute who may be either befriending or manipulating Defendor warping her naturally quirky and spunky energy into something darker yet just as resonant. Elias Koteas essays antagonistic clichs with the utmost grotesque skill as a crooked cop and Michael Kelly reconciles a weakly written role with a gruff credibility as Defendor's employer and solitary friend. Finally Sandra Oh is superb in her few scenes as Defendor's psychological examiner infusing impressive dramatic tension with moments of deadpan humour and bringing welcome life to the film.It would be easy to compare Defendor as a film to its protagonist slightly cumbersome and prone to stumbling at times yet cleverly selfaware comical yet with layers of unexpected darkness and overall encompassed by such an infectious sense of classic cheesy charm that it is near impossible not to love in the end. Whether taken as a superhero parody straight out superhero film or character study or ultimately all three Defendor proves a highly enjoyable success and one easily worth a watch.7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing this back when it first came out. About 8 years later I was reminded of the movie.I love it. It sucks you in with sharp dialogue and relatable characters who you definitely root for until the end. Not only all of that but the storymessage is beautifully done. Defendor isn't like other super hero movies though. It doesn't follow the same bland pattern we all know and love or hate. Arthur doesn't fly or have super powers. He is simply a guy in a makeup mask who protects people with homemade weapons he uses a jar of wasps among other things  whose purpose in life is to capture Captain Industry. Kat Debrofkowitz isn't your regular damsel in distress either. She is a young prostitute who first meets Arthur when he beats up Chuck Dooney for being a punk with a badge. The whole first half of the movie is being told through ArthurDefendor giving his deposition to Dr. Park explaining why he assaulted Mr. Debrofkowitz Kat's dad. There Kat knowingly lies to Arthur telling him Radovan Kristic played by A.C Peterson is Captain Industry  when he is in fact not  because she figures they both want revenge so it'd be a winwin. The second half is happening in real time.At the end when DefendorArthur gets shot I cry every single time. I can't help it and I rarely cry watching movies. Woody Harrelson and Kat Dennings make a great team. Elias Koteas plays the prefect badcopdouchebag. Sandra Oh is very believable in her role too. The whole cast did a stellar job but major props to Peter Stebbings for taking a washed up premise and making it fresh beautiful inspiring and for the ages.".

Sancho Panza is replaced by a saner but similarly pliant crackaddict Kat and Rosindante is supplanted by his 'defendog' mobile.There are other similarities the movie has with D. Quixote but to mention those would give the game away. It will suffice to say however that the film is quite highly recommended by this viewer if not just for the joy of seeing Don Quixote once again take to the streets in all his glory.".

	schema:reviewBody "My God Woody Harrelson is on top of his game and is on a roll this past couple of years. I was very excited to see this movie it looked like it would be fun. Not to mention I am a huge Batman fan only Christopher Nolan's dark versions. Bruce Wayne is a billionaire and he can afford to be the superhero but how could a normal man be a superhero vigilante? Defendor is the answer  one has to be an extremely justice minded and fearless person but not so naive as Arthur Poppington in this movie he uses marbles instead of guns his batmobile is a jacked up truck and he uses lemon juice as acid! I thought I would at the very least smile through the film with the bumbling Defendor who took himself far too seriously but ended up shedding a few tears. The acting and the settings are incredibly realistic I loved this movie.During the day Arthur Poppington Woody Harrelson is a normal man even if slightly naive to the workings of the world working in the construction industry. During the night time he transforms into his alterego Defendor protecting the streets from thugs. The city has a problem with thugs and nobody is prepared to stand up and fight for themselves. The police are slow to catch the wrongdoers and Arthur has a huge willpower to do what he can to help the people. He helps Kat Kat Dennings one night from Dooney  when she really didn't need any help  she was a hooker. Dooney Elias Koteas is a corrupt cop in the police force and he is in cahoots with a Serbian mob boss. Arthur has been searching for Captain industry all his life as he had killed his mother. Kat and Arthur become friends and Defendor goes after Captain Industry knowing that there is a very high chance of dying or getting arrested.Director Peter Stebbings has made a classic film which will be remembered for ages to come. The dialogues are simply awesome and the background score is very cheesy but it works. Although I was excited I didn't think I would like this film as much as I did. Woody Harrelson and Kat Dennings give amazing performances which broke my heart they have perfect chemistry. Arthur is a very childlike adult who thinks he can be a superhero and that guns are for cowards. He is very honest with everybody but bumbles up a police investigation in the matter of the mob boss. I rooted for his character all through and the climax was brilliant. He says to Kat I will see you on the moon and in that scene I really had some tears in my eyes. He fights for justice even when he is gravely wounded and talks like a real hero. Elias Koteas and Sandra Oh as the psychiatrist also gave good performances. Others worthy of mention are his little cousin and the cousin's dad Paul. Give this a chance and you just might end up falling in love with Defendor! 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Defendor is the story of a simple deluded childlike man who thinks he's a superhero. In all likelihood he should have died a swift and brutal death no later than ten minutes in but it seems that God watches out for the simpleminded even in movies. Somehow Defendor even ends up bumbling his way into doing some good.Woody Harrelson portrayed Arthur in a way that completely avoided mocking him. Imagine Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump. Arthur has definite reasons for his quest and his actions and as those reasons are revealed during the movie you become more and more attached to his character. Kat Dennings plays a young prostitute who befriends Arthur and is instrumental in helping him to his final destiny and Sandra Oh stars as a psychiatrist who learns about Arthur along with the audience. No one is responsible for the acting burden that Harrelson has but their performances are still solid.I liked this movie a good bit. It was funny in some parts and sad in others.

In all likelihood he should have died a swift and brutal death no later than ten minutes in but it seems that God watches out for the simpleminded even in movies. Somehow Defendor even ends up bumbling his way into doing some good.Woody Harrelson portrayed Arthur in a way that completely avoided mocking him. Imagine Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump.

There are some brilliantly funny and memorable moments in Defendor Oh no please not the lime juice! but this is not a comedy in the strictest sense. It's actually a pretty serious drama slash crime thriller. The only glaring flaw in Defendor is the character of Kat played by Kat a character who is much too together and with it to be a crack addicted prostitute but the wide range of emotion in her acting makes up for the implausibility of the writing she is dealing with. We almost want Defendor to go a little farther in his wacky vigilantism involving swarms of hornets and marbles but in some ways it's good that the movie doesn't stray too far away from reality. In fact we get the sense that Defendor isn't as crazy as everyone thinks he is that he's actually well aware that he's really just a normal guy play acting which makes his heroism all the more potent.

He befriends a prostitute named Kat all because she lies to him and tells him she knows Captain Industry when she's well aware he doesn't exist. She wants revenge Arthur belives her and with the money he's giving her for this information she can buy drugs. The beginning is Arthur explaining why he assaulted Mr. Debrofkawitz who macked on Kat. Her father assaulted her. He rightfully gets angry at this and busts up his dry cleaning business.The movie takes a turn when Dooney a sleaze bag cop uses Kat as leverage so Arthur doesn't talk about the illegal sex ring they're operating. At the end Defendor dies but his heroics keep him alive throughout town. He is known as the guy who wanted to clean up the city and make it a better place.This movie has charm. No fancy superpowers no elaborate stunts flying fights  just a normal guy with a homemade weapons and a makeup mask. It's a pretty old movie but it's definitely a golden one.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you've seen the trailer for this film you would more than likely be expecting another typical Superhero comedy spoof in the likes of Kickass and Mystery Men. Fortunetly or unfortunately depending on which type of film you want to watch the trailer is actually very misleading as in I myself thought I was going to be watching a funny superhero spoof starring the very talented Woody Harrelson as a vigilante hero known as Defendor which I was totally o.k. with.What I actually got was a brilliant and compelling story about a simple man Woody who's lack of intelligence and grip on reality result in him suitingup in a homemade superhero outfit arming himself with lethal weapons such as marbles and angry wasps and taking to the streets to fight crime! More often than none he ends up getting the crp beaten out of him by petty thugs and nearly killed several times in the film as you can imagine.Sounds funny right? And for the most part  it is. There are some genuinely funny parts granted the humour is a little dark in Defendor yet the overall story is actually quite moving and somewhat heartwarming. The main ingredient which makes this film work on this level is the brilliant performance given by Woody Harrelson. He breathes so much life into a character that could have so easily been portrayed as silly and slapstickish but instead you really end up feeling for the guy. Here is a man who is brutally honest extremely childlike in his behaviour and naivety he doesn't have many friends who really is just trying to make the world a better place by removing the scumbags! Whether it be the humorous oneliner superhero babble Defendor spews from his mouth or the quieter more subtle honest lines  Woody delivers with such conviction it's hard not to love this character.Defendor is definitely a character driven film. Everything else from the story to the action scenes to the comedy are secondary features to a fascinating character study of human behaviour and morals.Along with Zombieland also filmed 2009 Woody Harrelson is fast becoming a household name again and if he keeps it up  he'll no doubt be up there with Depp and Downey Jr in a quirky character league of his own!I highly recommend Defendor to anyone who enjoys films that are a little different and who enjoy memorable character stories.Just don't be fooled by the trailer!!!".

In good 80s fashion the plot revolves around a secret weapon which cannot fall into enemy hands.In the Reaganesque Defense Play storyline we see the United States Air Force attempting to launch a top secret satellite into orbit on a Saturn V rocket of all things.  To foil the US satellite launch the KGB plans to steal a topsecret remotely piloted stealth helicopter codenamed 'DART' being produced at a local university.  Because DART is so small it cannot be easily detected and therefore would be optimal for use in attacking the well defended USAF Saturn V at Vandenburg AFB.The hero and heroine of Defense Play are your classic allAmerican teenagers who get 'tangled' in the nefarious plot and decide to take down the bad guys.All in all Defense Play is a good halfdecent low budget film which might appeal particularly to the teens and follows in the fashion and style of such 80s films as Iron Eagle My Science Project Real Genius The Rescue and many others.  It serves as a good flashback to the days when low budget producers didn't have an F117 and tons of F117 stock footage to make as the centerpiece of all the action the official 'blow up plane' of the 80s was desert camoflauged F16s.Defense Play is an obscure film but well worth watching if you just want to kick back and have a few laughs.".

There are so many trashy 80's films geared toward teens and the immature college crowd it can be overwhelming trying to find treasure within all of the trash. I was mostly interested in Defense Play because of Susan Ursitti. I had just watched Teen Wolf the night before and wondered where the likable Boof had gone. Defense Play was her next feature film. While Ursitti's dialogue was stilted she was still the most charming character of the lot.There are a few other seasoned 80's supporting actors peppered in here and there but most of the screentime is hogged by our generic hunk David Oliver. It's hard for people to sympathize with a spoiled athletic military college playboy but Oliver managed to be fairly tolerable while having everything.Other than Ursitti the poster art and plot were the true hooks for me full of 80s shticks. Airwolf meets Russian war games? Smartly budgetwise the movie features a radio controlled military drone gone amok and the jet stock footage that favors can buy.The plot was predictable and I knew who the secret bad guy was by the second act but the chuckle factor was pretty high. If you now what to expect you won't be disappointed. It's a cheesy 80's movie that barely avoided going directly to VHS.

This is the story of two teens one clearly too old to play a teenager thanks to that shirtless scene in the introduction of his character on an army base who stumble upon a Soviet plot to infiltrate an American weapons defense system by hiring posing as Americans in the program.I was expecting another War Games ripoff they don't tell you much about the teens' role in the plot synopsis on the box but was glad to learn it was not. Granted the story does make itself incredibly overt at times especially in the characters and the comic bookesque professor and most of his dialog but the movie is not too ridden with bad acting except from Susan Ursitti who adds to most of the cheesiness with some forced grief here and there implausible plot or cheap effects. In fact our protagonists are actually smart teenagers who do their homework well when it comes to dodging dangerous Soviet assassins. It's a bit of a ridiculous story in the same sense that Red Dawn was a ridiculous story about a handful of teenagers single handedly saving the world from terrorist destruction but done with just the right amount of favor towards the teen characters. This plus a wellpaced story for the most part makes this a betterthan average B80s movie. Most likely worth the time of energetic teenage boys but nostalgic fans may tolerate it...if this is the kind of story you enjoy.".

Then it continued with 4 or 5 copies I think and a few months later it became the biggest hype in the German movie underground. Everybody between 15 and 27 knows this film or has heard of it. Youths find it hip to talk with the slang of the characters and their are also a lot of persons who know the dialogues from inside out. Dei Mudder... got some bad critics because its often said that it is hostile to foreigners. But when you watch this film you recognize exactly that this movie is only a satire and a parody. I personally think its the ideal party movie  invite some friends drink some beer and you will laugh so hard I promise!!! Although this film has got nearly no plot the special FX are home made and all is filmed with a handy cam. But Dei Mudder... takes his charm from the fact that everything looks so cheap and stupid. I know a lot of people who hate this film and say this shot could be done by everyone. Well they are probably right but the fact that a primitive work like this one reached such an immense success is nearly a phenomenon.

It was the first film for both and stayed the only film for Strohn while Mora kept making more movies about his trademark character Kermet Dnger. The quality of this 90minute film however is pretty much what you would expect from the title. It is amateurish trash and it becomes painfully obvious how everybody involved with this project lacks talent in writing camera work acting and filmmaking in general. It does look extremely amateurish and you know immediately that nobody working on this one was really experienced in film.Some people also if you look at the rating like it because it adds some charm that the ones who made this were still fresh and daring in their work but I cannot share this opinion. There was hardly any scene that I found only mildly funny and the humor is even way below Mario Barth level. The main actor playing an older lady in a costume is a joke that only works for one or two scenes and it becomes embarrassing quickly afterward. The only thing positive you can say is probably that the people who made this never wanted it to becomes as famous as it did. So the ones who are to blame are the fans who shared this complete garbage movie. I recommend you to stay far far away and I have zero interest to see Mora's followup projects. At least Strohn learned something from it. Watch something else instead.".

This left me wanting.With regards to the plot element We care about Tom and Sofia but Tom acts like an idiot and Sofia appears to brush him off too easily. Of course this is to play into the plot but it was too hard to believe after the beginning was set up so solidly. The result is a plot that cannot maintain it's credibility through to the end. It's a light film so this isn't the greatest of crimes.All in all it is enjoyable but it's middle of the road fare and certainly not worth the 8.1 rating that it is currently riding at. Rather somewhere between a five and a six depending on your perspectives and your mood. If you are rating this film higher go watch Zach in Garden State and rethink your rating. That film is truly worth it's current 8 rating.Enough said 5 of 10.".

They're all superb Zach Braff is hilarious and you love to hate Jason Batemen's character. Charles Grodin's character was also particularly funny.If there were halves I'd give this movie a 7.5 but there isn't but let me tell you why I always start my movie grading at 9 and then add on an extra point if the movie is just jaw droppingly awesome. So for this movie I took of one point for the sole fact that while the actors were fine the script did not use them to their full potential. And then I also took off half a point because it seems like there was a lot more to the movie that was cut out.So there you go and a word to the wise get the Rated version the Unrated version is not nearly as good as the original.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Ex";
	schema:reviewBody "If I were to look at it I would say The Ex aka Fast Track forms a loose trilogy of sorts with regards to growing up and somewhat like a natural progression in the different stages of life that Zach Braff's characters form when stringed together. With Garden State it's in the 20s where you're having a feel for the ground exploring your options and not knowing exactly what life will dish out to you.With One Last Kiss so you think that you're dead sure about your other half you're getting married and vowing to spend the rest of your lives together and suddenly an ingenue comes along and cast doubts about that.Plenty of whatwillyoudo moments with outcome that are different depending on your values but totally possible and brought out earnestly through Braff's performance as the everyday man. In The Ex Zach Braff plays the blue collar salaryman whose hotshot lawyer wife had just given birth and as agreed she'll be a stay home mum. But he just got fired from his job thus sending their agreement into red alert zone. Taking up his father in law's offer he uproots himself wife and baby and starts work in a new age advertising company only to meet up with his wife's ex.You'd come to expect the usual jokes about not fitting into a totally different corporate culture with its own idiosyncrasies conflict with the parents and the constant threat posed by the wife's ex Chip Sanders played by Jason Bateman which I bet almost every male would want to kill given his attitude and back stabbing nature. It's classic office politics at work as we root for the survival of Zach's Tom Reilly though at times you'd expect him to have a little more backbone and a little bit of smarts to survive the jungle out there.If that sounds a little like Meet The Parents it does. And it also is styled after Just Friends in the rivalry department where two guys do battle over a girl only that this time it's the third party up against a married couple. Though I'd say it again nothing beats riling you up when you see how the bastard at work gets away with almost everything and get incensed with his obvious intentions to bang his ex i.e. the wife.The flow of the movie did seem a little broken at times which I suspect that there were a lot more filmed than was put on screen perhaps saving them for the DVD release. The ideas injected into the movie were numerous but that made for the narrative feeling a little scattered. For instance Amanda Peet as the wife Sofia Kowalski didn't really have much to do except nurse the baby and be in some of the most trying comedic scenes such as the ones involving yoga.Fans of Braff will not want to miss yet another familiar performance and remember to stay tune during the credits for a coda as well as various bloopers some of which are genuinely funnier than the bits that made it to the movie.".

	schema:headline " Great performances from Braff and Bateman in an otherwise imperfect film";
	schema:reviewBody "Ever since his directorial debut of Garden State I have been an avid Zach Braff fan. I liked him on Scrubs loved him in State thought The Last Kiss was great and really enjoyed his vocal work in Chicken Little although the movie itself left a lot to be desired. So when The Ex was finally set to be released I obviously looked forward to seeing it. And while he was great as always the movie was a bit off from his other works.The Ex revolves around Tom Braff who jumps from job to job as he prepares for the birth of his first child with wife Sofia Amanda Peet. After getting fired from a promising job he decides that the new family should move back to where Sofia's parents live and take up the job that Sofia's father Bob Charles Grodin has always been offering. But after he takes the position he gets paired off with hotshot paraplegic Chip Jason Bateman who just happens to be Sofia's friend and lover in high school and is really not too keen on Tom.The plot may sound contrived but the final product is a bit of a mishmash of great and not so great ideas.On the side of being great are the hilarious performances from Braff and Bateman. Although he is more of a madcap screwball here Braff still delivers a poignancy to the role. In a way it felt a bit more mature than his work in State and Kiss as he is no longer dealing in existential phobias. Here he is more of a man without a plan and he gives it his all. He has his hysterical moments and he has his moments of pure drama. And all for the most part work great. You can see the obvious traces of his other characters but he makes this character much more than just another shade of Andrew Largeman. Bateman on the other hand steals the show as Braff's nemesis. His quick changing gears from nice ambitious guy to a cold and calculating egocentric sociopath is intriguing to watch and delivers the majority of the laughs throughout the film. And even at the most ridiculous times Bateman stays straightladen and never gives into any other feelings but that of his character.Also on the great side are amusing character performances from Grodin Mia Farrow as Sofia's mother and Fred Armisen as Tom and Chip's coworker Manny. All do great in their small roles and make for some really funny interactions with Braff and Bateman.The script also offers a great story albeit not very deeply intellectual with plenty of moral overtones. While it could have just been a simple revengestyle flick it does tend to open itself up a bit more with a few subplots. And while at least one seems a bit useless the majority all tie in quite nicely and make for great development of characters. As said previously it has some pretty hysterical moments and a few chuckle filled moments inbetween.But the laughs do not last for the length of the entire movie. There are long dry spells where nothing funny happens and instead just leave room for either cringing or a begging of patience for the next joke. The subplots work yes but there are a few that feel tacked on just to stretch out the running time as if the filmmakers knew that what they had would not cut it so they ordered a few extensions. And some of these sequences feel rather painfully obvious where they have been placed but some feel right at home and would not be looked at any different had they not been tacked on. Some of the characters are a bit extraneous as well specifically Amy Adams as a rival mother to Peet while others just look like they drifted in from off the street looking for work because their last TV gig did not work out all too well. Thankfully the majority of these bit players are alright in their small roles but nonetheless feel a bit like a reunion of failed television series actors.Another problem is with the tone of the script. It jumps around far too often never settling on whether it wants to be a Farrelly Brothersesquire madcap comedy or a darkly twisted Coen Brothersstyle comedy. The scenes just do not all jive together and much like the subplots feel like they were tacked on during production. While the story works cohesively the comedic moments just feel awkward in some places. I can laugh at anything so it did not bug me totally. But for anyone looking for just some lighthearted fun at the movies it may turn out to be a problem.As well Peet feels out of place. Although she is younger than Bateman and just slightly older than Braff her character acts far too mature to interact with either of them. They both are out of her league and when she is trying to display emotions suggesting thoughts to the contrary they just do not work. I know her character is supposed to be more than just a stayathome mother but she just looks and acts too old for the part she is supposed to be playing. And of course her character is fodder for many mentions that never come to fruition. She is just far too serious and stern for the material and when she is not trying her best not to show it she just looks like a snob acting solely for a paycheque.Although there are problems with it The Ex does have its great moments and has some very funny performances from Braff and Bateman not to mention the first role for Charles Grodin in well over a decade. Just do not go in expecting another complex and intricate Braff comedy.710.".

Although he is more of a madcap screwball here Braff still delivers a poignancy to the role. In a way it felt a bit more mature than his work in State and Kiss as he is no longer dealing in existential phobias. Here he is more of a man without a plan and he gives it his all. He has his hysterical moments and he has his moments of pure drama. And all for the most part work great. You can see the obvious traces of his other characters but he makes this character much more than just another shade of Andrew Largeman. Bateman on the other hand steals the show as Braff's nemesis. His quick changing gears from nice ambitious guy to a cold and calculating egocentric sociopath is intriguing to watch and delivers the majority of the laughs throughout the film. And even at the most ridiculous times Bateman stays straightladen and never gives into any other feelings but that of his character.Also on the great side are amusing character performances from Grodin Mia Farrow as Sofia's mother and Fred Armisen as Tom and Chip's coworker Manny. All do great in their small roles and make for some really funny interactions with Braff and Bateman.The script also offers a great story albeit not very deeply intellectual with plenty of moral overtones. While it could have just been a simple revengestyle flick it does tend to open itself up a bit more with a few subplots. And while at least one seems a bit useless the majority all tie in quite nicely and make for great development of characters. As said previously it has some pretty hysterical moments and a few chuckle filled moments inbetween.But the laughs do not last for the length of the entire movie. There are long dry spells where nothing funny happens and instead just leave room for either cringing or a begging of patience for the next joke. The subplots work yes but there are a few that feel tacked on just to stretch out the running time as if the filmmakers knew that what they had would not cut it so they ordered a few extensions. And some of these sequences feel rather painfully obvious where they have been placed but some feel right at home and would not be looked at any different had they not been tacked on. Some of the characters are a bit extraneous as well specifically Amy Adams as a rival mother to Peet while others just look like they drifted in from off the street looking for work because their last TV gig did not work out all too well. Thankfully the majority of these bit players are alright in their small roles but nonetheless feel a bit like a reunion of failed television series actors.Another problem is with the tone of the script. It jumps around far too often never settling on whether it wants to be a Farrelly Brothersesquire madcap comedy or a darkly twisted Coen Brothersstyle comedy. The scenes just do not all jive together and much like the subplots feel like they were tacked on during production. While the story works cohesively the comedic moments just feel awkward in some places. I can laugh at anything so it did not bug me totally. But for anyone looking for just some lighthearted fun at the movies it may turn out to be a problem.As well Peet feels out of place. Although she is younger than Bateman and just slightly older than Braff her character acts far too mature to interact with either of them. They both are out of her league and when she is trying to display emotions suggesting thoughts to the contrary they just do not work. I know her character is supposed to be more than just a stayathome mother but she just looks and acts too old for the part she is supposed to be playing. And of course her character is fodder for many mentions that never come to fruition. She is just far too serious and stern for the material and when she is not trying her best not to show it she just looks like a snob acting solely for a paycheque.Although there are problems with it The Ex does have its great moments and has some very funny performances from Braff and Bateman not to mention the first role for Charles Grodin in well over a decade. Just do not go in expecting another complex and intricate Braff comedy.710.";

	schema:reviewBody "Originally this movie was titled Fast Track since it's about an upandcoming marketing guy who's on the proverbial way up at his fatherinlaw's firm. But then it was changed to The Ex which shifted the focus from the workplace to the home. But let's get this straight Either name is infinitely better then the unhealthy dollop of meanspirited junk that appears after the title card on the screen.Tom Zach Braff has been fired from his job as a chef at a hoitytoity restaurant so he and his wife Sofia Amanda Peet and their newborn baby schlep from New York to Ohio where Sofia's dad Bob Charles Grodin has not only set Tom up with a new job but also has procured a nice little house for them to raise their new family in. Aww ain't that sweet. But things don't start off well for Tom at the marketing firm which turns out to be both new age and well wacko. You know a place where such creative aspects as casual dress unwalled offices an imaginary ball of ideas or something abound. Tom has some issues with fitting in with the eclectic quirky crew but more importantly he clashes immediately with his new supervisor Chip Jason Bateman who just happens to be a former schoolmate of Sofia. Oh and a paraplegic of course.But don't worry although it seems like this is a romantic comedy about jealousy and redemption about a young couple getting past their differences to survive as a unit it's set up to be more like a slapstick comedy with many jokes at Chip's expense. Which is okay because Chip is a real jerk. The sad reality though is that the movie fails at both genres. Women won't like it because there's no real romance no genuine feelings on anyone's part. Sorry to generalize ladies. Guys won't like it because there's not nearly enough physical humor. That would be fine except there's hardly any subtle humor either. What you're left with is just vicious meanspiritedness that drains every ounce of humor from an otherwise talented cast.Braff's not terrible but I never got the sense that he was well believable as someone women would desire. But what do I know I'm a straight male. The affection between him and Peet seemed forced tentative and unnatural sort of like unwilling siblings. Peet wasn't bad either but she didn't have much to work with  on a positive note she doesn't come off as icily unappealing as she does in most of her other films.And man check out Charles Grodin. I had to check to see who was playing Sofia's dad  Grodin who hadn't been in a movie in 13 years looks about 85 years old here. I thought he was Bob Eubanks. There's one scene too in which Bob utters the fword. For no freaking reason other than to have Charles Grodin septuagenarian drop an fbomb.Interestingly enough the unrated version of the movie runs about five minutes shorter than the rated one that was seen in theater. And having seen the unrated one I couldn't tell you about any particular scenes that were so raw that they would have pushed the rating to an unwanted NC17. So I have to assume that the rated one was even tamer and thus even crappier.Sad and predictable in its attempt at comedy The Ex is a waste of time. You'll be clawing your eyes out at the numbing awfulness.".

His is father inlaw helps find him a job and that's how this whole thing begins.I repeat this is a funny movie jason bateman is great and is actually the shining diamond in the film along with charles grodin. Both of them are very funny through the movie pulling chuckles laughs and rolls of the eyes because these two characters are charismatic but absurdly off on tangents.I definitely give this film a thumbs up to see with your girlfriend or wife and it shouldn't be defined as a chick flick. I would put this in the realms of films like Meet the Parents. If you liked that movie you will probably enjoy The Ex. Hope this reviewcomment was useful.".

But there's good reason it was a straighttoDVD release. It's not funny.Its biggest problem is with characterization. Zach Braff plays the everyman which is good casting because Braff plays the everyman with a comedic touch quite well. So well in fact that we connect to him. He wants to treat his wife well work hard and impress his inlaws. We want him to succeed just as much as he does. But then we start finding out that his wife Amanda Peet has no likable qualities and continues to force his life into hell his inlaws of course are completely stubborn and his coworker Jason Bateman is a competitive backstabbing exboyfriend of his wife. Obviously things don't go well for our hero and they don't go well for the entire course of the movie.For this to work as a comedy we need to understand our hero's connection to his wife we need to see that there's a way in to connect with his inlaws and we need to know that other characters see what the ex is really like but the writers didn't give us any of that. Instead we have to sit there while our hero who is essentially us is being tortured for no good reason and with no way out. I certainly wasn't laughing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dil Aashna Hai is mostly associated today with Shah Rukh Khan's name as it was one of his earliest films and how can anyone not wonder what this phenomenal film star was like way before the craze that followed soon after. But it is is also the first directorial venture of Hema Malini herself a huge star and one of the most popular actresses in Indian films. And sadly it was also one of the last films starring the young and talented Divya Bharti.Dil Aashna Hai leaves one wishing for more. As mentioned above Hema Malini was a successful mainstream star but she experimented with serious cinema as well well in several films directed by Gulzar such as Khushboo Kinara and Meera as well as other attempts with Rihaee Ek Chadal Maili Si and the likes. Sadly unlike Rekha or Dimple Kapadia she never got due recognition for these efforts to leave a mark as an actor. And Neither does this film.Knowing of Malini's experimental acting choices one wishes Dil Aashna Hai had more depth but instead we are presented with a most formulaic script and a rather typical starstudded product which lacks originality and offers nothing new in story or execution. The film has multiple subplots but every story is too repetitive although the concept of one girl looking for her biological mother from a sea of options is not too bad.Given the extraordinary number of famous faces the film might have been quite an attraction back when it opened and rightly so. The trio of Dimple Kapadia Amrita Singh and Sonu Walia is very good since all three of them have great screen presence even if some or better where strinctly acting is concerned. Kapadia is obviously given more importance but all three are good. Jeetendra and Mithun Chakraborty replay the romantic heroes they played countless times back when they were younger.The only source of freshness in an otherwise dull story which lacks originality is in the lead pair of Divya Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan. Bharti is the film's main protagonist and she is very enrgetic and convincing as the young orphan looking for her roots. Khan in one of his early films is not given enough scope or the freedom to let himself go wild at the camera as he would do so famously later on but he is good enough within the framework of the film and is good support for Bharti.Dil Aashna Hai is actually much better than expected at the end of the day. Despite its lack of ideas it works to a considerable extent. The story flows well and Hema Malini's direction is not bad at all. The film's many stars give the film a sort of energy and interest not warranted by the script and those fond of Hindi films always like their heroes and heroines gathered together in one film so those looking for some nostalgic entertainment might want to give it a try at their own cost.".

This was the first film SRK signed but Deewana released first in June 1992. Both had the pretty Divya Bharti as his heroine. Dil Aashna hai was loosely based on British TV series Lace 1984 which is about a call girl searching for her real mother. Interestingly Hema Malini used the same story with few changes and made Tell Me O Khuda in 2011 with her daughter Esha Deol.I saw Dil Aashna Hai on its very first day on VHS and found it an okey dokey fare. SRK and Divya had great onscreen chemistry which was evident in Deewana also. The older stars like Jeetendra Mithun Dimple and Amrita were wasted though!!RegardsSumeet Nadkarni.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hema Malini was a good actress but as a director she failed to give hit films. This film was also supposed to be Shah Rukh Khan's debut but thankfully Deewana came and gave him his first hit. Otherwise this movie would be his debut and yes this movie was a box office disaster.The movie is about a young girl you is brought up in a brothel she makes a living as a cabaret dancer in some other guy's club. She is not a happy person as she knows her mom is alive but can't find her with the help of a friendplayed by SRK she goes on a search. However the search gets complicated as many people are not as they seem to be and too many characters create a confusion. Will the girl find her dear mother? Will she be able to bring a permanent smile on her face? Watch the movie to find out.The movie is all about a search to find the girl's mother and the search goes well but there are too many subplots which drags the film. The attention a viewer has on the main plot is not long lasting as the subplots tend to bore the viewer. The film is lengthy and editing is not well conducted as the film has many rough patches. To make matters worse there are quite a lot of arguments and problems between characters and the overacting in these scenes tend to irritate. Music is the saving grace thanks to a couple of good tunes but none of them are up to the mark none of them became hits.Direction by Hema Malini is poor she fails for the most part. She handles a few scenes well and the comic scenes are good for its time although clichd in parts. Her direction falls flat when the emotional and serious parts of the movie occur it looks unintentionally funny in some scenes. The end is also not justified and the subplots don't connect with the main plot which means all these subplots move parallel as a result there is no flow in the storyline of the film.Performances are anything great either SRK is functional but this is one of his earlier films and he wasn't much of a good actor. He did much better in Raju Ban Gaya Gentlemen and Baazigar after which he actually started to rock as an actor. The heroine has a meatier role than SRK and she does a decent job the rest overact horribly. Even veteran actor Mithun Chakraborty does a bland job this is one of his weak films.On the whole Di Aashna Hai is a poor film it fails for the most part though a few scenes are worth watching. However the movie in general is a wasted product. Die hard SRK fans might like it but this is definitely not one of SRK's good films.".

	schema:headline " 3 Good Reasons To Watch This Film";
	schema:reviewBody "There are three reasons that movie fans should check this film out if you haven't seen it yet1  Outstanding dialog. I can't recall a film in which I heard so many clever filmnoir lines as this one. Almost everyone in the movie has a unique way of expressing their feelings. It makes the movie one that you want to go back and HEAR again. Clifford Odets and Ernest Lehman wrote the screenplay and deserve special recognition as well as the people below.2  Fabulous acting led by the two male leads Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster. Curtis is the star of the film with many more lines than anyone else and many consider this to be his greatest acting achievement. I have no quarrel with that. It's one of the finest acting jobs I've ever witnessed by anyone. It's that good. Lancaster is memorable and plays to his strengths as a tough guy not only with his physical presence but his tactless and cutting verbal assaults. He has the best and most brutal lines in the film.The minor characters in here from the cop to the comedian to the cigarette girl to the young romantic couple are all topnotch.3  The cinematography. A big name in the film business James Wong Howe more than lives up to his reputation. This is beautifully photographed and looks absolutely stunning on DVD. I have watched hundreds and hundreds of blackandwhite films and this ranks with the best of them. He captured nighttime New York City as well as anybody ever has done.Well you might ask if this movie is so great why haven't I heard more about it?Maybe because it never did well at the box office. It wasn't promoted a lot from what I heard and the storyline is not a pleasant one. Basically this is about two immoral people who smear a nice guy so that it will ruin the romance between he and Lancaster's sister. Lancaster plays an absolutely ruthless newspaper columnist who makes and breaks careers and Curtis plays his slimy pressagent who will do anything to please his powerful boss including doing the worst of his dirty work.Furrther details of the film can be read by many of the other fine reviewers here on this website so no need to go into that.I am not one who generally likes films that feature mostly nasty people but this was done so well that it fascinates me every time. A final tip of the hat to director Alexander Mackendrick. Why he wasn't given more films to direct is a mystery to me. Highlyrecommended.".

It's one of the finest acting jobs I've ever witnessed by anyone. It's that good. Lancaster is memorable and plays to his strengths as a tough guy not only with his physical presence but his tactless and cutting verbal assaults. He has the best and most brutal lines in the film.The minor characters in here from the cop to the comedian to the cigarette girl to the young romantic couple are all topnotch.3  The cinematography. A big name in the film business James Wong Howe more than lives up to his reputation. This is beautifully photographed and looks absolutely stunning on DVD. I have watched hundreds and hundreds of blackandwhite films and this ranks with the best of them. He captured nighttime New York City as well as anybody ever has done.Well you might ask if this movie is so great why haven't I heard more about it?Maybe because it never did well at the box office. It wasn't promoted a lot from what I heard and the storyline is not a pleasant one. Basically this is about two immoral people who smear a nice guy so that it will ruin the romance between he and Lancaster's sister. Lancaster plays an absolutely ruthless newspaper columnist who makes and breaks careers and Curtis plays his slimy pressagent who will do anything to please his powerful boss including doing the worst of his dirty work.Furrther details of the film can be read by many of the other fine reviewers here on this website so no need to go into that.I am not one who generally likes films that feature mostly nasty people but this was done so well that it fascinates me every time. A final tip of the hat to director Alexander Mackendrick. Why he wasn't given more films to direct is a mystery to me. Highlyrecommended.";

	schema:reviewBody "MILD SPOILERS It is amazing the number of different ways a great film can weave its alluring web and pull you into its story. Of my 100 favorite films this one's journey into that rarefied status is unique based on but a single viewing. I saw Sweet Smell of Success when I was too young to really grasp the subterranean motivations of the characters who so vividly populate the film. I did not understand for instance why this powerful loathsome gossip columnist Burt Lancaster's JJ Hunsecker who so clearly despised Tony Curtis' Sidney Falco press agent nonetheless tolerated his presence. There was much that I DID appreciatethe brilliant and daring acting of the two leads the beautifully oppressive cinematography and the scintillating dialoguebut after that single viewing the film slowly faded from my consciousness. Twentyfive or 30 years later I decided to make a list of my favorite movies and came across the title of this film. Apparently memories of seeing this production had been roiling around my unconscious all this time and now triggered by the little blurb in the Leonard Maltin book these halfforgotten images came bounding back into mind now concatenated with a quarter century of life and moviegoing experience. Honing my list over the next few months and considering this film's merits I more and more began to realize what a truly marvelous work this was. This was a study nonpareil of two creatures wholly wrapped up in themselves and their ambition yet bound together in a mutual parasitism the term symbiosis sounds much too nice to describe their relationship. I understood finally why JJ tolerated Falco's presence. He NEEDED Falco. It wasn't just that Falco would occasionally offer up tidbits that he could use in his column. It wasn't that the fawning Falco could be manipulated into performing certain . . . uh tasks that were too dirty for JJ to touch. No as a ruthless powermonger he needed the treacherous sycophant as a constant reminder and test of his superiority. Falco could be demeaned and ridiculed but he also represented a danger a challenge. Falco might seem a toady but he was also a cobra waiting his chance to strike and Hunsecker relished his role as sadistic snake charmer. Watching these two play at their oppressive games of perfidy and dealing dirt provide a fascinating character study perhaps the equal of the more famous examination of one Charles Foster Kane in an earlier film. There are many other characters in the movie such as JJ's sister and her lover and some are played with great aplomb but they are all pawns in this disdainful dance between JJ and Falco and it is their personalities that stay with you long after the lights come back on.Everything about this movie seems to be nearly perfect some have criticised the film for the relatively weak portrayal of the two hapless lovers but a stronger emphasis on these two would only detract from the real focusJJ and Sidney even to the choice of names. JJ Hunsecker and Sidney Falco seem perfect monikers by themselves conjuring up images of loathsome characters. Unfortunately for the team that put together this masterpiece of filmnoir Sweet Smell of Success was no success and critics and moviegoers alike left the theaters convinced that the smell generated by the film was far from sweet. Amazingly this film not only failed to garner an Oscar it failed to receive a single solitary nominationnot for Alexander Mackendrick's direction this abject failure truncating his promising career not for the incisive endlessly quotable screenplay Ernest Lehman  Clifford Odets not Elmer Bernstein's wonderful score nor the tremendous performances of Curtis and Lancasternot even James Wong Howe's gritty cinematography beautifully capturing the seamier side of New York City. Fortunately history has stepped in to provide a more accurate critique of this once ignored masterpiece. I can hardly wait to see it a second time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Make no mistake  you will not walk away from Sweet Smell of Success feeling uplifted and carefree.  It is a dark gritty tale of deception and the desperate strive for survival in New York City.  It also happens to be one of my alltime favorite films.Spoilers withinBurt Lancaster plays J.J. Hunsecker a powerful gossip columnist whose emulation of Walter Winchell was so thinly veiled that Winchell himself tried to stop the film's release.  Hunsecker is so powerful that underling press agents like Sidney Falco Tony Curtis will push aside any scruples or morals they may have in order to do him favors just to get a favorable mention for their clients in Hunsecker's column.  In Falco's case he must try to break up the relationship between Hunsecker's young sister Susan and upandcoming jazz musician Steve Dallas as Dallas is not worthy' in Hunsecker's eyes.

	onyx:emotionText "Make no mistake  you will not walk away from Sweet Smell of Success feeling uplifted and carefree.  It is a dark gritty tale of deception and the desperate strive for survival in New York City.  It also happens to be one of my alltime favorite films.Spoilers withinBurt Lancaster plays J.J. Hunsecker a powerful gossip columnist whose emulation of Walter Winchell was so thinly veiled that Winchell himself tried to stop the film's release.  Hunsecker is so powerful that underling press agents like Sidney Falco Tony Curtis will push aside any scruples or morals they may have in order to do him favors just to get a favorable mention for their clients in Hunsecker's column.  In Falco's case he must try to break up the relationship between Hunsecker's young sister Susan and upandcoming jazz musician Steve Dallas as Dallas is not worthy' in Hunsecker's eyes.  It becomes quickly apparent that due to an almost incestuous fascination with his sister no one will be worthy of her something that Susan has to come to terms with and finally resign herself to.

Lancaster captures not the mannerisms or speech patterns of Winchell but the sense of menace and terror the man held over anybody who wanted to be somebody in New York or the entertainment business. J.J. Hunsecker reminds me of a glowing radioactive ball of plutonium terrible in its simple existence. He can make or break you with a single word and everyone knows he can and will without a single look back. The film captures perfectly the smoky nightclub world of 21 and the Stork Club along with the grubby little burrow belonging to Sidney Falco press agent and repellent social climber. Great movie and by far Curtis's best performance.".

Go ahead and say it to  yourself and I'll say that David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross comes  close. Both feature snarling biting dialog. Both have irredeemable  characters that will do anything for success. Mamet's characters are  mostly downandouters who are scrapping at each other to find some  sampling of their former successes. In Sweet Smell of Success there are  successful characters and losers both of which need each other to  survive. It is a tale of a successful columnist and his need for a low  life press agent. It is a bitter bleak story of power success and the  desire to have more.  Burt Lancaster plays JJ Hunsecker a powerful successful columnist who  is at the top of his game. He gets what he wants when he wants it with  no questions asked. He can make or break celebrities with a quick blurb  in his column. He dines with politicians and gets any girl he wants.  Tony Curtis is Sidney Falco a low rent press agent who needs  Lancaster's blurbs for his clients to keep in business. Problem is  Hunsecker has cut Falco out of his columns because Falco hasn't  delivered on a deal they made. Though Hunsecker can garner the love and  admiration of anyone he chooses the one woman he cannot win over is  his own sister. As he repeatedly says throughout the film she's all he  has. Problem is she is in love with a jazz singer and they plan to  marry. Hunsecker can't bear the thought of losing his sister so he  forces Falco to get rid of the boy by any means necessary.  The film is relentless. From beginning to end it never stops its  pounding. There is never a breath of kindness. The two characters with  some redeeming characteristics Hunsecker's sister Susan Susan  Harrison and her boyfriend Steve Dallas Martin Milner are so  overshadowed by the continual foul play by Hunsecker and Falco that  they come away with a foul stench.  Tony Curtis pulls a performance that reminded me of his turn as the  Boston Strangler. It is not difficult to see his Falco turning to  murder if it helped him succeed. Though as the strangler he seems to  have found some remorse for his actions where Falco is irredeemable to  the very end.  There is a seen in the middle of the picture where Falco pulls a trick  to convince a mid level performer to make Falco his press agent. At  this point Falco needs all the clients he can get. Later the performer  comes to Falco ready to sign him as his agent. Falco now feeling some  signs of success brushes the performer off without a second thought. It  is a telling scene of just how heartless and uncaring Falco has become.  Where has Burt Lancaster been all my life? Sadly enough the only film  I can remember watching him in is the 1986 tossoff comedy Tough Guys.  His performance here is nothing short of astonishing. He is the king of  his castle never stepping off his high throne treating everyone as  servants. Even his shows of affection for Susan are grotesque and  menacing.  This is a story that his hard to watch. It is brutal and menacing with  nary a redeeming aspect. But it is a film that must be watched. The  craftsmanship of the filmmakers and the performances of the actors  elevate it above so many others. It is nearly a morality tale of the  horrors that befall humanities greed.".

The king of the thinking mans cinema. Has better dialogue ever been written the meetings between all the different characters that inhabit this world of shadows and intrigue constantly draw the viewers attention to this masterpiece.

That Marlon Brando De niro Nicholson and the like should be recognised so often in said lists when Burt Lancaster in this film and in so many others has equalled or surpassed there best performances is a real scandal. Perhaps because this film strikes at the very heart of the establishment and shows the media and press up for the unscrupulous scum they are that this is one those fellows would like to forget. It is always difficult to look the truth of oneself in the mirror and this is one mirror the media should look very closely at. A masterpiece from Lancaster who's courage never failed when making films and was always ready to tackle the kind of film making that lesser men would not have dared to not to mention casting himself in a bad guy role that defied his heroic handsome leading man status. Let us not forget that this is the same man who through out his life was never afraid to speak out on subjects that were important to him a life long liberal and contemptuous of anyone who excepted limitation. I love this film and both Lancaster and the picture were far ahead of their time.".

There is hardly a nongreedy guy in the movie although the three women are all okay.But here we have Burt Lancaster as the allpowerful columnist J. J. Hunsacker read Walter Winchell and Tony Curtis as the slimy press agent Sidney Falco and Emil Meyer as the brutal and corrupt cop supported by one columnist who cheats on his wife with a cigarette girl and another columnist who simply does the cigarette girl without cheating on any wife because he has none to cheat on. These are people who treat virtue with scant reverence.There's a loud jazzy score to back up this energetic nighttime flick. There is no such thing as daylight here. And Clifford Odets has lent his usual stamp to the script. Nobody says anything as simple as I don't believe you. They are made to say That fish is four days old. I won't buy it. And the sweating laughaminute cop is given to misusing big words  Rectify me something Sidney did J. J. really say I was fat? Even when the cop uses the word correctly it still SOUNDS wrong  Ha ha! Come back Sidney I want to CHASTISE you. The dialog is also studded with everyday phrases that are repeated as if part of a litany  credit where credit is due. And indulge me on this and correct me if I'm wrong. The best of this dialog is given to the evildoers meaning every guy except Curtis's uncle Sam Levene underused in my opinion and Martin Milner as an innocent young jazz guitarist afloat in this sea of sharks. You twist words around he says addressing another actor not Odets. This movie is by the way some considerable distance from the director's Alexander MacKendrick usual stomping ground. Cf. Tight Little Island.Burt Lancaster gives a quiet barely restrained performance as the gossip columnist and TV personality who tells presidents what to do. He's so tense with ego power anger and an incestuous jealousy of any attention paid to his sister that he gives the impression of a boil about to burst. But he rarely loses it. Instead if he shows any semblance of emotion at all it's usually pleasure in the exercise of power accompanied by a reptilian almost alligatorlike smile of beneficence. It's a good performance and so is Tony Curtis's. Nattily dressed in black suits his hair flawlessly groomed his expression alternating between a phony bonhomie and greasy anxiety he seems always to be in motion darting rather than walking and talking almost always usually lying. Barbara Nichols as the careless and exploited cigarette girl plays Barbara Nichols. I have no idea what she was like in person but on screen she's never been anyone else. And as someone once remarked about the adolescent AnnMargaret  Everything she does comes across as dirty. Martin Milner looks right but mumbles his way through the part without much conviction. Burt's sister is a washout.What a splendid photographer James Wong Howe was. His blacks are really black his highlights seem to glisten and when Lancaster's mogul stands on his balcony staring down at his domain from on high the streets of New York look like rivulets of glittering silver poured from a beaker. Compare this with the subtle crisp grays of his Texas ranch in Hud.The movie gives us a glimpse of the sizzling New York City night life of the 1950s. It may have looked corrupt at the time but from our present perspective it was an age of innocence. Welldressed people walk alone down deserted streets at night. You want to try that in today's New York? Maybe the greatest change since then is suggested by the puissance in the hands of a newspaper columnist  a guy who writes words that people must then read. Read? Who gets their news from newspapers nowadays? Who would be shocked by the revelations Lancaster and his colleagues in gossip come up with  an unknown musician who is said to have smoked marijuana and is fired because of the slur? Today it would lead to hemorrhageinducing mirth. So it might have been rotten then true but there are times when it seems to me that it would be nice to listen to the hoof beats of yesteryear and travel back in time to a period when people still read and when one of the worst lies you might run into in the news was that a musician did some grass.".

The sense of location and period is really strong  sleazy and vibrant.Sadly the characterisation is a letdown.

Confusing. And he starts off sleazy carries on being sleazy and gets a bit of cheap redemption in the end. He is the main character so everything flows from that and it's all a bit off.The other problem is the highly mannered dialogue  hard bitten sometimes obscure never believable. The actors do deliver it well but I ain't buying it. The columnist is an interesting character but the lovers are pretty plain and in the end we just get a jerky old melodrama with nothing true about it.The one part I did enjoy was the subplot with the stage comedian where the hero's nerve and trickery shone through. So although impressed with the atmospherics I was left cold by the rest of the story.My guess is this movie's reputation really rests on the surprise of Lancaster's performance. Overall big production built on a flawed screenplay.ps. I've read the screenwriter was drafted in very late and ended up ripping fresh pages out of his typewriter on shooting days.

	schema:headline " Stylish film about the corruption of the press";
	schema:reviewBody "Burt Lancaster is a ruthless newspaper columnist J.J. Hunsecker and Tony Curtis is press agent Sidney Falco who needs his clients featured in Hunsecker's column. The film starts with Falco trying to get in touch with Hunsecker who has refused to feature any news about Falco's clients for the past month. As a result Falco's clients are upsetting and firing him left and right. He needs to get back in Hunsecker's good graces. It turns out that Hunsecker wanted Falco to break up the romance between his sister Susan Hunsecker and Steve Dallas a local jazz musician. Falco failed in his first attempt to break them up thus Hunsecker is punishing him. Hunsecker gives Falco one more chance to break up Susan and Dallas. Falco decides to plant a false rumor in a competing column as a means to hurt Dallas' reputation. Then Hunsecker will defend Dallas in his column in which Dallas will dismiss Hunsecker's attempts to smooth things over and in effect he will look bad to girlfriend Susan. That's the plan anyway... First thing. I loved the music in this movie. It was great rowdy raunchy jazz music that I love and it fit the aesthetic and the mood of the film perfectly. I also loved the cinematography in this film. I thought the black and white looked great. I also liked how some characters would be presented in an extreme closeup but also at an angle. There's a shot like this of Falco in the beginning. I think it is supposed to symbolize this character's corruption and uneasiness. Extreme closeups can be somewhat uncomfortable for the audience at least for me anyway it almost seems a bit claustrophobic if that makes sense. I also loved the New York settings. In addition to the music and camera work I thought Curtis and Lancaster were excellent in their roles. While I didn't dig Lancaster's crew cut I thought it worked well for his character who seems like he's pretty much all business all the time. He kind of had a Hank Hill thing going on in this moviebut of course he's smarter and more shrewd than Hank Hill could ever be. I also really liked Curtis in this movie. Before I kind of dismissed him as a big of a lightweight actor though I do really like him in Some Like it Hot but this film demonstrated that he was adept at drama. I thought he was great as Falco the agent who would stop at nothing to be successful. I didn't care much for the actress who played Susan. She wasn't bad but I didn't like how she talked. She over enunciated her words. I thought this was a great film.".

Lancaster gives one of the best performances of his career as J.J.

Tony Curtis plays slimy loser Sidney Falco who desperately wants to be somebody and jumps to J.J.'s commands like a circus animal. Together these two prowl the grimy shadowy streets of a nightmare version of the Big Apple creating a vision more steeped in film noir than the most noirish detective movie. Accusations of Communist sympathies are made while Hunsecker reveals an unnatural fondness for his sister. All of this is set to a discordant and jazzy score that's like the aural version of neon signs.You could fill a book with the quotable lines from this film. My favorite.....That fish is four days old and I ain't buyin' it. Or the ever classic I'd hate to take a bite out of you. You're a cookie full of arsenic.

I said that there's no real protagonist but Sidney fits the role as someone we associate and sympathize with and the question we explore is how low Sidney will sink in this Faustian tale.

	schema:reviewBody "This film hits the ground and doesn't stop or ever look back. We are transported to a dark shadowy marginal world living on the outskirts of polite society. We see the creatures that populate this dark aberration of society polite or otherwise.One of the creatures inhabiting this Eco system is Press Agent Sidney Falco Tony Curtis. Immediately we see him as a manic personality living in the bars and clubs all around the Broadway Theatrical District. He is ever running telephoning or kibitzing with clients and potential clients. His small sort of shabby office has a bedroom set up in order for him to crash or whatever else requires the use of a bed.As it seems obvious he apparently also lives there. Sidney needs to stay in the good graces of the big newspaper columnists like the top guy J.J. Hunsecker Burt Lancester. It is columnists like him who use the little items in their columns which they receive from the Press Agents. The more items from Sidney the greater is his asking price from clients.Mr. Hunsecker has acquired more power over those in the entertainment field than one could believe. He holds figurative powers of life and death over the various numbers of actors singers dancers musicians and comedians. A good word from his column is viewed as a blessing by any producer as a panning o the very same show would hurt it grievously.However as we soon see his megalomania is not limited to his show biz reporting and gossip in the printed page. He has a young sister Susan Susan Hucksetter of whom he maintains an iron grip on her life having a compulsion to protect her from any outside influences be the business or social.When Susan falls for musician Steve Dallas Martin Milner J.J. pulls out all stops in attempting to break up the young couple. He has a direct meeting where he insinuates that it would not be good his career if he didn't break off the relationship. Things didn't work out with that little chat so J.J. gave the job of discrediting Steve to Sidney Falco once again.The finale features the use of a crooked and brutal Police Lieutenant and the use of planting false evidence. Much like MOBY DICK the story ends with a lot still going on a sure indication that the author believes there to be no relief from such situations.The story is woven in such a manner as to never seem to be to long or to be dragging. The Director and cinematographer Alexander Mackendrick and James Wong Howe respectively gave the film a real upclose and personal feel to it. They make the viewer surrender himself and accept all sorts of bizarre behaviour.There has been many a claim that the Story and Character of J.J. Hudsecker while fictional and emphatically so stated is really based on Walter Winchell who was topdog in the Broadway  Show Biz Columnist business. Others have pointed to Alexander Woollcott. Our guess is that the author used bits and pieces of many real life folks as well as blending in a heaping portion of embellishment for good measure.Our Recommendation Definitely see it. Just make sure you're in the proper frame of mind as the overall mood of the film is a definitely a downer.".

Rather than return home Tom decides to embark on the historical pilgrimage to honor his son's desire to finish the journey. What Tom doesn't plan on is the profound impact the journey will have on him and his California Bubble Life. Inexperienced as a trekker Tom soon discovers that he will not be alone on this journey.

I did a part of the camino in 2009 and It was a life changingenhancing experience for me so I couldn't wait to see how the film would deal with it. Yesterday I saw the film in the Screen cinema in College Green Dublin. The film is in my opinion very true to the camino experience. A previous reviewer trivialised it as a road movie and suggested wizard of Oz characterisation. The camino road has been travelled for over a thousand years. Long before road movies were even thought about and yes any story of fellow travellers sharing their stories on a journey can be similar to the wizard of Oz but I think Chaucers Canterbury Tales is probably the true origin of the species. The camino de Santiago in its reality and in this film is a wonderful kaleidoscopic confluence of humanity. Pilgrims seem to selfselect for certain character traits such as eccentricity other worldliness joyfullness adventurousness hurt curiosity etc. Tom's companions were all from the palette of characters I found on the camino. Tom himself was an accidental pilgrim and only at the end of the camino did he allow himself to fall in love with it like the others. Tom the cynical skeptic driven to put one foot in front of another as a way of dealing with the brokenness of his relationship with his son and the trauma of his sudden death allows the distance required to allow viewers share in the journey of the Camino in a way that could not have been achieved by following four ordinary pilgrims no matter how colourful. Tom was the straight man the foil that allowed the full colours of all the other characters to shine through. I thought it was a brilliant piece of cinema. Ole!".

I think this will go down as one of Martin Sheen's best ever performances. He underplays his role due to Emilio's direction? which makes it all the stronger. In fact it's the understated quality of the whole film that makes it very moving. It never descends into sentimentality but you still feel the grief of Martin Sheen's character as he makes the pilgrimage his estranged dead son never completed. At the same time there are a lot of funny moments which lift it from becoming a depressing journey. The gradual coalescing of the four very different main characters into a unified group works very well. Each of them has a different reason for making the pilgrimage and to begin with they seem to have nothing in common but it's still very believable when they start to relate to each other. Emilio and his father Martin have every reason to be very proud of this film. It works on every level.".

Very touching. I cried twice and laughed and towards the end was sitting with a huge grin on my face. The warmth between the characters was good honest authentic.It's also like having plans to do one thing but you end up doing something quite different that just grows. I could feel a loosening at the end of it where feelings had shifted for people there was a release for the characters that had happened in a very real way. Nothing grated it was very gentle but built up to a wave that carried me with it.Scenery is beautiful of course. An interesting bit with the gypsies in Spain that I found challenging. It brought me up as I believed the same stuff they assumed  I'd heard it so much and it is interesting when I realised that what I've accepted as truth may just be prejudice. We all like a scapegoat to absolve ourselves and to feel superior to other folks.Well done everyone involved with this. I think I will be buying a few copies of this to hand out.It makes me want to go but it kind of makes me want to go alone to see who I meet on the way.".

They all worked so well together and by the end of the movie you could see they spent a lot of time together on the set and honestly got along or so it seemed and thats what made the movie impressive. Wonderful movie to watch with an uplifting vibe and quirky characters with a real bond make this a definite must see.

	schema:headline " Martin Sheen walks 500 miles in northern Spain and it is a pleasure to watch every single one";
	schema:reviewBody "Everyone has their own personal reason for choosing to walk the real 500 mile Camino de Santiago. This is a trail which begins in France winds its way through the French Pyrenees across northern Spain's Basque region and ends in Galicia at the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. Legend says St. James is buried here. Every year thousands of 'pilgrims' make this arduous trek which can take months to accomplish. However don't let the word pilgrim fool you many people undertake this quest for nonreligious reasons.In fact four such folk are the main characters in The Way. Tom Martin Sheen is a native Californian eye doctor who spends as much time on the links as he does at the office. He receives an unexpected phone call from a French policeman informing him his son Daniel Emilio Estevez died in southern France in a major storm. Tom flies out to France to collect his body and learns about the pilgrimage Daniel was just starting out on.Tom and Daniel did not have the best parting one would like to have the last time you are going to see your son. Tom thought Daniel was wasting his life on these silly adventures while Daniel responded with the platitude You don't choose your life you experience it. In a moment of remorse and homage Tom decides to walk the 500 miles for Daniel with his cremated remains spreading his ashes along the way.Quickly he is joined by fellow pilgrims each with their own reasons for taking a few months out of their lives to backpack across Spain. There is the Dutchman Joost Yorick van Wageningen who is walking the trail to lose weight for his brother's wedding. Sarah Deborah Kara Unger is a chain smoking Canadian who vows to drop the habit once she reaches the cathedral and Jack James Nesbitt is an Irishman convinced the trail will finally crack his writer's block. Initially Tom does not particularly want their company because he is suffering from some severe guilt and remorse about Daniel. This leads to the film's low point of a drunken rage against pilgrims and his walking mates. Fortunately once this ridiculous and needless scene is over the rest of The Way is a very enjoyable movie to watch.The Way was shot with only available light sunlight during the day and candles and fire at night which lends it a great deal of authenticity. Other than the main characters everyone else on screen are actual pilgrims walking the trail to the cathedral. There is a scene later on with real Roma Gypsies. Since the Camino de Santiago means a great deal to many people especially those in northern Spain you can really see how writerdirector Emilio Estevez took his time to do this right.It is refreshing to see Emilio pop his head up once again for some work. I last saw him when he directed 2006's Bobby and since then it appears he has only directed a couple episodes of Numb3rs. Perhaps he is always waiting for some real inspiration to use as his next project. He mentioned The Way came about from his father and his son's experience on the trail. I wonder if the character Jack is a model for Emilio since the first draft of this screenplay took six months to write. Furthermore it is about time Martin Sheen showed up in a good movie again. Recently he has had some bit parts in throw away movies such as Love Happens and Imagine That and hasn't truly had quality work since The Departed.The Way won't win any awards however it is so positive and perhaps intentionally persuasive that I bet every person in the audience thought about how they could find a few months to take off and hike that distance. I had no idea that such a place as the Camino de Santiago existed before watching The Way which I suspect is a big reason why Emilio Estevez took the time to write and direct this film. He wants the rest of us to know about it as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "This carefully written road movie drama was directed by Emilio Estevez who used traditional footage and laid out the story over a compelling soundtrack with artists such as Tyler Bates James Taylor and Nick Drake. In brief we're following Martin Sheen's character Tom during his pilgrimage journey whilst mourning his dead son who died on the same pilgrim route after only one day. Tom meets people along the way who also become his friends although Tom himself is uninviting. In contrast to the other characters Tom develops throughout the film and goes through the various stages of mourning that come with a great loss such as he suffered. Except from the usual message that people spend too little time reflecting over their life's I think The Way makes a good job of describing the strong bond between father and son and at the same time highlight some problems with that relationship. Some scenes are obviously there to hammer in those two messages and the film would have been even better had they been made more subtle. I do recommend watching this film and I think it shows that Emilio Estevez' directing skills don't just pertain to Bobby.".

The last formal film he appeared in was Rated X with his brother Charlie Sheen in 2000. Finally we see Emilio's talents not only behind the camera but in writing as well. He handles the screenplay the directing and the producing in this beautifully crafted film.You can tell just from the closetohome feel of the character The Way is something sentimental and meaningful to both Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Both real life father and son actors have been taking most of their time in 2011 and using it to promote a film with heart and soul but will likely be ignored when in theaters because of its very limited release and its minimal marketing.The story focuses on Tom Sheen an American doctor who goes to France after hearing his adventureseeking son Daniel Estevez has died in a storm while hiking the Camino de Santiago  a famed Christian route many walk on to find faith or go to Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela at the end of the fivehundred mile route.After arriving in France to pick up Daniel's ashes Tom makes a splitsecond decision that he will follow hike the path of his son while spreading his ashes throughout the trail. He meets up with many different people with many different stories. They are Joost Wageningen a Dutchman who is hiking the trail for exercise purposes Sarah Unger who is trying to quit smoking and Jack from Ireland Nesbitt who is suffering from writer's block and is trying to collect information about fellow hikers and their separate journeys.The Way has a number of strange qualities  for one it has noticeable parallels to the 1939 classic The Wizard of Oz. And two it is odd for Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez two actors that practice in strict Catholicism to focus on a film that leads to a Christian Cathedral. Whatever the reason behind it the story is pitchperfect and Martin Sheen may have just given one of the best performances of his career.The tears come and go in The Way but so do the shocker scenes like when the topic of abortion is briefly mentioned. It is rare for such a film to bring up a controversial topic which is why The Way deserves a load of credit.The plot isn't too deep but the story is truly moving. The acting by the four characters is fantastic and like any road movie it is more about the characters getting to find their innerselves rather than walking from point a to point b. Only here  it is more welcomed because of the fact that is what the Camino de Santiago is all about.Starring Martin Sheen Deborah Kara Unger James Nesbitt Yorick van Wageningen and Emilio Estevez. Directed by Emilio Estevez.".

	schema:headline " My faith is being restored in cinema.";
	schema:reviewBody "At a time in my life when I have been growing quite cynical about the future of cinema and film making 3 movies this year have worked to restore my faith in our ability to make great movies and I hope they portend a glimpse into the future of this my favorite art form. In recent months I've been treated to not just one but three deeply moving film treats. 127 Hours The Kings Speech and this movie The Way which is my favorite of all. These movies are all powerful and dense in content and emotion without the use of gratuitous sex or violence. They are adult real frank and thought provoking without being twisted or gross.These are three completely different movies from three different directors and with very different subject matter. Their only common thread is that they are simply good. Very good. Films like these are the reason I fell in love with the movies so very many years ago. The one which zeroed in on my individual heart though even among these three great films was The Way.There are plenty of great reviews here about the specifics of the film and I encourage you to read enough of them to pump you up to see it but don't try to find out too much about the movie. How it unfolds etc.. The movie itself can be a mini pilgrimage. Just go knowing you will enjoy it more than Twilight Part X and let your self be vulnerable to this beautiful movie.This film is a chance for you to have a 2 hour minipilgrimage of your own. To reflect on your own journey in life whatever form that it taking. To suffer die and be reborn in a brief afternoon at your local multiplex and to give a knowing smile and wink from time to time and to laugh as well. In short this masterpiece by Emilio Estevez takes you skillfully through all the stages that happen on real pilgrimage. It's brilliant on every level. It's writing cuts straight to the heart. The editing is perfect the cinematography gorgeous and the characters are extraordinarily real whether they make you cringe or want to give them a hug or both which is usually the case with not only these characters but all the real people we meet in our lives. This is us in miniature. All of us. Captured by a master craftsman.I'll actually be hurt if the academy doesn't recognize this truly amazing film. I'm not sure if it fits the typical Oscar M.O. but if it doesn't then the academy is blind. I want this film to do very well in all regards. It's what we need in Hollywood. It's time. We've done enough of the same old thing to last us a life time. How about a steady stream of gems and genuine works of personal love such as this being offered on many more screens than CGI sterility and vampire soap operas.This is one to savor and let it have it's way with you emotionally. There was literally not a dry eye in the sadly underpopulated theater my wife and I went to. One of only two screens in this city of hundreds to be showing the best movie out right now hands down.".

	onyx:emotionText "At a time in my life when I have been growing quite cynical about the future of cinema and film making 3 movies this year have worked to restore my faith in our ability to make great movies and I hope they portend a glimpse into the future of this my favorite art form. In recent months I've been treated to not just one but three deeply moving film treats. 127 Hours The Kings Speech and this movie The Way which is my favorite of all. These movies are all powerful and dense in content and emotion without the use of gratuitous sex or violence. They are adult real frank and thought provoking without being twisted or gross.These are three completely different movies from three different directors and with very different subject matter. Their only common thread is that they are simply good. Very good. Films like these are the reason I fell in love with the movies so very many years ago. The one which zeroed in on my individual heart though even among these three great films was The Way.There are plenty of great reviews here about the specifics of the film and I encourage you to read enough of them to pump you up to see it but don't try to find out too much about the movie. How it unfolds etc.. The movie itself can be a mini pilgrimage. Just go knowing you will enjoy it more than Twilight Part X and let your self be vulnerable to this beautiful movie.This film is a chance for you to have a 2 hour minipilgrimage of your own. To reflect on your own journey in life whatever form that it taking. To suffer die and be reborn in a brief afternoon at your local multiplex and to give a knowing smile and wink from time to time and to laugh as well. In short this masterpiece by Emilio Estevez takes you skillfully through all the stages that happen on real pilgrimage. It's brilliant on every level. It's writing cuts straight to the heart. The editing is perfect the cinematography gorgeous and the characters are extraordinarily real whether they make you cringe or want to give them a hug or both which is usually the case with not only these characters but all the real people we meet in our lives.

Beautiful views of mountains magnificent landscape of old towns in Spain and France. Especially the old buildings in Burgos were beautifully filmed by the filmmakers. And because of that I'm pretty sure this movie makes many audience want to travel there just like I did.Not only about the scenery but also the plot was decent in this film. A father lost his son tried to understand his son through the pilgrimage. Even as a not religious person I'm Japanese I could simply enjoyed the movie and the main topic of the movie true meaning of the pilgrimage was very clear to me in the last 10 min of the film.Do I recommend this to my friends? definitely yes! Does it worth to rent ? absolutely yes! Does it worth to purchase it? yes yes YES!!! If you want to watch some car chase and gun shooting go rent another one.

	schema:reviewBody "I like nothing more than when you see a movie that you only have meagre expectations of maybe you'd heard of it or seen a trailer but don't know what to expect and then WHAM it blows you away. That is exactly what happened with Emilio Estevez's The Way. The movie is not your typical Hollywood blockbuster. It isn't fast paced it isn't full of action or riveting moments. Instead it is simple heart felt subtle and completely and utterly beautiful. Your emotions will just run high and while the movie has this dark undertone of sadness and grief the beauty and the spirit of the journey will lift you up and make you want to experience this again and again. I haven't seen a movie that made me feel this way in such a long time. The stunning scenery is only small part of this film but what a beautiful countryside this rag tag group of pilgrims experience. Its a story about four people from different walks of life on the same walk to experience something...anything...and you will walk with them step by step.Martin Sheen is a Hollywood icon and a terrific actor but this is probably his best role in years. Sheen gives a powerhouse performance that just makes you love and feel for this father looking desperately to find a son he's lost but also a piece of himself. Sheen is riveting and this was an award worthy performance. Yorick van Wageningen is Sheen's first companion that he meets. A dutch man who on the surface is walking The Way for his weight but you will learn much more about him. He seems a bizarre match to Sheen but they work well together and he is a lot of fun and adds a smile to the film. Deborah Kara Unger is the jaded and angry Canadian girl she really is Canadian! She adds a definitive flare to the cast with her sarcasm and biting wit but has perhaps the most to take from the journey. James Nesbitt is perhaps the least developed of the characters as he comes on late in the movie but he is still an important part of the cast and he is terrific. Nesbitt's character most importantly gets Sheen to finally open up about his son. Writer director and creator of the film Emilio Estevez plays the small role of Sheen's son. It is significant though because I think the intensity of the emotions Sheen displays is increased by the fact that Estevez is actually his son.Estevez really blew me away with his previous project Bobby. I've come to the conclusion that when Estevez cares about a project he puts every ounce of his soul into the film. The Way demonstrates what kind of passion he puts into his film. It is just beautiful in every sense of the word. The Spanish countryside is stunning the shots he uses of all of them together walking the trail and the relationship he creates between these four strangers who are completely different. I felt on the verge of tears through the whole film but not just because it is sad because there are scenes of sadness but just how heart felt and honest and passionate this movie is. Please see this beautiful and simple drama because it is magnificent. 1010".

Enchanting is but one way to describe it. What a wonderful journey which comes fullcircle under difficult circumstances. This movie will make many want to walk The Way themselves after watching it kudos to Emilio Estevez for finding such a great story then doing such a bangup job directingfilming it. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!";

I've been a fan of Emilio's and Martin's for a very long time though I think this was the first time I'd seen them in the same film together.The film takes you on a journey and boy do you feel like you've been on one by the end of film. And by the end of the this film I was left thinking that for my 40th or 50th Birthday I'm certainly thinking of doing this pilgrimage myself.I had been wanting to see the film since that first time and gratefully BBC Two premiered the film just the other day and watching it again I still find myself inspired to do this. Lets hope when I turn 40 or 50 I still want to do this!".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie tells the tale of four pilgrims hiking across northern Spain on The Way of St James. The path takes them from Roncesvaux to Santiago de Compostela.The story is centered on Tom played by Martin Sheen. Tom went to Spain to identify and repatriate the body of his son Daniel played by reallife son Emilio Estevez who had died on the pilgrimage in an accident.Stricken by grief Tom decides to have his son cremated in Spain and  at the spur of the moment and without training  to complete the 800 km pilgrimage with his son's remains. Along the way he deposits the ashes of his son at significant points thus helping his son to complete this journey in spirit and helping himself to say goodbye to Daniel.Tom is a ophthalmologist from California with a comfortable life and a limited world view. During his act of paternal devotion he slowly learns from the example of his son that life is a journey and there is a world out there to be explored and new people to meet. As happens on such journeys he picks up three unlikely companions Canadian Sarah Dutchman Joost and Irishman Jack. Each is making the pilgrimage for various personal reasons but we are left to wonder about their faith. The religious aspect is dealt with in the movie but in a quiet understated way.Along the way Tom and the moviegoer also discover the countryside and people of northern Spain but particularly what it is like to do this pilgrimage. Interest in this hiking route has increased over the last 25 years. Very few hiked El Camino in 1987 but over 150000 did it last year. Most of us who crave adventure and travel have thought about doing it.This fine intelligent and understated movie spoke to me on several levels. It is a beautiful important and moving film.".

	schema:reviewBody "A tip of the cap to directorwriter Emilio Estevez for this one. He treats faith and spirituality with refreshing respect even though he plays it a bit too safe for my taste. This is a story about a father coming to grips with the loss of his son and does so honoring his memory on a famous pilgrimage the El camino de Santiago in Spain. It's a slowly developing character piece that simply involves pilgrims walking while seeking something along the way. The first half of the film suffers from the attempt to separate spirituality from religion. Nothing moving or profound happens during the first half of the journey. We get walking LOTS of walking but we also get to know the characters and are rewarded for doing so because the last half of the film really does shine. The varied motivations of his fellow pilgrims all come in to play and nothing really is what it seems with each person on the surface. Faith and purpose means different things to different people and the movie does explore that but does so with the lightest touch possible. There's no preaching or heavyhanded sermon stuff anywhere in site. It certainly is more broadly spiritual than specifically religious. It's a slow paced and ultimately light take on both spirituality and religion because it does play it safe. Audiences of faith will find it warm reverent and congenial but not as truly satisfying because of the cautious approach. Sheen's character is a professed lapsed Catholic but it's good to see those aspects dealt with in a meaningful and emotional manner. Some aspects of his faith are seen on the journey and certainly during the climactic scene at the shrine itself. As a Catholic I appreciated the little gestures others may not and especially the influence that St. James' shrine exerted on Sheen's character. Overall this is a wonderful character movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This brilliant minimalist film directed by the estimable Ulrich Weiss was made in East Berlin in 1980 and tells the story of Arnold Clasen Uwe Kockisch a communist and a member of a small antifascist underground cell resisting Hitler with what little resources its members have. All around Clasen and his comrades other communist groups have already been rounded up and sent to concentration camps. Countless thousands eventually died there a fact we seldom hear much about.The film is moody stark expressionistic and filled with looming dread. Shadows conflict constantly with light dingy sinister streets are populated by wary people and we wonder who the Nazis will scoop up next.The arresting thing about this film is that it is void of violence there is nary a drop of blood to be seen no bombedout buildings no prolonged vicious Hollywoodstyle gunfights how refreshing is THAT? Yet at the same time the film teems with suspense. There is malice forever lurking in the background and it is psychologically disturbing. You know one member of the communist cell is a deeply troubled Gestapo agent who desperately wants to escape his fate. There is also an allpowerful Nazi machine impossible to oppose. Like Kafka's hapless 'heroes' there is little to be done to oppose these faceless 'presences' one just waits until 'they' come to get you.This is not a 'war' movie but instead a study in desperate claustrophobia. Its lead actor Uwe Kockisch is outstanding as the deerinheadlights man driven to despair by paranoia and fear. He leads an outstanding ensemble of actors.'Your Unknown Brother' was invited to Cannes in 1981 but the East German government intervened and disallowed it. A pity. This is a special kind of film unique and powerfully refreshing despite its disturbing subject matter.".

You know one member of the communist cell is a deeply troubled Gestapo agent who desperately wants to escape his fate. There is also an allpowerful Nazi machine impossible to oppose. Like Kafka's hapless 'heroes' there is little to be done to oppose these faceless 'presences' one just waits until 'they' come to get you.This is not a 'war' movie but instead a study in desperate claustrophobia. Its lead actor Uwe Kockisch is outstanding as the deerinheadlights man driven to despair by paranoia and fear. He leads an outstanding ensemble of actors.'Your Unknown Brother' was invited to Cannes in 1981 but the East German government intervened and disallowed it. A pity. This is a special kind of film unique and powerfully refreshing despite its disturbing subject matter.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit that I had trouble with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball in the leads largely because they both were really too old to play their respective characters Ball was about 57 at the time and Fonda about 63.  In the end the film is so well done that I forgot about that.  Aside from the film Please Don't Eat the Daisies this is probably the best family movie of the 60's. The best thing about the film is the realistic way in which the family blends together.  The usual problems are all there and the way in which Fonda and Ball deal with it is about what one would expect a certain amount of good intentions a bit of mistake making sacrifice and providing a good deal of love and support. The writing may not be politically correct in this day and age the scene where Fonda's kids get Ball drunk Ball spanks one of the boys and there is also a certain amount of gender stereotyping but it is this that gives the film its appeal and relatability. As Leonard Maltin points out look for a some well known faces in the supporting cast.  Tom Bosley as the doctor Tim Matheson as Mike a four or five year old Tracey Nelson Morgan Brittany of Dallas fame 70's TV staple Ben Murphy as the oldest daughter's boyfriend and well known child actor Eric Shea who gives an endearing performance as young Philip the kid that seems the most lost in the big family. All in all Dad Fonda sums the whole thing up when he describes for the oldest daughter who's being pressured by the boyfriend to have sex what love is really about and how this family is staying together It isn't going to bed with a man that proves that you love him it's getting up in the morning and facing the drab miserable wonderful everyday world that counts. I suppose having 19 kids is carrying it a bit too far but if we had it to do all over again who would we skip you?  And that is exactly what Helen and Frank are doing together and the kids admire and respect them all the more for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yours Mine And Ours is one of the best family films of the 1960s. Very loosely based on the reallife story of Helen North a Navy widow with eight children who married Navy career man Frank Beardsley a widower with ten children of his own. Lucille Ball bought the rights to Mrs. Beardsley's book Who Gets The Drumstick? co produced it and took the starring role of Helen North. For those who know her chiefly as a comedienne this film will be a pleasant surprise. For not only does she have the opportunity to indulge in some of the slapstick she is famous for she proves conclusively that she was an excellent dramatic actress as well. Moreover she can switch abruptly and seemingly effortlessly from comedy to pathos sometimes in the same scene! Henry Fonda takes the part of Frank Beardsley and gives it both dimension and strength. As his bachelor friend Van Johnson is a welcome presence as is Tom Bosley as a sardonic doctor. There is also a hilarious performance from Louise Troy as Frank's date early in the story. The kids are well cast and include future notables Tim Matheson Suzanne Cupito who grew up to be Morgan Brittany Mitch Vogel and Tracy Nelson. A good deal of the plot involves the mutual dislike most of the kids have for their stepsiblings but a great deal of charm is present as well. Aiding the production is a nice score by Fred Karlin a lovely song It's A Sometimes World and handsome San Francisco location photography. A remake has just been completed and will be released around the holiday season but it's not likely to top this one. Incidentally if you read the original book by Helen Beardsley you will most likely come away with a far different picture of the Beardsley family one which may not have transferred as well to the screen. This may also explain why there is no mention of the book as the story source in the movie's opening credits.".

I always thought he would go on to be a real big movie star instead of TV movies since he had lots of charisma and maturity at that young age.  However he has done very well in the roles on television he has played and is always a real treat to watch.  I don't think I thought Lucille Ball was too old the first time I saw it because anyone over 25 seemed old to me at the time!  I recently caught this movie on TV and enjoyed it again from an adult perspective. It was a little corny but still a good film.  Life in the sixties even with Vietnam and all was a much more innocent time especially with what kids face today.  I would give it a 100 just because it is so uplifting.".

Helen North Lucy is a widow with 8 kids and Frank Beardsley Fondais a navy captain with 10.  They fall in love and of course bedlam ensues as they try to unite two families.  Oh boy!!! Battling stepsiblings arguments over who gets which bedroom resentments toward the new stepparents etc.  It ends happily though with the family pulling together to welcome the new baby 19! and learning to love and live together as a happy family.Lucy plays her role with wonderful motherly warmth.  You can actually see the love she has for each of those children and her deep desire to have her new stepchildren love her.  However  she does treat us to some delightful Lucyish antics.  The scene in a crowded bar involving a wandering false eyelash and an uncooperative dress are absolutely classic  exactly the kind of comedy Lucy can do like no one else.  And yet these antics DO NOT dominate her performance or the film.  They are just little treats thrown in every so often.  Watch her expression in the next to last scene when Fonda's children tell her that she has been adoptedas our mother for life.  Henry Fonda brings a nice crisp authority to his role  it would have been easy to have made this man a caricature.  A scene towards the end where Lucy's oldest daughter turns to him for comfort and advice after dumping her oily boyfriend is lovely.  Van Johnson has some good lines as Fonda's best friend.  The kids are all very well cast and included some stars to be  Tim Matheson Tracy Nelson she's one of the very youngest kids Morgan Brittany billed as Suzanne Cupito and Eric Shea better known as the Robin in POSEIDON ADVENTURE.In all a heartwarming film with a strong emphasis on life second chances and a very positive spin on beauty and bond of family love.".

Taking chances was Lucy's forte starring in a TV show I Love Lucy and insisting on the casting of her husband Desi Arnaz and her also equally famous decisions authorize the productions of Star Trek and Mission Impossible against the recommendations of the Desilu Board of Directors. Ball's last great accomplishment as a CEO was the insistence of filming Yours Mine and Ours as a theatrical movie hoping to make Desilu a force in film production as well. Make no doubt about it if one re reads the story that Rex Reed wrote in the New York Times on Lucy while she was filming this movie Ms. Ball ran the show and event titled his great article on Lucy  I Run My Studio Like I Run My Home.Lucille Balllooking youthful and beautiful is superb in the title role of Helen Beardsley and her nuanced performance should have garnered Lucille Ball a long sought after Oscar nomination. Ms. Ball is at times both funny and in a departure from her TV Lucy quite soft and underplays many scenes. Henry Fonda is a perfect Mr. Beardsley. Van Johnson a pal from Lucy's old MGM days is cast and gets a nice role supporting both Stars. Many were surprised by the success of this film. I have no idea why. It is a fine and lasting comedy classic directed by the sure hand of the fine Melville Shavelson.".

Ball's last great accomplishment as a CEO was the insistence of filming Yours Mine and Ours as a theatrical movie hoping to make Desilu a force in film production as well. Make no doubt about it if one re reads the story that Rex Reed wrote in the New York Times on Lucy while she was filming this movie Ms. Ball ran the show and event titled his great article on Lucy  I Run My Studio Like I Run My Home.Lucille Balllooking youthful and beautiful is superb in the title role of Helen Beardsley and her nuanced performance should have garnered Lucille Ball a long sought after Oscar nomination. Ms. Ball is at times both funny and in a departure from her TV Lucy quite soft and underplays many scenes. Henry Fonda is a perfect Mr. Beardsley. Van Johnson a pal from Lucy's old MGM days is cast and gets a nice role supporting both Stars. Many were surprised by the success of this film. I have no idea why. It is a fine and lasting comedy classic directed by the sure hand of the fine Melville Shavelson.";

One year later Florence Henderson was to reprise the same role in the Brady Bunch TV series. This movie has it over the Bradys hands down.  When all of the kids that belonged to Henry Fonda's character met Lucille Balls' character for the first time they got her drunk.  Would never happen on the Brady Bunch.  And all those kids!  I think it was either 19 or 20!  Much more responsibility in this combined household.  Don't forget shopping day with the caravan of shopping carts I'm surprised collateral didn't have to be put up for the groceries.  The idea here is that the sheer enormity of this situation makes it so hilarious along with all the petty jealousies and conflicts inherent in all families creates a movie that viewers can relate to on several levels.  You don't need to have 20 kids to appreciate the film.  The Brady Bunch seemed too perfect.  The Norths and the Beardsleys had to put some tough love and effort into this to make it work and this is reflected in Yours Mine and Ours.  See it just for the fun of it.  Look for Tom Bosley Howard Cunningham of Happy Days as the family doctor.  Great fun!".

	schema:reviewBody "If I were asked what my favorite film of all time was I would probably say either The Last Picture Show or Ordinary People two films that I feel are legitimate masterpieces.  But if I were asked what my favorite film of all time REALLY was I'd have to say Yours Mine and Ours which was one of the first movies my parents ever took me to along with a rerelease of Swiss Family Robinson and Steve McQueen's Bullitt as a fiveyearold. I've loved it my entire life and I have to admit my affection for it hasn't dimmed with age.  Although I realize it's not one of the great masterpieces of all time and I would never rate it as high as say Show or People or Casablanca or Schindler's List for that matter I still love this film all the same.I must admit that I am also a lifelong fan of I Love Lucy so the fact that Yours Mine and Ours stars Lucille Ball certainly has something to do with my fondness for this film.  And growing up in the '70's when costar Henry Fonda was relegated to cameo roles in awful films like The Swarm and Rollercoaster if it hadn't have been for his charismatic and likeable performance here I would never have known he was the great actor that he was.  Add the pleasure of Lucille's longtime friend Van Johnson in the prime supporting role of Darryl Fonda's best friend and an extremely young Tim Matheson as Fonda's oldest son and you have the foundation of an excellent cast in a lovely romantic comedy about the ultimate blended family think The Brady Bunch with brains and much much larger to boot.Very loosely based on a true story Ball is Helen North a recent widow with eight unruly children who moves to San Francisco for a fresh start.  While working at the infirmary at an unnamed Naval base she meets Naval Officer Frank Beardsley Fonda of course who is a recent widower himself with 10 children ! and has brought one of his daughters Suzanne Cupito aka '70's starlet Morgan Brittany in for treatment.  Helen and Frank are immediately smitten with each other and go out on a date but immediately break it off when they realize how many children their combined family would contain. Darryl realizes that eighteen children aside these two were made for each other and proceeds to plot to get them together.  They do eventually marry and this sets up many amusing scenes of this huge family trying to blend in together.  The nice thing about this film is that for once Lucille Ball is allowed to play a character completely different from Lucy Ricardo or Lucy Carmichael from The Lucy Show.  She is intelligent touching funny and very very human here.  In only one scene does she do any kind of Lucy shtick and that is during a wonderfully played drunk scene.  Even then she doesn't resemble her daffy TV persona as much as well a woman who's had too much to drink.  And the chemistry between Ball and Fonda is so believable as a child I found it hard to believe they were not really married in real life! Honest!  Johnson gives wonderful support and Tom Bosley has a few amusing scenes as the family's exasperated doctor.  I also loved the character of Madeline Love who Darryl sets Frank up with on a disastrous date that ends with her riding home between Frank and Helen who's been dumped by her Darrylarranged date.  Their discussion of their respective families ends with the hilarious exchange  Frank I'm glad I have ten children!  Helen I'm glad I have my eight!  Madeline  And I'm glad I'm careful!All in all this is an extremely enjoyable romantic comedy that grandkids can watch with their grandparents where everyone will be entertained and nobody will be embarassed.  An added treat  laughing at the '60's styles and hairdoes which look worse and worse with each passing decade.  They just don't make them like this anymore.  12 out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "OK the movie is really quite dated. Perhaps this is why the movie sells for less than 9.99 on DVD. But in spite of its being dated the movie is still very funny. Maybe it's funny because it is outdated. The movie was made a long long time ago in a day when comedy took priority over politically correct. With Madelyn Davis and Bob Carroll Jr writing the script it couldn't be anything but a sure fire winner. The two also provided their talents on I LOVE LUCY. Madelyn Davis was known as Madelyn PUGH during the I LOVE LUCY era.Lucille Ball in this movie has really taken a big risk in stepping out of her domain where she truly reigned as the queen of comedy. Her brilliance as a comedian has always been in her ability to act like the perfect scatterbrain driving a totally frustrated straight man well past his breaking point with her totally insane schemes. On TV this straight man was played by Desi Arnaz and later by Gale Gordon.In this movie Lucille Ball shone brighter than ever showing an ability to go from scatterbrain to serious to the point of tears and back so effortlessly. And there was no straight man to bounce her brand of comedy off of.Tom Bosely was hilarious as the family doctor with his deadpan approach. Seeing him later as Howard Cunningham in HAPPY DAYS I wonder if he was really acting or was he simply being himself? He certainly has that dry wit down to an art.Oh and then there is that issue of age. Lucille Ball was 57 and Henry Fonda was around 61 when the movie was made. This issue is obviously irrelevant. The movie was a hit when it was released in 1968. And it obviously beats that remake in 2005 hands down in spite of the age of leading roles in the remake.Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda rule!".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm big on believability so I'd have to agree that both Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda were a bit long in the tooth to be portraying parents whose oldest children were about sixteen and about fourteen at the time of their marriage.  I read the original book by Helen Beardsley Who Gets the Drumstick on which this film was based long before seeing the film so I remember from the book that at the time she was widowed Helen North was 32 years old.  No way would Lucy in her nurse's mufti pass for 33 in that infirmary scene with Henry Fonda.  I can't remember how old Frank Beardsley was  at least 8 or 10 years older than Helen though.  Still Henry Fonda didn't pass for fortysomething when he opened the film with Ohninehundred and looked at his watch on the way home to his kids.Second the situation with Louise which was not based on anything that happened in the book  Frank Beardsley actually met Helen North through his sister a nun in the school where Helen's kids enrolled after their father's death and their move from Washington State to the San Francisco area struck me as completely incredulous.  She was one of ten children including seven sisters and she's mad about having to share her room?  Surely by the time she hit fourteen she would've tried to make the best of the situation and learned that complaining did no good.Third in the scene where Frank is away on the shakedown cruise and Helen opens one of his letters the first thing you notice is La Lucille's flawlessly polished long nails and beautifully manicured hands.  A mother of eighteen who spends her days scrubbing cooking and doing laundry does not have hands like this.  My own mother only had five kids and trust me it doesn't work that way.  LOLI have no idea what the real Beardsley family thought about the movie that portrayed their story.  The original story as related in the book was really heartwarming and I think the screenwriters should've been more faithful to the book.  Helen Beardsley died on April 26 2000 of complications from Parkinson's Disease.  She was 70.  I understand that Frank is still living.".

It's not something I ever thought about before because the movie exists in a time of social shift between old school conservative values and lifestyles and hippies or at least more open minded sorts. It doesn't deal with these topics in a self aware or heavy handed way which makes it great! Aside from the girl's remark Oh cut your hair! which could be seen as a bit didactic it doesn't come off as propaganda of either sort.One thing I've always loved about this movie is the realism  unflinching pragmatism about the situation. The only caveat to that is that it's still difficult to imagine how they paid for all the kids!But the happy ending is undermined by the real world history that soon followed. We know that the one who left was going to a doomed situation that would forever shift the consciousness of American society. We know that this was the point at which the long term economic downturn began with massive deregulation of industry and socioeconomic stratification. Some of us will also think about the people we didn't see in the crowd because of persistent segregation or the amount of waste generated by all the disposable packaging a suburban family of this size consumes. It's actually really annoying to not be able to overlook all these things that the time was oblivious of because it's no less a great movie and Lucille Ball is an angel and Henry Fonda isn't half bad! Some of the old time blokes in these movies are just teeth grindingly patronizing to the 'dolls' but he was written as a sympathetic man's man and holds up today as old fashioned but good hearted and caring.Awesome outfits too. Love this movie. If someone wrote a sequel it wouldn't be a comedy but rather just as grim as the BBC 7 Up series most likely. Highly recommend no less!".

	schema:reviewBody "YOURS MINE  OURS is the 1968 family classic based on a true story that among other things was an inspiration for the TV series THE BRADY BUNCH. This warm and entertaining comedy stars Lucille Ball as Helen North a widowed naval nurse who is the mother of eight children who meets and falls in love with Frank Beardsley Henry Fonda a widowed naval officer who is the father of ten children and the obvious complications that ensue when Helen and Frank decide to marry and blend their families. There are no surprises here...the children obviously object to the union and still think of themselves as separate families despite Frank and Helen's efforts to bring them together but everything does eventually iron itself out in true sitcom style. Lucille Ball has one of her best film roles here playing it relatively straight as Helen but the Lucy we know and love does get to shine through in a couple of comic scenes...one at a crowded bar where she does battle with a slip and a fake eyelash and during a dinner at Frank's house where Frank's sons have spiked her drink and she gets very drunk. Fonda proves to have a surprising gift for light comedy and his chemistry with Ball is unexpectedly solid. Van Johnson is very funny as the mutual friend who brings them together and Tom Bosley has some funny moments as the family doctor. There are several future stars featured in the film as the NorthBeardsley children including Tim Matheson Gil Rogers Morgan Brittany Mitch Vogel and Tracy Nelson. A true family classic that still makes me laugh out loud after almost 40 years.".

In my younger years to see Lucille Ball in anything else made me expect The Lucy Show or Here's Lucy both of which I watched sunup to sundown. Whether it was Yours MIne  Ours or Mame I was looking for the screwy redhead.In watching it straight thru this time I enjoyed the actual focus on life at that time and tending to so many kids such as the grocery shopping breakfast and laundry time. The dating seemed a bit hokey to me and HOllywooded but believe it or not Jane Fonda has revealed on a Barbara Walters interview that there was sparks between her father and Ms. Ball.Still it was Tim Matheson the voice of Jonny Quest and Eric Shea the voice of Linus Van Pelt who kept it moving. While Matheson resented the new family and mother he wasn't hostile to Shea who was indeed lost in the shuffle and going his own path. Ball might have been able to conceal her age more had her voice not have been gone as it was which for some reason makes her seem older anyway.Still things like the phone call with one of Fonda's daughters listening in was priceless and truly hilarious but Ball's conversation with the nun about Shea's last name was it North or Beardsley now was clumsy and awkward and really could have been structured better.I did not realize this was based on a true story which makes it all the more incredible.Actually Sherwood Schwartz had proposed the idea for the Brady Bunch to networks several years before and they wouldn't buy the show until the success of Yours MIne and Ours and With Six You Get Eggroll then the Brady Bunch got the major league green light. Also Here's Lucy was to be similar to Yours MIne and Ours with her having a bunch of kids but that was dropped in favor of her two real kids.And worth noting ubiquitous Larry Hankin appears as the grocery clerk Harry. Hankin appears in programs and movies over the next three decades but may be best recognized as the television Kramer on Seinfeld when Jerry sold the show within his show.".

Not to mention Fonda was a man who was emotionally distant to his children starring in a movie like Yours Mine and Ours but being the great actor he is never is he out of place.Yours Mine and Ours doesn't have a massive amount of substance but has just enough to keep it afloat. It's not the most advanced comic material for the likes of Lucille Ball but she makes the most of it. Apparently Fonda became deeply in love with Ball during filming and the two became very close always a benefit to the onscreen chemistry. Likewise sex references still manage to slip into a family film He'll bring me home in plenty of time for dessert. The cinematography is also surprisingly advanced for a movie of this kind such as seen in the very opening shot of the film in which the camera pans back from a close up of Fonda to a battleship in its entirety. Likewise there are plenty of effective shots of San Francisco.The oldfashioned family ideals in Yours Mine and Ours were not in tune with a changing America of the time. The film was originally to be made in the early 60's but was delayed due to various setbacks but the fashions present here are clearly of the late 60's. With the film's inclusion of battleships and planes the movie clearly has US Navy endorsement and I can see this promilitary aspect of the film not going down well during the days of the Vietnam War. Likewise at the end of the film the eldest son Michael Beardsley joining the armed forces so I guess that's off to Nam! This is the aspect of Yours Mine and Ours which I find the most interesting it's a film which the product of before it's time clinging onto bygone values. For example the movie has Van Johnson in a supporting role whom I've always pictured as being an archetypal 50's actor. But more importantly Frank Beardsley can't be a stay at home father he's clearly a man's man as evident from his high ranking position in the navy.".

That quote stated by Stephanie after watching Dennis Quaid get hit in the head for about the 18th time serves as a strong indictment of this most unnecessary of remakes but sadly it's one of the nicest things one can say about the film.Easily one of the 10 worst movies of the year Yours Mine and Ours should be more aptly titled Suck Suck and Suck. Is there still a market for movies that feature little more than a bunch of young kids eating tons of sweets splattering a house with paint and hating each other? I figured such uncreative antics had run their course but perhaps I was wrong. Or perhaps the people involved with this production simply had no better ideas.Were the writers even trying? Stephanie asked me as Dennis Quaid got splattered with paint fell in a pool of goo and then tripped over a flatulent pig that of course eats at the family dinner table. No they weren't I replied as I stared dumbfounded at the screen shaking my head over the fact that the writers expect us to laugh about kids vomiting and then falling in it.I suppose I should commend the movie for warning the audience right away just how bad a time they can expect to have if they attempt to sit through the full 90 minutes. If the Nickelodeon Films moniker fails to send up any red flags then the fact that Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo possibly the hottest 51yearold woman on the planet meet rekindle their high school relationship get engaged get married and buy a brand new house all within the first 10 minutes should seal the deal that it's in your best interest to sprint to the exit and ask for your money back.There are two legitimately funny scenes in the movie one involving Dennis Quaid brushing his tongue. Everything else has been done several times with equally unfunny results. Oh look Dennis Quaid's son has accidentally started up a forklift at the store! Oh look Dennis Quaid just jumped on the forklift and his head is bumping against every box in the store! Oh look Dennis Quaid's credibility can actually be seen leaking out of the screen! That's what's considered funny these days?And just when you think things can't get any worse the writers decide to blindside us with an ending so ridiculously sappy that you'll be wishing you brought your trusty yellow bucket and you'll pray for an end to your dry heaving. I officially hate lighthouses now.I suppose 10yearold girls might enjoy this but if you value your time or money then I recommend that you stay away. Far away. This is a movie so the opposite of hilarious that I'm forced to come up with a new word for it  lolarious pronounced lowlarious. Feel free to use the word amongst friends. Hopefully its popularity will spread and it will one day be added to the dictionary. At least then I could say one good thing came out of the film.As it stands Yours Mine and Ours ain't mine I'm pretty sure you don't want it to be yours and if we made it ours then we'd only end up arguing over who would be the one to get rid of it.".

No they weren't I replied as I stared dumbfounded at the screen shaking my head over the fact that the writers expect us to laugh about kids vomiting and then falling in it.I suppose I should commend the movie for warning the audience right away just how bad a time they can expect to have if they attempt to sit through the full 90 minutes. If the Nickelodeon Films moniker fails to send up any red flags then the fact that Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo possibly the hottest 51yearold woman on the planet meet rekindle their high school relationship get engaged get married and buy a brand new house all within the first 10 minutes should seal the deal that it's in your best interest to sprint to the exit and ask for your money back.There are two legitimately funny scenes in the movie one involving Dennis Quaid brushing his tongue. Everything else has been done several times with equally unfunny results. Oh look Dennis Quaid's son has accidentally started up a forklift at the store! Oh look Dennis Quaid just jumped on the forklift and his head is bumping against every box in the store! Oh look Dennis Quaid's credibility can actually be seen leaking out of the screen! That's what's considered funny these days?And just when you think things can't get any worse the writers decide to blindside us with an ending so ridiculously sappy that you'll be wishing you brought your trusty yellow bucket and you'll pray for an end to your dry heaving. I officially hate lighthouses now.I suppose 10yearold girls might enjoy this but if you value your time or money then I recommend that you stay away. Far away. This is a movie so the opposite of hilarious that I'm forced to come up with a new word for it  lolarious pronounced lowlarious. Feel free to use the word amongst friends. Hopefully its popularity will spread and it will one day be added to the dictionary. At least then I could say one good thing came out of the film.As it stands Yours Mine and Ours ain't mine I'm pretty sure you don't want it to be yours and if we made it ours then we'd only end up arguing over who would be the one to get rid of it.";

	schema:reviewBody "The advent of mixed families is certainly more relevant today than it was when this film was originally made in 1968 with Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda in the leads but that doesn't make this newer version a better film  not by a long shot.That movie was quaint and cute for it's time had a great emotional conclusion and even inspired the television series The Brady Bunch. This is  by far  one of the worst films of the Year of Bad Films. It is directed by Raja Gosnell which is appropriate because he was responsible for both horrid ScoobyDoo movies as if he were hit on the head with a huge circus mallet. This picture tries to combine joy love comedy pathos and crude slapstick into a rollicking family good time.It doesn't work. The leads Renee Russo Two for the Money and Dennis Quaid Flight of the Phoenix have no chemistry and the children  all amazingly attractive but talentless  are nothing more than annoying and idiotic. The situations they are tossed into are farfetched ridiculous and worst of all totally unfunny. Not the best thing to say about a comedy.Frank Beardsley Quaid is a widower with eight mostly cute blonde blueeyed children and a Coast Guard Admiral to boot. He runs the family well like a Coast Guard Admiral constantly blowing his hornpipe having them fall in and organizing them into work groups. After moving to New London Conn. in one of the great plot conveniences of alltime he meets widow Helen North a freespirited handbag designer who knew Frank in high school.Within one jump cut  and without meeting each other's offspring  the two tie the knot. Thus when the families finally get together the kids  naturally  hate each other. Among these actors there is every type of clich a Boy Scout a military cadet a cheer leader a punk rocker a grunge singer a couple of sets of twins two precocious little boys and other assorted goofballs.Also to keep things as diverse and politicallycorrect as possible Helen adopted six of hers including some Mexicans Indians a jive black dude and a gay Asian. It's like the floor of a Democratic National Convention. Add to this mishmash a potbellied pig why directors think a strange pet is funny is way beyond me  remember the duck in The Pacifier? who makes about 100 appearances including at a hardware store at the kids' school and in Frank's bed and you have a recipe for Holiday disaster. It's like having the whole family over and your father gets fallingdown drunk and knocks over the tables with the food on it. No wait that would actually be humorous.

	onyx:emotionText "The advent of mixed families is certainly more relevant today than it was when this film was originally made in 1968 with Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda in the leads but that doesn't make this newer version a better film  not by a long shot.That movie was quaint and cute for it's time had a great emotional conclusion and even inspired the television series The Brady Bunch. This is  by far  one of the worst films of the Year of Bad Films. It is directed by Raja Gosnell which is appropriate because he was responsible for both horrid ScoobyDoo movies as if he were hit on the head with a huge circus mallet. This picture tries to combine joy love comedy pathos and crude slapstick into a rollicking family good time.It doesn't work. The leads Renee Russo Two for the Money and Dennis Quaid Flight of the Phoenix have no chemistry and the children  all amazingly attractive but talentless  are nothing more than annoying and idiotic. The situations they are tossed into are farfetched ridiculous and worst of all totally unfunny. Not the best thing to say about a comedy.Frank Beardsley Quaid is a widower with eight mostly cute blonde blueeyed children and a Coast Guard Admiral to boot. He runs the family well like a Coast Guard Admiral constantly blowing his hornpipe having them fall in and organizing them into work groups. After moving to New London Conn. in one of the great plot conveniences of alltime he meets widow Helen North a freespirited handbag designer who knew Frank in high school.Within one jump cut  and without meeting each other's offspring  the two tie the knot. Thus when the families finally get together the kids  naturally  hate each other. Among these actors there is every type of clich a Boy Scout a military cadet a cheer leader a punk rocker a grunge singer a couple of sets of twins two precocious little boys and other assorted goofballs.Also to keep things as diverse and politicallycorrect as possible Helen adopted six of hers including some Mexicans Indians a jive black dude and a gay Asian. It's like the floor of a Democratic National Convention. Add to this mishmash a potbellied pig why directors think a strange pet is funny is way beyond me  remember the duck in The Pacifier? who makes about 100 appearances including at a hardware store at the kids' school and in Frank's bed and you have a recipe for Holiday disaster. It's like having the whole family over and your father gets fallingdown drunk and knocks over the tables with the food on it. No wait that would actually be humorous. This movie is a bomb like none dropped on the slums of Baghdad by Dick Cheney.If this film were any more of a dog it would be dragging its butt across the driveway.

	schema:reviewBody "The movie Yours Mine and Ours was a terrible movie and a waste of my time to watch. The reasons are quite simple the actors sucked and the plot was the stupidest.The children supposedly don't like each other and have nothing in common. And instead of trying to explain to their parents that they can't stand each other have nothing in common and were unfairly forced together without their say they make a plan to try to break up their parents. Obviosly the kids have no respect toward their parents and their feelings even the older ones. So what ends up happening is they begin ruining their parents life.What I find the stupidest part of the movie and what really made it a waste of my time is that these kids supposedly don't like each other. Well it takes a lot of teamwork to pull of the tricks that they were pulling on their parents. They learned to respect each other and eventually even like each other and yet they were still trying to break their parents apart? The whole reason they wanted to part their parents is because they couldn't stand each other. So why didn't they stop their plan when they began to get along each other? Stupid plot stupid movie.The pig was a stupid addition these guys would not had made this movie without their stupid goals behind it. They said hey lets remake the 1968 movie Yours Mine and Ours so we can outnumber the kids in cheaper by the dozen. And then said hey lets add a potbellied pig so we can have an original family pet just like in The Pacifier. Also the fact the Quaid was married to another dress designer like in The Parent Trap. They take the wreckless slapstick style with no humor in it. This movie is a rip off of so many things and lacks the ability to make me laugh.And another stupid thing about this movie is the character Helen North. She has disciplinophobiaNot a real word as far as I know. She is scared of discipline total hippie. There is Nothing I hate more than somebody whether they are real or a character who is afraid to put their foot down. After the kids trash that store I thought their would be heavy consequences. After they throw that party without their parents permission behind their back when their home is full of complete strangers trashing their house and when the kids are neglected stored away and sick on junk food she tells Frank to relax?! I would expect any health parent to ship their kids off to military school after a stunt like thatonly the kids that threw the party. She is in a relaxing mood at a time like this? Pathetic and worse than that she was afraid to set any rules or boundaries. When Frank says There is nothing wrong with having rules. Everybody lives by them the entire universe lives by them. She says Well then Frank that's the last thing these kids need from me. There's only one rule I know and that's at any time all of this can be over. Taken away from you forever then who needs more rules after that.. Sounds a lot like a divorce threat to me. Why would any parentespecially a parent of ten want no rules or boundaries for their kids? Unrealisticly a terrible character it pisses me off so much I want to take my fist and..........I found nothing good about this movie except its alright for anybody 9 and under. I would have voted 0 but I can't.Also I feel sorry for all of you so naive to actually enjoy this movie. God remove the devil inside you for it.Don't waste your time.".

	schema:headline " Cheaper by TWO DOZEN!! Predictable but no so bad";
	schema:reviewBody "Yours Mine and Ours has some fatal flaws that for most especially critics destroyed the film although it's made more than it's fair share of profit. The film is brutally predictable and not only that but is far from a new concept coming along on the heels and in front of the Cheaper By The Dozen series. The single only difference is double the children. Unfortunately as cute as that sounds there is just too many cast members. There are so many children that only a small few of them ever get to show off their characters. The film still aims for the exact same comedy as Cheaper By The Dozen did...physical comedy usually involving the fact that so many children are under the same roof. The only plot variation is that these kids are trying to break up their new found parents because they hate each other.Dennis Quaid is by the book Navy Admiral Frank Beardsley. Quaid is always a terrific leading man and he can do action drama and also comedy including some very funny physical comedy and pulls it off flawlessly. He is in fact one of the highlights of this film and certainly brings the most ability to the cast. Rene Russo is free spirited and less regimented new wife Helen North who brings her 10 kids 6 adopted 4 of her own to the chaos. Russo is a good actress with a lot of experience and she nails a lot of big roles opposite basically every leading man in Hollywood but doesn't necessarily make her great. Her acting is a bit dry and over performed in this film. She borders on annoying and if I were Quaid I would have ran for the hills...High School sweetheart or not. The kids...well the kids do well but there is so darn many of them that none of them ever get the opportunity to really stand out with perhaps the exception of Sean Faris who plays eldest son William who plays a strong character but looks too old to be doing the things he gets involved with and the young twins Brecken and Bridger Palmer who are adorable and the perfect trouble makers. Again all the kids do a fine job but there is way too many parts to make any difference.The film beginning to end is complete chaos with a hint of a decent storyline but everything moves at such break neck speed. Quaid and Russo meet and marry in about thirty seconds and how much money would these guys actually need to support a family of TWENTY?? Plus housekeeper pig dog hamster etc. Russo and Quaid do have decent chemistry and Quaid's character is a good character and a good father and some of the cute moments are exactly that...cute...but not overly funny. Little kids will probably like the chaotic kids running wild fun but for most adults it'll get old quick. I will say as predictable and clearly mapped out as the film is the ending is still warm and fuzzy and will make you smile...any good feel good family flick should do that. It's not something you should avoid it's not as bad as critics say it is but it's mostly just a cute little family flick. 710".

The single only difference is double the children. Unfortunately as cute as that sounds there is just too many cast members. There are so many children that only a small few of them ever get to show off their characters. The film still aims for the exact same comedy as Cheaper By The Dozen did...physical comedy usually involving the fact that so many children are under the same roof. The only plot variation is that these kids are trying to break up their new found parents because they hate each other.Dennis Quaid is by the book Navy Admiral Frank Beardsley. Quaid is always a terrific leading man and he can do action drama and also comedy including some very funny physical comedy and pulls it off flawlessly. He is in fact one of the highlights of this film and certainly brings the most ability to the cast. Rene Russo is free spirited and less regimented new wife Helen North who brings her 10 kids 6 adopted 4 of her own to the chaos. Russo is a good actress with a lot of experience and she nails a lot of big roles opposite basically every leading man in Hollywood but doesn't necessarily make her great. Her acting is a bit dry and over performed in this film. She borders on annoying and if I were Quaid I would have ran for the hills...High School sweetheart or not. The kids...well the kids do well but there is so darn many of them that none of them ever get the opportunity to really stand out with perhaps the exception of Sean Faris who plays eldest son William who plays a strong character but looks too old to be doing the things he gets involved with and the young twins Brecken and Bridger Palmer who are adorable and the perfect trouble makers. Again all the kids do a fine job but there is way too many parts to make any difference.The film beginning to end is complete chaos with a hint of a decent storyline but everything moves at such break neck speed. Quaid and Russo meet and marry in about thirty seconds and how much money would these guys actually need to support a family of TWENTY?? Plus housekeeper pig dog hamster etc. Russo and Quaid do have decent chemistry and Quaid's character is a good character and a good father and some of the cute moments are exactly that...cute...but not overly funny. Little kids will probably like the chaotic kids running wild fun but for most adults it'll get old quick. I will say as predictable and clearly mapped out as the film is the ending is still warm and fuzzy and will make you smile...any good feel good family flick should do that. It's not something you should avoid it's not as bad as critics say it is but it's mostly just a cute little family flick. 710";

Dennis Quaid is out of his element in a comic film and it's obvious he is trying too hard. Also I've noted many similarities between this film and Cheaper By The Dozen which has basically the same Brady Bunch premise. Tim Allen would have been a better Admiral Beardsley but in truth he was busy working on The Shaggy Dog. Quaid does a fine job but it's just uncomfortable for me to see him in this film. It's evident he is trying to imitate Steve Martin's character in Cheaper By The Dozen. Rene Russo is a fine Helen North and plays her part well but she's dull and unintersting and of courses cannot live up to the actress who originated the role  Lucille Ball herself. Overall this film is funny but it's predictable.".

If you are a fan of Silence of the Lambs you should see this because Oliver O'Grady is just as chilling as Hannibal Lecter  more so because he is real. Filmmaker Amy Berg did a news piece on O'Grady a Catholic priest who raped dozens  possibly hundreds  of children in California. On a whim she called him in his exile in Ireland and got him to agree to an extensive three day interview. It is a confession unlike any other.On one level Deliver Us From Evil is a righteous indictment of the Catholic Church its inaction its enabling its bureaucracy its maledominated backwardness.At the same time the film is a profile of some incredibly decent people Catholic parents and children who were victims in this rampage. Their character is inspiring  their pain is as raw as anything you will ever see on film.Finally it's the study about the way a psychopath can play every human emotion to his own advantage.There is Hell to pay for this man's sins. And some victims are living that hell every day.".

Its machinations to cover up the crimes against the children who they had an obligation to protect and nourish would be loathsome enough in secular society but they are an abomination in the church.

Similar to Schindler's List the gripping tales told by Catholic Religious leaders and victims of child molestation in the Church held me in suspense of reality and opened my eyes to the scale and duration of the problem which still exists in many places today. The disturbing part was the institutional course of action and lack of action taken when high leaders were made aware of the problem and asked for help by BOTH sexual victims AND sexual offenders. As with many parts of systematic human intervention the easiest thing to do was to ignore or divert and continue. This film is an eye opener.

	schema:reviewBody "This is mighty strong documentary on the abuse of children by the Catholic Church and its coverup. I read elsewhere that the term abuse is a euphemism for much more sordid acts namely the physical rape of an innocent child.This film examines the history of one pedophile priest in the United States and how his acts were simply coveredup by the Catholic hierarchy. He performed innumerable acts on both male and female children. Even though some parents reported this to the Catholic ministry it was only when police officials became involved that he was arrested. There are many interviews with both the victims and those in the Church hierarchy who covered it up as well as the pedophile himself.So are we provided with many different angles. The documentary never becomes accusatory in itself  but it allows us to view the heartwrenching lives of the victims and their families. They try to extract an apology from the Vatican but this is all in vain.It even brings us to view the life of this eerie pedophile not presented as evil incarnate but as a human being with a severe psychological problem. At times you can feel his ingratiating performance even as he acknowledges the severity of what he has done. This is a rare film that deals with both oppressor and oppressed.The film is about several things the nature of the evil that exists in this pedophile the corruption of the Catholic Church the Church's refusal to deal with sexual issues and admit its crimes against humanity but most of all it is about the torment of the victims who are left alone with their families to struggle on with their lives. This documentary contains some very emotional scenes and is very well made.".

It is wrong to abuse children. I never imagined the extent of betrayal and deceit in the catholic priests' scandal. It is shocking scary and disgusting.Talking about the film proper I think it is very nicely done. How Jyono's family turns from support to anger is touchingly portrayed. Putting Nancy's trauma with Jyono's support seem to give a balanced picture of the situation. That is until later when the truth is revealed. Anne Jyono's trauma is central to the film because Anne still has faith despite all the wrongs done to her. The most heartbreaking scene in the film is when Anne breaks down after hearing her father lost faith and announces that There is no God.With the actual convict also appearing to give interview I find Deliver Us From Evil the most convincing and truthful. It is sad to see that O'Grady's guilt is very superficial.A truly outstanding film is able to evokes a plethora of emotions. Especially sadness disgust sympathy. Deliver Us From Evil is able to do all these. It seamlessly takes viewers into a journey of trauma and despair of the victims the guilt of the family members for being to trusting deceit and ruthless lies to cover things up.The other brave souls who overcome all the obstacles and let the world know about these heinous crimes are remarkable. The people who funded and worked on this film are remarkable. They face an insurmountable giant and they are not afraid to speak out. They need to let the world know. This film is shocking touching and saddening. It breaks my heart to see hundreds of thousands of lives wrecked by their trusted authority figure.

The victims and their families rage with intense fresh pain despite the decades.The ray of hope in this movie is Father Thomas Doyle a priest who reaches out to the families with compassion hugs apologies. He's articulate and knowledgeable about church polity and politics as well as the spiritual rape that occurs when kids are abused by a religious leader and he knows his Jesus that is he shows Christ talked about suffering little children to come to me..for such is the kingdom of God. I still don't understand how the church leadership in California i.e. in this specific case leadership forgot this teaching of Jesus regarding children But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.I wish this topic would have come up more in the film.Addendum  My thoughts led me back to this film as I recently learned that someone had abused one of my former students. Deliver us from evil came immediately to mind this movie woke me up to the fact that a nicecharmingwellmanneredharmlesslookinggreatwithkids person can really be dangerous evil and treacherous i.e. prowling around like a roaring lion. For this reason I think every adult should see this movie. Just today I read how a man in Chicago abused a girl after befriending her mom. She said their friendship grew to the point where she allowed him to take her son and daughter on outings. I cannot but think that if either the momneighborrelativefriend saw this movie someone might have said uttered a word of caution which could have prevented such a tragedy. Clearly the priests who shuffled around the abusers and effectively covered up these scandals underestimated the trauma and damage caused by abuse. But just what were they thinking? They won't remember it. They'll get over it. Yet the testimony of the people in this movie show that the longterm damage is enormous. What really went on in the heads of the leadership?

This thoughtful documentary by Ms. Berg will tear at your heart as you view it. There are no magic answers here. The film will make no one feel better about what has gone in in the Catholic church for centuries. What the film WILL do is help you better understand the lifelong pain that sexual abuse brings not only directly to the victim but indirectly to families and even future relationships.Ms. Berg's film brings sexual abuse to the viewer in a truthful and compassionate way that I've never seen before. Not that there has never been sexual abuse of children by a Baptist minister or Jewish Rabbi or others who wear the cloth of clergy...I'm sure there has been...but the systematic cover up by the Roman Catholic church should be an embarrassment to all officials in the Church from the Pope down to the Parish Priest.Every seminary student regardless of his or her religion should be required to see this movie. Every Roman Catholic should see this movie. Everyone who breaths air should see this movie and talk about it to everyone else.".

	schema:reviewBody "Deliver Us From Evil is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. In fact it might be one the best movies period. I remember watching Ebert  Roeper review this film back in 2006. I wanted to see it but since documentaries are hard to find in the theater I had to wait until it came out on DVD. One thing led to another and I totally forgot about the movie. Recently I started thinking about it again but I couldn't remember the name. I'm glad I tracked it down because it is truly an amazing film. I'm a Catholic and went to Catholic schools from Kindergarten through high school. That being said you don't have to be Catholic to watch this film. You don't even have to be religious. Simply put everybody should see this movie. For those who don't know Deliver Us From Evil chronicles pedophile priest Oliver O' Grady. The film soon unfolds into a decades long conspiracy by the church to cover up O 'Grady's actions. The scary thing about this film is that you're not really sure who the bigger villain is. Is it Father O' Grady a priest who rapes and molests children? Or is the true villain the Bishops and Monsignors who turned a blind eye and just moved O' Grady from parish to parish. Possibly the most disturbing aspect of the film is that while watching Father O' Grady discuss his actions it's hard to tell if he really believes that what he did was wrong. He's so matter of fact and creepy you just want to jump through the TV and strangle him. Deliver Us From Evil is shocking in the sense of how high up the conspiracy goes. The Pope is literally an accomplice in cases such at this. More than anything the one theme I came away with after watching Deliver Us From Evil is that the Church is a business and just like everything else in the world is wrapped up in politics more than anything else.".

	schema:reviewBody "Harboring Impure Thoughts is a sin in the mores of the Catholic Church. If one is attracted to a person sexually a man a woman at whatever age one also associates that quality with the object of even the most conventional Catholic marriage. So to a man who from the start of his sexual growth is trained as a Catholic priest what's the difference between an object of pure lust and an object of affection? The danger in turn is not merely a danger to his own self but a danger to those objects of lust and affection of his. What's more religion is extremely important to many people in all cultures. These people have children who are raised with an obedient conventional moral code that links inscrutability with their elders whose trust is very easy for a neighborhood priest their nearest connection with God to acquire.Watching Amy Berg's effective documentary Deliver Us from Evil is a compelling encounter. Her interview cases betray to the camera virtually insufferable stratums of grief and its audience goes home feeling both bewilderment and anger. There is an integral interview subject who is an Irish Catholic priest who is undeterred by where Catholic orthodoxy has led his decisions to rape and molest 25 children who looked up to him saw him as a father and is living out his days in the Irish countryside. If any citizen otherwise had committed the same crime they would be playing the role of the child to a much bigger stronger rapist for decades. What is it about this ideology that causes people all over the world to treat related matters with superiority over everyone else? I suppose it is the centuries of tradition that is reassuring to society even while these families are burdened with crippling depths of shame for as long as they last. The weight of their shame is directly related to that of the trust they put into their victimizers.The film is not an indictment of people who practice the Catholic faith. Not by any means. It is a buoy for the devoutly faithful subjects surrounding Father Oliver O'Grady who in the 1970s and '80s committed his crimes only to spend a mere seven years in prison and still keep his job a voice and a vent for them. I know I haven't said much about the film itself but the fact that I would rather talk about what the film made me think about should speak of the value of seeing it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The spellbinding power of this Oscar Nominee for Best Documentary comes from its chilling subject matter a notorious pedophile priest and the coverup of his heinous acts by the Roman Catholic hierarchy in the state of California. Director Amy Berg's documentary is clearsighted and toughminded  a portrait of individual criminality and institutional indifference. A study in the betrayal of trust and the irresponsibility of authority. In addition to giving faces and voices to victims who are often anonymous it offers an interview with a convicted expriest who admits his crimes without remorse. Deliver Us from Evil presents three case studies of Father O'Grady's abuse. Simply put jawdropping.In the 1970s and 80s Father O'Grady was serving as a parish priest in several towns in Central California where he molested children over and over again both boys and girls including a 9monthold. Filmmaker Amy Berg masterfully exposes just how deeply rooted the corruption runs. Armed with anguished testimony from the families of the abused and their lawyers she seamlessly presents indisputable evidence that the Church knew about O'Grady's activities. The hierarchy moved him from one parish to another simply to avoid public scandal and to prevent destroying the careers of those in power.Present day and walking around the streets of Dublin O'Grady peers into a schoolyard with an interest that can only appear perverse after what's been revealed about him. He seems so removed from his crimes that he could be an actor playing the part of a pedophile expriest. That he agreed to appear in Deliver Us From Evil is an indication not just of an oversized ego but also a complete failure to comprehend of what he has actually done. Father O'Grady walks freely today in Ireland not even registered as a sex offender. Deliver Us From Evil has already prompted legal attention in Los Angeles toward Cardinal Roger Mahoney who allowed more than 550 priests under his jurisdiction to molest children without punishment.Watching this documentary and especially the interviews with O'Grady is so much more disturbing than any piece of fiction could ever be. This is a real monster victimizing children and it was allowed by a group that was claiming to do God's work.".

Amazing stuff.Other parts of the film are not so good. Ms Berg somewhat understandably can not seem to avoid editorializing by filming part of the interview with the pedophile near a playground or shooting the descent into hell sequence at the beginning. Also too much time was spent with the renegade reformer Catholic priest and his views which are not Catholic ones as initially presented. These and other Michael Moore type moments in the film are minor quibbles and for the most part the story is poignantly told by the participants.Strangely enough the major villain is not the creepy pedophile O'Grady. Although an obvious manipulator and liar like most pedophiles he claims he was abused as a boy by both his siblings and his priest whose name he can't recall... he seems to be very simple and perhaps a bit mentally challenged. Much worse is the cardinal who secured his position by allowing and at least 100 other priests to continue their abuse and the institution that allows it to continue.".

O'Grady's appearances being equally poignant provide an intimate glimpse into a child molester's psyche.

And the Catholic church's response to the abuse is shocking embarrassing and criminal.

	schema:reviewBody "Deliver Us From Evil opens this Thursday in selected cinemas. I had already ordered the DVD from the USA but was privileged to attend a preview screening tonight in Brisbane and witness its impact on the big screen and on a large audience.Deliver Us From Evil is an Academy Award nominated feature film about the Catholic Church's routine practice of covering up and refusing to cooperate when accusations of sexual abuse are made against their clergy. We are told of the Church's official attitude that even a molesting priest is more valuable than any lay person.It's a hard hitting story which leaves you shaking with anger at a religious organisation which is fatally dominated by selfobsessed fanatics as well as riddled with cronies desperate to do anything and cover up anything in order to get to the top.No surprise therefor that the Catholic Church refused to be interviewed for the film  however the main subject Oliver O'Grady a serial paedophile with hundreds of Churchaccessed victims is quite happy to talk things over. He discusses his child abuse activities as if they were just bad decisions that he happened to make at the time.O'Grady is a sick man but his supervisors were very well aware of his activities and rather than just do nothing they actually enabled his access to new victims by quickly shifting him to another parish whenever the heat was on. O'Grady's superior Cardinal Mahoney had his eyes firmly set on being a papal candidate.The filmmakers make the clear point that the Catholic Church was sending up a smokescreen in announcing its witchhunt for gay priests in seminaries  when the vast majority of paedophile priests are known to be heterosexual. It is claimed that 10 of USA Catholic clergy have abused children  with perhaps hundreds of thousands of victims yet to be identified.The official film website includes useful information on the press page  such as the 1962 Vatican instruction to all Bishops on the procedure for covering up sexual abuse scandals  with the prime objective of protecting the Church from financial loss. I checked the website for that document tonight and even though it's listed the hyperlink draws a page not found. Hopefully the link will be restored.Pope Benedict is shown as being up to his neck in direct responsibility for the official actions of the Church in systematically protecting paedophiles at the expense of the victims. However we're advised that President George W. Bush Jnr kindly granted him immunity from prosecution. Maybe George is hoping for a reciprocal pardon for the many thousands of deaths he's responsible for in Iraq.Deliver Us From Evil is a necessary force for doing good in the world  opening the viewer's eyes to this further proof that absolute power corrupts absolutely. The Catholic Church will win no new converts because of this film  but you'd hope that those who do remain with the organisation will aggressively demand action to reach out with honesty and compassion to the victims to ensure that in future lay people not the clergy come first and to ensure that no further systemic abuse is possible.This film made me damned glad to be a longterm exCatholic.Definitely 10 out of 10  but with the warning that this is not a date movie unless you've got a thing for heated post movie debriefings.".

	schema:reviewBody "Attn Contains spoilersFirst although O'Grady did have the courage to participate in the making of this film and although he commented several times that the molestation events should never have occurred still he came across as a man not fully comprehending the great harm that he had done to the children he molested many of whom are now grown adults nor to their families. His attitude conveyed in the film was if not insouciant at least shallow Well I did a bad thing and I'm sorry so I'll write a letter to my victims apologizing and then we can all get on with our lives. Although not phony it certainly didn't strike me that he felt any deep remorse for what he had done. Several other comments are these 1 We don't learn until the last third of the movie that O'Grady himself was a victim of abuse chiefly by his older brother Would it have been pertinent if he had participated in the film? but also by a priest whose name O'Grady had either forgotten or repressed. This is not surprising in itself since most pedophiles have a history of abuse but O'Grady didn't seem to draw the connection of these experiences with his own problem. Amazing! 2 It is clear that several members of the higher clergy of the Roman Catholic Church were cognizant of O'Grady's criminal activities. Rather than turn him over to the police and drum him out of the Church they merely shuffled him around from parish to parish. The topping on the cake so to speak was when Mahony appointed O'Grady as the sole priest in charge of a parish San Andreas in Calaveras County CA. Ultimately the Roman Catholic Church failed utterly to address the problem and it is clear by the activities of Father Tom Doyle that it still has failed to come to grips with the issue. The Church's behavior exhibits a perfect example of the ostrich effect Stick your head in the sand and maybe the whole problem will blow away with the wind. 3 The film did bring out the idea of the possibility of the Roman Catholic clergy failing to distinguish among different levels of sexual activity that a priest might have lumping them all together under illicit sex. This suggests that they would equate sex with an adult female as equivalent to sex with a minor when clearly what must be distinguished is the maturity and complicity of the person with whom the priest engages in a sexual act assuming that he indeed do so. 4 It also strongly suggests that seminarians particularly those entering the Roman Catholic priesthood undergo some sort of psychological evaluation by a competent person to determine if they are fit material for the priesthood. 5 The other issue that rose in my mind watching the movie was whether pedophilia is as widespread among clerics of other Christian sects and nonChristian clerics. Even if a man be allowed to marry as is the case with most Protestant pastors Eastern Orthodox priests and Jewish rabbis a pedophile is attracted to young children and the fact that he's married or not probably doesn't bear on his predilection from a psychological standpoint. 6 Given that the film focused on a Roman Catholic priest at the time he committed the molestations and who is still a practicing Roman Catholic no one asked O'Grady the obvious questions that had been going through my mind Mr. O'Grady when you were contemplating molesting a child were you not aware that by so doing you were committing a mortal sin? And by carrying through your thought to an overt act were you not aware that you were committing an even more heinous mortal sin? Surprisingly no one asked O'Grady these questions.".

	schema:reviewBody "Deliver us from evil is a documentary film exposing the atrocities committed by Irish born Father Oliver O'Grady and his time as priest and leader of a parish in various different towns in California. It also displays the conspiracy of the Catholicism its constant protection of employees within the church and the lengths they went to to protect gods name while standing by and watching children robbed of their innocence.Although much of the information we see about the Catholic Church and the corruption at the very heart of it is not completely surprising and I'm sure many people already have their beliefs on paedophilia within the church and its ongoing coverup it is with the shameless nature that these Men of god talk about the case that is difficult to watch. When Bishop Mahony is asked at one point If you knew of a priest having sexual urges towards boys and girls as young as 8 or 9 would that be just cause to remove him from his post he replies in monotone No . It is unsettling to say the least and combined with interviews with the offender himself Father O'Grady a truly vile and disgusting individual and clearly sociopathic and the victims and their families we are presented with such a hopeless and desperate story from where there truly is no redemption.Father O'Grady intersperses the documentary with various appalling remarks and commentaries and it is abundantly clear from the get go that he has no sense of realty and that the disconnection he has leads to a point where he feels it is acceptable to write to his victims and arrange a nice friendly reunion. It is so farfetched and so ridiculous that we have to questions his sanity and motives throughout. He gives us certainly no just cause for sympathy describing with a smirk what he did with various young girls and boys and what aroused him and why. The saddest part being that after this documentary was made he was arrested and sentenced to three years for further child pornography charges. It begs the questions how can the Catholic Church protect him still and how has he evaded a longer jail sentence.The Catholic Church is presented in such a poor light that it's very difficult to know what to believe and who to trust. With more and more cases emerging of child abuse within the church and of many more cases that still go unresolved and undiscovered it is an eye opening insight into the truth and the need to protect our children and the children of the future with such reverence and love.The victims and their families who gave interviews during the film are unfathomably brave people. It seems that for some there is no light at the end of the tunnel and even 30 years later they remain as scarred and as unhealed as before. It is truly heart retching to see the long term affect this has particularly to those who believed so fervently in god before and who feel betrayed and violated themselves by the church.While the film does not offer hope nor light it does offer us truth and facts that may have remained hidden. It is very honest and does not shy away or worry that it may offend. If nothing else we can learn so much from this film and focus on bringing justice to the victims and their families and work so much harder to find and punish those responsible.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching this well made documentary concerning the realities of the abuses of religion in general and the Catholic Church in particular just makes more concrete the need to truly question the belief in any ancient archaic and primitive religion. The abuse of children by the HOLY Catholic Church where there have been 100000 REPORTED abuses in the USA alone is horrendous! Add to that the fact that an estimated 80 of those abused by Catholic priests never reported the rapes and molestations and you can see clearly the EVIL of this religion. The cover up is as damning as the abuses themselves. This is a record that is not new... that is the history of sexual perversion within the powerful ranks of the Catholic Church is easily a 1600 year ordeal.If you still believe in the God of the Bible my only question is this When exactly will you get around to actually reading the Bible? Within the pages of the Bible is a horrible vengeful murder ordering slave tolerating God. And it is the continuation and evolution of these ancient archaic and primitive beliefs that are still being used misused and abused to control human beings sexually politically financially and emotionally.For me this is just one more reason to turn to REASON! Let go of your imaginary little friends and get away from mindnumbing and mindcontrolling priests bishops cardinals and popes.All the best The Prophet Willy".

Although I only have seen White  Victini and Zekrom and Black  Victini and Reshiram so far I can already feel the remainder of this retrospective hanging above my head like an outflow pipe of Damocles.Thank God then that Pokmon the Movie Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice is at 1h12m the shortest instalment in the series since Latias and Latios. It may not be good at least it's over quickly.The story's focus is the Pokmon Keldeo who wants to become a member of the elite group Swords of Justice but cannot enter yet because his horn isn't big enough. This may be a relatable problem for many boys but that doesn't justify the setup being almost 20 minutes long  not so much a prologue as the film's entire first act.No matter the size of his Sword of Justice Keldeo deems himself ready to fight and challenges the legendary Pokmon Kyurem to prove it. As expected Keldeo's horn can't get hard enough and he is nearly killed in a classic case of stranger danger. Only barely does he manage to escape thanks to the help of some friendly passersby.As it happens these saviours are Ash Ketchum and his cardboard friends. You may remember them as being the protagonists of the Pokmon television series. They are but sidecharacters in this film though here to give Keldeo a helping hand with his humble horn. Perhaps for the better. It is not like this cast has undergone any growth during the past twenty years. Keldeo at least has a haphazard but functional hero's journey to fulfil.'Haphazard but functional' is an apt description of the film as a whole  not so much an appreciation of the creators' effort but rather relief that they didn't mess up as badly as before. Turns out it was a matter of 'less is more'. Decisions like reducing Team Rocket to a cameo appearance or skipping Ash's obligatory tournament help make the plot feel less aimless.Not that what's left is any good. Kyurem moves through its story without any joy or scenic charm. In earlier films the production team would literally go out of their way to create an appealing backdrop from their story taking inspiration from places like Venice Barcelona Athens and the Netherlands but Roshan City is a cold and desolate place. I don't remember having seen a single inhabitant walking down its streets. The town is just there as the background for a quick fight scene before we can move on to the next uninspired location.I guess I could mention that the plot is stupid the pacing is off and the dialogue is terrible but why bother? Pokmon the Movie Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice is bearable. It is short and flimsy but not offensive like most other films from this era. And besides it has a message I can get behind. Always remember kids Size matters.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Pokmon adventure pretty much mostly falls flat. This is one of only two Pokmon movies that I would say I genuinely dislike. It's very apparent that very little effort was put into this one.The premise is pretty lame. Keldeo is determined to become a Sword of Justice and to become one he must defeat the monster Kyurem. Ash and the gang tag along for no reason other than that the plot requires it.The three Swords of Justice that have been training Keldeo are all boring onedimensional characters that were not explored or developed properly and we don't even get to see much of them. Kyurem also isn't given much depth and we get no back story about him whatsoever.There are many things that don't work and are done only to keep the plot moving such as the train tunnel ex machina scene and the gang conveniently finding a blimp to get away in from an abandoned museum how did they get the blimp to even work anyway?!.The script is very weak and contains too much obligatory dialogue. The use of flashbacks in this film is far too numerous and is even very strange in some instances. The plot kind of meanders and mostly feels like an extended TV episode. It also didn't help that Iris and Cilan are in the movie.There are some all right action scenes and the animation is pretty nice but at this point that doesn't really cut it anymore.This is one of the worst Pokmon movies if not the worst. This film has very little to offer even the least demanding of Pokmon fans. I just wish more thought and care was put into this. Recommended ONLY to people who want to see every single Pokmon movie but have your expectations considerably lowered.RATING D".

	schema:reviewBody "I guess we've reached the point where it's becoming redundant in the Pokmon movies. I am a self described huge fan of the series and want to see all the many movies. Of course I just want to see all the movies of really anything nowadays. This pokemon movie is one of the weirdest. It isn't until sixteen minutes that we see the main characters actually take some action! In a film that's really short that's a major flaw. We are introduced to Keldeo the pokemon that wants to defeat Kyurem who it can become a member of the Sword of Justice.It was weird seeing a movie that actually had five talking pokemon in it! Honestly it came off as pretty awkward. It looked more like I was watching Digimon. Keldeo was just fighting another pokemon for the fun of it so it was really lacking tension.

Of course I just want to see all the movies of really anything nowadays. This pokemon movie is one of the weirdest. It isn't until sixteen minutes that we see the main characters actually take some action! In a film that's really short that's a major flaw. We are introduced to Keldeo the pokemon that wants to defeat Kyurem who it can become a member of the Sword of Justice.It was weird seeing a movie that actually had five talking pokemon in it! Honestly it came off as pretty awkward. It looked more like I was watching Digimon. Keldeo was just fighting another pokemon for the fun of it so it was really lacking tension.

I like these anime shorts because they are usually without any human characters and have nice graphics. The Pokmon would be on their own speaking pure Poknese with narrator and though the format seems to be specially made for children personally I quite enjoy watching them!As the title suggests this animated feature is about the battle between the legendary dragon Pokmon Kyurem and the Sword of Justice quartet. It has interesting rite of passage and friendship plot but these featured Pokmon however speak human language through telepathy which is understandable but I thought it was too much to my liking. It is tolerable though. On a positive note the plot could be difficult to understand if we have to figure out everything these characters said in Poknese by ourselves right?What's different with this animated feature compared to older Pokmon films is that since generation IV Diamond  Pearl series there are more alternate forms of Pokmon. They are truly interesting but unfortunately I can't really say I enjoy generation V Best Wishes! series. From my personal Pokmon Movie Marathon I have realised that this generation could be my least favorite but that won't hinder me from reviewing it just like how I did with the rest of the animated features. It only means that I find them less appealing compared to the rest!Those aside Pokmon the Movie Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice 2012 ultimately makes a great family film. Although there are flaws it promotes great values and has great messages. From fear is our greatest enemy being reckless is no good and what we learn from defeat failure is most important the animated feature can be inspirational to all.".

How interesting.Not to mention Nobita's most loyal  helpful friends Giant and Suneo which always accompanies him in hundreds of his adventures and yet for hundreds of times always managed to betray  dishonor their friendship with Nobita by bullying sizing up cornering him being onlyafriendscenarioandopportunitywise and discards him on his daily life Instead of offering a helping hand sincere friendships and encouragements as what real friends would always do. Therefore as expected in this movie Giant and Suneo still lived up to their expectations by teaching Japanese kids about the values of friendship honor and good will. Nevertheless in the end our little heroes managed to capture hundredsthousands of their enemy's soldiers and ordered them all to be put to death by being fed alive to the giant shark. Too bad the movie finished before we can see how their enemies' limbs were ripped apart and eaten by the shark. Must've been censored then.But hey now that these grade five children have contributed to the gruesome deaths of their enemies then I guess there won't be another sequel to the mermaid series therefore it's a happy ending and the mermaids will live happily ever after  Well I'd personally give this movie a 10 out of 10. This truly is a magnificent movie. A true Quentin Tarantino's style movie made for kids. What a genius!".

	schema:headline " A superb documentary on several levels";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1966 England won the 8th World Cup in England but that is not the only story. As a result of only one place being allocated to Africa Asia and the Pacific region all but two countries boycotted and withdrew their teams leaving North Korea and Australia. Having been on opposite side of the war neither recognised each other so the game was played in Cambodia. Not giving them a chance in hell Australia and the world are shocked to be knocked about 61 and North Korea book their tickets to England  a political problem since England did not recognise the state of North Korea. After much Foreign Office horsetrading the team arrives and is drawn into the same group and Italy the Soviet Union and Chile. With nobody giving them a chance and a 30 loss and 11 draw behind them the North Koreans must beat Italy to deliver their Great Leader's request of 'one or two wins' and pull off a historic upset.I decided to watch this documentary because it was mere days to go until Euro 2004 kicked off and I was in the mood for football stories however this wonderful film gave me so much more than just that. For most of my generation 1966 only means one thing  England winning I suspect very few not alive at the time know of the North Korean team that went along. For most of us the words 'upset' and Korea' will only bring to mind the wonderful run South Korea had in 2002's World Cup knocking out Italy as it happens! but this story is just as exciting. In terms of football the film is very interesting not only in terms of the story but also in giving an insight into football of almost 40 years ago. Can you imagine a world cup being held in Middlesborough today? Not very glamorous is it! Certainly the idea of any team training on the grounds of a factory in Northern England as Korea did is unthinkable now  seeing the luxury England are living in in Portugal right now is further contrast. The style of football is also a lot less technical and I was surprised how many goals seemed to be scored by individual runs and then a shot.Anyway everyone loves the underdog and this film shows the underdog being supported by the English fans and pulling off the biggest shocks of the 1966 World Cup by sending Italy home and going 30 up in 20 minutes against Portugal. It is fascinating to see the players then  so full of fight and ignoring the odds playing with the sort of spirit that we all wish our domestic sides could muster. To hear them talk as old men just makes the matches even more interesting as they recall their thoughts and feelings  I suspect few of us will not be envious of a keeper who considers his net to be the reputation of his country and would rather die than let Italy score in it. As a sports film it is really interesting and was the first time I had heard the story told however this film is much more than that.As we all know North Korea is a mystery  a few months ago a massive explosion may have killed 100's over a large area but I still don't know more than that and little information ever came out regarding it. We all know the stories of human rights violations and their nuclear programme and this film just makes the place an even bigger mystery by showing a side of the people and the country that is appealing and mystifying at the same time. We hear these stories but yet I watched these old men stand at the foot of the Great Leader's statute and weep as they wished he could be there with them. Likewise many talk of great affection of meeting him and it is clear that they wanted nothing more than winning at least one game for him and their beloved country. It is fascinating because the makers got quite unique access into the country and present us with people's honest opinion  they may be lying for fear of state retaliation but I could only see genuine sorrow in their tears as they talked of their Leader's death. Like I said it is mystifying but it is a very interesting look into the country through the eyes of the football team.Overall this is a great film if you like football stories but also if you are interested in North Korea. I came for the football but the other layers Korea a picture of England  football 40 years ago etc all engaged me really easily. The story of the World Cup is great fun and the wider stuff about North Korea is fascinating and frustratingly confusing but in a good way. The end result is a disarmingly charming documentary that surprised me by just how interesting layered and fascinated it turned out to be  just like the team themselves my expectations were exceeded.".

	onyx:emotionText "In 1966 England won the 8th World Cup in England but that is not the only story. As a result of only one place being allocated to Africa Asia and the Pacific region all but two countries boycotted and withdrew their teams leaving North Korea and Australia. Having been on opposite side of the war neither recognised each other so the game was played in Cambodia. Not giving them a chance in hell Australia and the world are shocked to be knocked about 61 and North Korea book their tickets to England  a political problem since England did not recognise the state of North Korea. After much Foreign Office horsetrading the team arrives and is drawn into the same group and Italy the Soviet Union and Chile. With nobody giving them a chance and a 30 loss and 11 draw behind them the North Koreans must beat Italy to deliver their Great Leader's request of 'one or two wins' and pull off a historic upset.I decided to watch this documentary because it was mere days to go until Euro 2004 kicked off and I was in the mood for football stories however this wonderful film gave me so much more than just that. For most of my generation 1966 only means one thing  England winning I suspect very few not alive at the time know of the North Korean team that went along. For most of us the words 'upset' and Korea' will only bring to mind the wonderful run South Korea had in 2002's World Cup knocking out Italy as it happens! but this story is just as exciting. In terms of football the film is very interesting not only in terms of the story but also in giving an insight into football of almost 40 years ago. Can you imagine a world cup being held in Middlesborough today? Not very glamorous is it! Certainly the idea of any team training on the grounds of a factory in Northern England as Korea did is unthinkable now  seeing the luxury England are living in in Portugal right now is further contrast. The style of football is also a lot less technical and I was surprised how many goals seemed to be scored by individual runs and then a shot.Anyway everyone loves the underdog and this film shows the underdog being supported by the English fans and pulling off the biggest shocks of the 1966 World Cup by sending Italy home and going 30 up in 20 minutes against Portugal. It is fascinating to see the players then  so full of fight and ignoring the odds playing with the sort of spirit that we all wish our domestic sides could muster. To hear them talk as old men just makes the matches even more interesting as they recall their thoughts and feelings  I suspect few of us will not be envious of a keeper who considers his net to be the reputation of his country and would rather die than let Italy score in it.

	schema:reviewBody "Although I am not ordinarily a sports fan watching this documentary was an exhilarating and bittersweet experience. The success of the North Korean underdogs in the 8th World Cup was exciting to relive through documentary footage. The workingclass English burb they stayed in Middlesborough clearly adopted them for their cute underdog status for they were wellbehaved polite and hardworking soccer players. And at no taller than 5'5 on average as one spectator put it it was like watching a bunch of jockeys playing. It is comical that when they are bunked in a Roman Catholic monastery they are creeped out by the garish images of the crucifixion. Also impressive were the shots of 20000 N. Korean Citizens doing the most elaborate form of the The Wave known to man. The N. Koreans returned as heroes in N. Korea but still lived in a material way that would remind most Americans of poor people. Team members say they were able to get as far as they did in the competition primarily through emphasis on teamwork and national pride given their physical limitations against the Europeans. Certainly the most impressive achievements of human civilization have always been accomplished when people are united by some ideology or religion bound together for a common purpose. It makes one think of the pros and cons of teamwork vs. individualism free societies vs. communist ones. I was struck by how their atheistic communist ideology taught them to believe that each was responsible for their own destiny and yet the movie is filled with numerous shots of the team making reverential references to their Great Leader exactly in the manner in which a religious fundamentalist refers to God or Allah. A very interesting movie but it was obvious the team could not speak freely to the cameramen. Their words are laced with modesty and communist rhetoric. Strange how the most ideological and theologically governed societies are often the ones lacking the most in free speech. Unity vs. individualism the pros and cons of both soccer and politics.".

	schema:reviewBody "Daniel Gordon's documentary about the North Korean soccer team who went to England to play in soccer's 1966 World Cup finals is intensely moving and the filmmakers were given unprecedented access to North Korea where they interviewed the men who were on North Korea's team.  I'm not a soccer fan at all but it doesn't matter the film deals with the common humanity of the North Korean players and their British hosts who were able to put the Cold War aside at its height in 1966 and just focus on their love of the sport.  You can't help rooting for the North Korean team!  The shots of Pyongyang after the war in 1953 in 1966 during the soccer finals and in 2002 are fascinating especially shots of child musicians and the mass rallies at the stadiums.  With all of the propaganda we hear in the US about how terrible the North Koreans are in this film they are warm and friendly and surprise! they have a great sense of humor.

The unknown team from Communist North Korea play in the 1966 World Cup win the hearts of the English working class and are only sunk by a virtuoso performance from one of the best players in the world. This is their story. From the opening moments of the film to the archive footage and the interviews with the passionate team this film struck a chord with me and was more than just about football but the North Korean spirit. We remember the fluke result against Italy but this shows the other victories that can be achieved through passion and hardwork. They came to win the cup but they won British hearts in the process. The slant on the documentary isn't really political but the passion with which the Koreans speak of Kim Il Sung they convey what he means to them in one of the most touching moments of the film. They wanted to win for their people their leader and their country but nobody can call them losers.A joy to watch and I give it the highest recommendation.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review The Game of Their Lives";
	schema:reviewBody "In recent times I guess we're all too familiar with the bad press that North Korea is getting especially in its nuclear weapons programme. One of the last hardlined communist states left in the world we often wonder what goes on behind that iron curtain in its reclusive behaviour that have spawned many questions with little forthcoming answers. And documentaries which offer a sneak peek into what goes on behind that veil of secrecy would also be cast a doubtful eye whether the filmmakers were gagged from painting a more subjective angle.Naturally getting permission to shoot within North Korea isn't easy and Daniel Gordon and his crew spent more than 3 years obtaining that nod and for the fact that they were allowed unprecedented bandwidth to capture what they needed for their movie and I guess the good job they did with this opened another door for their other North Korean documentary titled A State of Mind. For those interested in the landscape of the state beyond the much publicized mass displays and sabrerattling military parades this film offers a wonderful montage of life in the country with plenty of everyday scenes fused into one sequence that was in my opinion too short as it left you wanting more.But let's get back to the subject matter and that's the exploration of what happened to the North Korean football team of 1966 who were very much written off by pundits all over despite their hard work at overcoming Australia in the qualifiers which stemmed very much from a history left unlearned just like how the Western forces underestimated the drive and will to win of the Imperial Japanese forces in WWII. The filmmakers had tracked down almost all the surviving members of that team of 66 and one just cannot believe that they're hardly the straightlaced serious folks that one would expect anyone to become after living under a hard regime all their lives.The film straddles between the present and the past allowing each man to recount their moment of glory on a world stage. Everyone had a sense of humour and this shows during their interviews being extremely free with their words and candid in their responses quite contrary to what one would expect with minders probably being close by nodding in approval at what was mentioned but it's not the case. In many ways Dan Gordon's film will open up many eyes that politics aside they too are human beings with the same hopes and dreams with experience to share and the desire to do so with fellow friends no matter what political system they live under. And you can't help but to chuckle at how confused these guys were when they finally made that leap into democracies during their tour of duty which on one hand they're pretty focused on their mission and on the other in awe at the frenzy happening around them.This film can also be deemed as a football film in a certain sense since it had archived a slice of qualifying action for that sole OceaniaAfricaAsian spot in the World Cup finals of 16 teams then. The 1966 World Cup will always be remembered for a few things and for football fans this film presents and showcases some of those aspects in a year where England hoisted its only World Cup trophy to date and on home soil too. For those who are familiar with footballing legends then this film offered us a glimpse of the 1965 minted European footballer of the year and top scorer of the tournament in Portugal's Eusebio. You'll also bear witness to how the rules of the sport had evolved as back then substitutes were not allowed.But like most sports too there's always this deep affinity with the underdogs and the North Korean team being the representative of Oceania Africa and Asia had its work cut out for them. And probably their success in making up for their lack of technical skills with fitness speed and energy to chase down every ball though lacking accuracy up front to make it count for something. Their Chollima mindset and swelling of pride not to let their fatherland down that neversaydie attitude could have also endeared the team to many fans in Britain especially the Middlesbrough folks who have adopted the team as their own. And the neverending debate on teamwork versus individual flair cannot be more keenly defined when witnessing how through teamwork the North Koreans have overcome opponents though thanks to the Portuguese's Eusebio he had single handedly through conscious bodylanguage. turned the tide in a riveting match that the filmmakers had managed to condense into a tense finish.The film also tries to insert statements whenever it can on how the role of sports can be used to promote harmony and goodwill in building bridges and strengthening ties and cutting through politics and the sore memories of war between those who were fighting on opposite sides a decade ago. But I guess the true value here is that peek behind the iron curtain and for footballing fans an extremely well made documentary that brings a blast from the past in one of the World Cup's defining moments.".

Absolutely nothing! The premise and narrative is formulaic for this kind of feel good carpe diem shows  a bunch of misfits are thrown together by circumstance to escape the dread of make up Math lessons during the holidays they enroll not voluntarily at first to form a Big Band face the great uphill task of getting funds for instruments rehearsing and getting their act together before ending it all with a cheery big bang.But as always it's the delivery that matters. And this show delivers at all fronts. From the many comedic and zany moments to preaching never give ups the story is breezy and the pacing comfortable. The main leads are rock solid good lookers while the supporting casts consists of quirky characters like the rocker chicks huh? in a jazz band?! watch to find out! gangsterish mechanic wimps and a teachermaestro wannabe brings much laughter even though at times their characters might seem one dimensional.What works is definitely the chemistry amongst the cast. It seems from the out takes that they had tremendous fun in making this film and it shows in the end product.One gripe you may have about this film is that the band when they finally get their act together always seem to play the same old piece when you're craving for more. Well that's what made the finale work by building the expectation then surpassing it  it's 15 minutes of pure musical splendor and it really made me wanna stand up from my seat and swing along. Too bad I didn't do that cos I know the entire audience might just join along with me! So if you're feeling down and somewhat bored give this movie a go and I'd guarantee you'll be swinging and jazzing along when you emerge from the theatre craving for more.".

Everything is so delightfully predictable that you needn't waste time trying to unravel it. Instead you just sit back and enjoy the presentation.The humour is largely visual but it's not corny or slapstick. It's hard to describeperhaps I'd categorize it with Monty Python's deadpan style subtle and classy while not being afraid to make fun of itself. And this movie definitely makes fun of itself like in the scene where the kids are running from a ferocious wild boar which is quite plainly a stuffed prop. Juxtapose the bizarrely inappropriate Louis Armstrong tune What a Wonderful World on top and you have yourself 3 solid minutes of asphyxiating laughter.Now comedy aside it's important that you know something about the music. These kids are actually playing their own instruments. The fingering and breathing technique is authentic right down to the last flubbed note. I think this is worthy of mention because it adds a certain authenticity to the film much like in SPINAL TAP. Not only are they acting they're really playing too.Let me finish by saying that YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE SWING MUSIC to enjoy this film. Me I'm a fan of death metal. But by the end of this film and for some time thereafter I sure as heck found myself whistling Take the 'A' Train. Can't get the bloody tune out of my head now.".

The girls learn jazz going through the usual learning curves. The success or failure of this film hinges upon whether you like the characters and I do. They are not caricatures not over the top just girls who want to play jazz. Another thing I liked a lot was that the film doesn't have any soppy coming of age romance subplots which would retract from the fun of this.

Therefore she envies the members of the school's brass band who gets to travel with the baseball team. However on this particular hot summer day the band's bus leaves before the caterer arrives with the band's lunches. Because the caterer has another delivery Tomoko along with the other girls in the class decide to deliver the lunches.

The girls eventually begin to enjoy playing their instruments but right before the big game the brass bands members regain their strength and perform instead of the girls. However seeds of love for music have been planted in the hearts of the saxophonist Tomoko the trumpeter Saito Yoshie the trombonist Sekiguchi and the drummer Tanaka Naomi and while the other girls quit in order to hang out with some boys this little group with Nakamura in tow sets forth to start their own jazz band.Before actually watching this film my only knowledge concerning it was that it was directed by the director of Waterboys but having yet to watch that film this left me with little information for what to expect. However I received the experience of watching a very enjoyable film that was without violence unless you count snowball fights and Naomi's butt cracking the head of a wild boar when the girls go matsutake hunting without angst without hormonal frustration etc. The young actresses have a wonderful chemistry and seem like actual friends instead of actresses. Also the personalities of Tomoko Nakamura Yoshie Sekiguchi and Naomi are very well fleshed out and each one of them has their own personal quirks Yoshie's falls for every cute boy she sees the mild Sekiguchi excels at whatever she does but is ignored by those around her and the deadpan Naomi has a wonderful dry sense of humor. Combine all of this with a truly outstanding performance at the end of the film the girls later on went to perform in New York and Los Angeles make for a very nice film watching experience.".

Tomoko is a typical high school student who along with her classmates one summer day delivers lunch to members of the brass band playing at a baseball tournament. But because the food has been out in the summer heat the band members get food poisoning and Tomoko and her friends have to substitute for bedridden brass band. The girls start practicing instruments and at first aren't very serious about it but they gradually come to enjoy themselves and their lives are changed. In this process they get together and learn friendship and love and the audience has the chance to watch them grow.This director is of the film is Fumiharu Yaguchi who most famous work is the popular Water Boys a film about male high school students who start a synchronized swimming team. So Swing Girls and Water Boys are alike in that ordinary students succeed in the end. The cast of Swing Girls consists of 16 girls and 1 boy lead ably by Juri Ueno in the role of Tomoko. One of Japan more popular actors Naoto Takenaka does another fine job playing the part of the powerless teacher.One of the best things about Swing Girls is that the cast really play their own instruments. Most had no experience playing so they practiced very hard for three months. These authentic performances help convey the pleasure of simply played music. It seems the instruments used in the film sold at very high prices after this movie was released.On the negative side there are some scenes that seem impossible. For example some students suddenly are able to play their instrument very well without any practice. In the scene in which the students are chased by a wild boar no one is ever caught or injured. If these scenes were made more realistic I think this movie could be any even more wonderful work.".

	schema:reviewBody "Set in a remote country high school in the region of Tohoku SWING GIRLS is the story about the struggle of a group of girls with a passion for jazz that brings laughter and tears. The girls begin practicing music on the pretext of skipping summer makeup lessons. At first they are not enthusiastic but as they learn little by little to make sounds they become gradually fascinated by jazz. They make up their minds to form a big band by themselves but they have no instruments money or places to practice. They then get parttime jobs to finance their band but nearly all result in failure and they face a crisis of a breakup of band. But with their passion for jazz and their cheerfulness they manage to stay to together and to take part in a music festival at which they give a rousing performance in the film last scene. Besides mastering their instruments the girls also grow mentally and learn to carry out a project to its end.The director of this movie is Shinobu Yaguchi director of the hit film WATER BOYS. He seems to like to make this kind of story. The basic theme of both movies is the same poorly motivated students learn to succeed. As WATER BOYS was the first of its kind the image of WATER BOYS is apt to go ahead of SWING GIRLS. Even if characters turn from boys to girls and the subject turns from sport to music SWING GIRLS may be regarded as only imitation of WATER BOYS. However the praiseworthy thing in Yaguchi movies is that actors and actresses themselves actually perform on screen. In SWING GIRLS the actresses underwent very hard training for to master their instruments in order to create a powerful and appealing performance.While I enjoyed this movie very much there are some unsatisfactory points. The development of story is too forced and too convenient. The process of mastering instruments is especially too sudden. It is hardly possible to acquire such great skills with such halfhearted and short practice. Mastering instruments is never easy and is accompanied by hardships and frustrations. I wanted to see this process and how joyful they are when they learn to play their instruments. It is disappointing that their efforts are not described.But in the face of the actresses' incredible cheerfulness and energy arguments about the quality of the story are meaningless. There are many attractions in this movie. Due to their provincial accents and natural ease at portraying students the actresses make the characters feel familiar and it is easy for us to empathize with them. The rural scenery such as the railroad running through rice paddies and wide spaces completely covered with snow creates a rich atmosphere. This movie is a very good entertainment and can serve to encourage us. I like to watch this movie again when I want to be cheered up.".

Besides mastering their instruments the girls also grow mentally and learn to carry out a project to its end.The director of this movie is Shinobu Yaguchi director of the hit film WATER BOYS. He seems to like to make this kind of story. The basic theme of both movies is the same poorly motivated students learn to succeed. As WATER BOYS was the first of its kind the image of WATER BOYS is apt to go ahead of SWING GIRLS. Even if characters turn from boys to girls and the subject turns from sport to music SWING GIRLS may be regarded as only imitation of WATER BOYS. However the praiseworthy thing in Yaguchi movies is that actors and actresses themselves actually perform on screen. In SWING GIRLS the actresses underwent very hard training for to master their instruments in order to create a powerful and appealing performance.While I enjoyed this movie very much there are some unsatisfactory points. The development of story is too forced and too convenient. The process of mastering instruments is especially too sudden. It is hardly possible to acquire such great skills with such halfhearted and short practice. Mastering instruments is never easy and is accompanied by hardships and frustrations. I wanted to see this process and how joyful they are when they learn to play their instruments. It is disappointing that their efforts are not described.But in the face of the actresses' incredible cheerfulness and energy arguments about the quality of the story are meaningless. There are many attractions in this movie. Due to their provincial accents and natural ease at portraying students the actresses make the characters feel familiar and it is easy for us to empathize with them. The rural scenery such as the railroad running through rice paddies and wide spaces completely covered with snow creates a rich atmosphere. This movie is a very good entertainment and can serve to encourage us. I like to watch this movie again when I want to be cheered up.";

But when the regulars manage to recover sooner than expected the backup girls fake a sigh of relieve but soon find that they have fallen in love with music. While most soon get sidetracked four of them love the music so much that they form the Swing Girls. This comprises a sax player the main character next to the music that is and not surprisingly the prettiest one a bespectacled timid trombone player a girl who needs the sight of a rat to hit the high note on the trumpet the obvious clown of the lot and the slightly overweighed drummer. Added to them are two wildlooking electric guitar players who would want to be anywhere where music is played and a guy on the keyboard. It takes the group a while to find their rhythm with jazz until the melody of Coming through the rye from a traffic light gives them the magical inspiration they need. The rest of the girls now come back to join them.There are anecdotes and other characters aplenty along the way some funny some banal but the movie never wavers from the theme which is the group's love of music. The ending is appropriately uplifting when the band finally gets a chance to do its thing in a national high school competition. Winning is not even important only finding of an appreciative audience. All the characters in the movie are well likable and there is everpopular Naoto Takenaka. As the end credit rolls we see the names of the cast the way they would appear in a programme of an orchestral concert grouped under the sections of instruments they play. The girls and one guy actually performed themselves and the success of the intensive training they received before the shooting of the movie is quite evident. Altogether a sweet little film that will be loved by all who love music.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sean Bean returns as the ever intrepid Richard Sharpe in this latest reworking of Bernard Cornwell's earlier books. Shot on 35mm this film and the previous film from a few years earlier Peril has z different look and feel to it but regardless we get to see Sharpe's continued exploits and share in his adventures. The production values are higher than ever. The Indian productions seem to have been taken up a notch or two from the films shot in the 90s. Sun drenched scenery both plush and arid they're a far cry from the relatively frigid realms of the winter locations in Spain and Portugal. For whatever reason the direction feels a little different as well but ironically enough seems to hearken back to the feeling that the earlier Sharpe films gave the audience. There's a sense of adventure intrigue and the exotic as well as the romantic.Sharpe is presented with some internal challenges as well as a plethora of external ones. Teresa though long gone since the fourth film is still very much alive in Sharpe's memory. To find out why you have to see the film.If I had one critique it's that Sen Bean being a smoker has aged prematurely. Oh sure he's old but his smoking habit doesn't help sell him as the dashing hero type. He looks ragged which ironically enough actually helps accentuate the character. Still it would behoove him to toss the cigarettes and add some years to his life.Still it's a solid installment. A bit longer than usual and it does take liberties with some of the characters but it's a decent watch.Give it a whirl and enjoy.".

Shot on 35mm this film and the previous film from a few years earlier Peril has z different look and feel to it but regardless we get to see Sharpe's continued exploits and share in his adventures. The production values are higher than ever. The Indian productions seem to have been taken up a notch or two from the films shot in the 90s. Sun drenched scenery both plush and arid they're a far cry from the relatively frigid realms of the winter locations in Spain and Portugal. For whatever reason the direction feels a little different as well but ironically enough seems to hearken back to the feeling that the earlier Sharpe films gave the audience. There's a sense of adventure intrigue and the exotic as well as the romantic.Sharpe is presented with some internal challenges as well as a plethora of external ones. Teresa though long gone since the fourth film is still very much alive in Sharpe's memory. To find out why you have to see the film.If I had one critique it's that Sen Bean being a smoker has aged prematurely. Oh sure he's old but his smoking habit doesn't help sell him as the dashing hero type. He looks ragged which ironically enough actually helps accentuate the character. Still it would behoove him to toss the cigarettes and add some years to his life.Still it's a solid installment. A bit longer than usual and it does take liberties with some of the characters but it's a decent watch.Give it a whirl and enjoy.";

	schema:reviewBody "While not quite as romantic as the previous feature film SHARPE'S CHALLENGE this actionpacked adventure is a wonderful farewell to the bad boy English rifleman and his colorful friends and enemies. Personally I would have ended the series at the end of SHARPE'S CHALLENGE when Sharpe has the opportunity to marry a loyal courageous and truly stunning general's daughter and become a general himself in the famed East India Company. But instead Sharpe is just trying to get home and he is roped into escorting a spoiled French beauty through the Indian countryside and villains are after her and one thing just leads to another till pretty soon Sharpe is like Moses leading dozens of castaways in search of safety and a new beginning. Where CHALLENGE had the feeling of an Arabian Nights adventure with most of the action among Indian palaces and Royalty PERIL is more rugged and down to earth with a virtual wagon train journeying through hostile territory like an old fashioned American Western. There are battles every ten minutes and sword fights every five minutes. Sharpe's followers include a lot of Western types familiar from movies like STAGECOACH and MAJOR DUNDEE. The useless missionary the plucky pregnant woman the loyal Indian companion the drunken or lazy troopers all have their parts to play. What lifts the story above Western territory however is the way in which Sharpe himself is forced to look for closure to his personal dramas. Some of his most deadly enemies reappear or their sons do and there are some unexpected discoveries on all sides. The most poignant scenes in the story all revolve around Sharpe coming to terms with past regrets and resolving conflicts. All of it was wonderful even if Sharpe's French blonde love interest in PERIL isn't quite as demure or winning as English blonde love interest in CHALLENGE. But both movies are Sharpe classics both great farewells to a true hero!".

	schema:reviewBody "I gave this a 7 rating because it was Sharpe but I really have to wonder why they bothered to make the last two films. Sharpe went out with a glorious bang in Sharpe's Waterloo and it should have remained that way. Instead two films set 3 years after Waterloo were made about 10 years after with a dashingly athletic star showing the ravages of a cigarettes and beer diet. To add insult to injury whereas the younger Sharpe was usually clean shaven and his hair while tousled was relatively shinythe 'three years older' Sharpe was unkempt unshaven and his hair looked like a badly hacked horse hair wig. Gone was the virile handsome superstud who made the ladie's hearts beat faster. We are asked to accept that three years later was a middle aged man resembling a hasbeen pugilist with a drinking problem.OK that is a petty quibble but it does lead to more questions. As the India films were not from the books but independently scripted based on earlier Sharpe novels and given the actors natural aging why did they not set them at least 10 to 15 years after Waterloo? The British were still in India and Sharpe by then would be in his late 40's or early 50's.Another point to ponder from watching the 'making of' documentary was why did they film it in such a dreary part of India which they kept telling us was in the middle of nowhere with the scorching temperatures of MarchApril causing the actors to suffer in their heavy woolen costumes. Why then did they not find a location in the hills where it would have been cooler and the scenery more attractive? British India was concentrated in the North West region which borders modern Pakistan. Why have the actors dressed in heavy wool uniforms when they could have been made from brushed cotton which would have been more comfortable and would have looked authentic on film? I grant that the outdoor scenes would have been uncomfortable but surely the indoor scenes could have been filmed in an airconditioned studio in Mumbai.I could go on picking apart the decisions but overall I feel that Sharpe's Challenge and Sharpe's Peril were an attempt to milk the the cow until it ran dry and an unforgettable series should have been left to stand alone.".

On British TV the programme was shown in two parts the first of which dragged though there was some reasonable action in the second. I suspect that the influence of Sharpe author Bernard Cornwell was confined to providing the characters because the plot borrowed countless clichs from Westerns of the 1950s. There were several insults to one's intelligence.The most notable was Sharpe's supposedly inspirational speech to the soldiers and villagers as they awaited the final onslaught by the baddies. The references to Napoleon and Waterloo would have meant something to the few remaining British soldiers but nothing at all to the Indian troops and villagers  even supposing they the latter especially understood English. Then there was Harper curiously being cured of kidney stones and Simmerson's remarkable recovery from delirium and his sudden warmth for Sharpe and where did he get his smart general's uniform from after the pursued soldiers and civilians had been carrying next to nothing after crossing the river. The portrait of Sharpe's daughter in the locket looked more like a colour photograph than a painting.Sean Bean was beginning to show his age seemed to go through the motions with his acting and was not at all an inspiring leader.".

Then there was Harper curiously being cured of kidney stones and Simmerson's remarkable recovery from delirium and his sudden warmth for Sharpe and where did he get his smart general's uniform from after the pursued soldiers and civilians had been carrying next to nothing after crossing the river. The portrait of Sharpe's daughter in the locket looked more like a colour photograph than a painting.Sean Bean was beginning to show his age seemed to go through the motions with his acting and was not at all an inspiring leader.";

That in and of itself weakens the whole premise of Sharpe as a character and as a show.It's hokey here and there. The whole long lost brother bit is silly as hell and the only surprises here with it are that they used it at alland that it takes Sharpe so long to figure it out. Also weak beyond belief are Mrs. Sharpe and her paramour Lord Rossindale who both came right out of Central Casting and aren't acted well enough to bring anything but the cardboard cutouts. Finally while Sharpe episodes aren't known for subtlety Justice goes way overboard with the blackandwhite goodandbad. There's no middle ground here Either a character is Good or heshe is Evil.Still and all there's good here too. Sean Bean created Richard Sharpe and he's got the character down pat. Everything is right about his performance. Minus the constant battles of the earlier episodes his character is developed and exposed in a way we've never seen before. Also excellent is the eternal sidekick Sgt. Harper. There's more camaraderie between the two than ever before and it's quite nice. Even Daniel the singer gets good screen time and decent attention paid to him for the first time in the series his momentary disloyalty and later apology show us how worthwhile his character might've been over three seasons if he'd ever gotten the chance.It allepisode and seriesends with Sharpe off to Normandy and Lucille Harper off to Ireland where's Ramona? and Daniel staying with the locals in Yorkshire because he's got no place else to go.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERNot adapted from one of Cornwell's books  as far as i know anyway!  And boy does it show!  It really wasn't in Sharpe's character to go delving into his past but he goes ahead and does it anyway.  The inclusion of the long lost brother plot is a little trite but it is quite nice  it emphasises how strong the bond between Sharpe and chosen men is.  It was also nice to see more of Hagman who is criminally underused in the series often seemingly included only to perpetrate some folk singing.  Once again Jane is completely bonkers but Rossendale puts in a good performance as the man completely besotted by the scheming minx and feeling a little guilty about the betrayal of the gallant Major Sharpe.

It really wasn't in Sharpe's character to go delving into his past but he goes ahead and does it anyway.  The inclusion of the long lost brother plot is a little trite but it is quite nice  it emphasises how strong the bond between Sharpe and chosen men is.  It was also nice to see more of Hagman who is criminally underused in the series often seemingly included only to perpetrate some folk singing.  Once again Jane is completely bonkers but Rossendale puts in a good performance as the man completely besotted by the scheming minx and feeling a little guilty about the betrayal of the gallant Major Sharpe.  The scene in the square was a little chilling a precursor to the Peterloo massacre that took place not long after.

I'm tremendously sorry to see it end and would love to see more.The producers stretched their TV budget to the limit in order to mount convincing battle scenes for the finale with considerable success although this series will never rival a Hollywood studio production. We are given enough information about Waterloo to appreciate the dramatic events and feel very much in the middle of the fighting. Sharpe is in fine form as are Harper Harris Hagman Wellington Lucille Jane and Lord Rossendale who are all present along with a slew of guest stars and faces from earlier in the series. Rossendale in particular gets a share of the spotlight and his character is developed in unexpected ways. The central plot device is that Sharpe has returned to the army and been assigned to the staff of Prince William of the Netherlands but becomes disenchanted with the prince's incompetence and roams the battlefield saving the day hither and yon. It works.I won't comment on the central issue of what becomes of Sharpe at the end except to say that there is a very moving and intelligent resolution of his military career.The only negatives are First with so much action so many characters and so many stories being concluded the whole thing sometimes seems a bit dizzy. Second the British accents are often very tough for American ears to decipher and important dialogue and plot points can be missed. This is a problem with the Sharpe series as a whole but here with so much shouting and guns blazing in the background the problem is magnified. There is one shot of Jane Sharpe in a negligee that is nothing less than aweinspiring.Highly recommended as is the whole series. The Sharpe series will remind you at various times of War and Peace For Whom the Bell Tolls the Horatio Hornblower stories Vanity Fair The Dirty Dozen The Red Badge of Courage and All Quiet on the Western Front.P.S.  I can't help being puzzled at the overthetop reactions to my comment about the British accents. I have no complaint about the accents any more than I'd have a complaint about a character speaking French in a Truffaut film so there's no need for outrage.

	schema:reviewBody "It was always going to end like this. After four years and thirteen movies battling all over France and Spain it was inevitable that Richard Sharpe and the chosen men would find themselves fighting at Waterloo one of the most famous battles in military history. Given that the previous two episodes had been a bit lacklustre the pressure to give Sharpe a good send off must have been tremendous but they needn't have worried as Sharpe's Waterloo is a glorious culmination to the initial run.Considering what an epic clash Waterloo was all that needed to be done for this particular film was take the familiar characters and drop them into the thick of it and by and large that's what they do but that isn't to say there's no storyline here. Promoted to Colonel Sharpe comes face to face with his treacherous wife Jane and her lover the pathetic Lord Rossendale once more. Tempers flaring Sharpe demands his money back and soon Jane is plotting to have Rossendale kill him in the confusion of the coming battle. At the same time Sharpe must deal with his new commanding officer the inept Prince of Orange who seems determined to pay no attention to advice whatsoever. And the armies of Napoleon are marching ever closer.Okay it might not be the most indepth narrative but nevertheless it delivers on everything you'd expect from a Sharpe movie. The officer class who disapprove of Sharpe are toffee nosed imbeciles all Abigail Cruttenden's heaving breasts appear to have become even larger and nearly half the episode is dedicated to the titanic battle itself. Come to think of it the only ingredient missing is a woman in peril...All of this talk though is just window dressing for what is the chief appeal of this chapter the battle of Waterloo itself. The production team had worked wonders with their limited budget before but they outdo themselves on this one.

	onyx:emotionText "It was always going to end like this. After four years and thirteen movies battling all over France and Spain it was inevitable that Richard Sharpe and the chosen men would find themselves fighting at Waterloo one of the most famous battles in military history. Given that the previous two episodes had been a bit lacklustre the pressure to give Sharpe a good send off must have been tremendous but they needn't have worried as Sharpe's Waterloo is a glorious culmination to the initial run.Considering what an epic clash Waterloo was all that needed to be done for this particular film was take the familiar characters and drop them into the thick of it and by and large that's what they do but that isn't to say there's no storyline here. Promoted to Colonel Sharpe comes face to face with his treacherous wife Jane and her lover the pathetic Lord Rossendale once more. Tempers flaring Sharpe demands his money back and soon Jane is plotting to have Rossendale kill him in the confusion of the coming battle. At the same time Sharpe must deal with his new commanding officer the inept Prince of Orange who seems determined to pay no attention to advice whatsoever. And the armies of Napoleon are marching ever closer.Okay it might not be the most indepth narrative but nevertheless it delivers on everything you'd expect from a Sharpe movie. The officer class who disapprove of Sharpe are toffee nosed imbeciles all Abigail Cruttenden's heaving breasts appear to have become even larger and nearly half the episode is dedicated to the titanic battle itself. Come to think of it the only ingredient missing is a woman in peril...All of this talk though is just window dressing for what is the chief appeal of this chapter the battle of Waterloo itself. The production team had worked wonders with their limited budget before but they outdo themselves on this one. You might not see thousands of men massacring each other on the killing fields but nevertheless there is a tremendous sense of scale this time around. The skirmishers clash in rifle exchanges in the woods before withdrawing to their main regiment for some bloody brawls around farmhouses. Gun smoke drifts across the field shells explode amid packed formations to tear men to pieces bodies fly from rooftops and massive French marauders swing axes into the fray giving the carnage a sense of total chaos.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one Sharpe that I failed to see on TV when it first came out. And when I finally did see it I had mixed feelings about it. The film is a kind of reunion and last hurrah for Sharpe and what remains of his riflemen. The pros are of course the reunion of characters that we've come to know through the series of films one of Sharpe's major subplots sees a resolution and for good or ill we see the fates of our riflemen.The film itself is rather kludged together. It feels like a patchwork and the filmed story not the actual story but the shots themselves totter on be incoherent at times as well as some of the actions of the characters. My guess is that the production team were trying to wind up the film series as best they could but in the end all they wind up doing is confusing the viewer with some incoherent actions on the part of the main characters.That and the battle of Waterloo is never fully realized. Considering that this is a made for TV movie and one that has the limitations of a UK budget no less it's no wonder things are a bit scaled down. We're told references to engagements by the characters here and there as they point to one clump of soldiers and then to another. That's not really a big deal. What is a big deal is that we never see the soldiers maneuvering like they're supposed to be. Again this isn't Sergey Bondarchuk Waterloo with tens of thousands of cheap Soviet soldiers to act as extras but ITV's version of the same battle on a shoestring budget. That's not really a big deal. But what is a big deal is that the Sharpe production team did need at least a couple hundred more people in costume to really fake the size of the armies. But we can kind of get over that.What I can't get over is that I'm a huge fan of the film series have read a few of the books and am at a loss as to what the story in this film is all about. Sharpe actually meanders here and there for no rhyme or reason and we the audience are left scratching our heads. Certainly not a fault of the excellent thesping going on here because all the actors hold their own and gives us excellent performances. If fault were to lie somewhere then it's with both the screenplay artist and director probably more the latter than the former.The final scene and final shot are perhaps how the series should have ended which it didn't and is a nice segue into rewatching the films all over again but the meat of the film could stand to use some tweaking. An interesting project would be to go back and insert scenes with soldiers or to digitally add more soldiers here and there to really add size and scope to this production. Even so that's not going to counter for a weak story.It's not a film I'd recommend even for Sharpe fans but like the infamous third season of 1960's Star Trek it is what it is and isn't all that bad I suppose.Give it a shot and judge for yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "A great ending to the Richard Sharpe series. I am an enormous fan of the books by Bernard Cornwell and I have read all 20 of them. I have also seen some of the episodes Waterloo among them. Sean Bean is without doubt an amazing and talented actor and Daragh O' Malley is the perfect sidekick. John Tams as Hagman is my favorite rifleman besides Sharpe and Harper episode and book.Some minor things though. Waterloo would have made a ten out of ten had it been more like the book and more specific on some of the characters' fates.The episode is awesome but in some scenes they would have made it look better had they involved more men as in more soldiers and battalions. But that is only a small thing. Another thing is that they wrapped up a few things without too much detail. For example spoiler when the Prince is shot they made it look as if he had died. Not true though. In the book and in reality he was only wounded. Also they could have put in the details from the book of Sharpe being approached saying that Rossendale had died and Jane was waiting for the news about the battle. Sharpe laughs sourly saying he wont be the one to tell because he doesn't give a dime about her. That would have confirmed the fate of Jane better and the Prince's.All that aside this is an incredible episode and I recommend it to all who are wondering whether Sharpe is worth it.".

	schema:headline " Degrades the brave men who fought at Waterloo";
	schema:reviewBody "Rather than focusing upon one of the most significant battles in history Cornwell's purpose seems to be to degrade the memory of the men who fought at Waterloo.Much of this episode is dedicated to disparaging the man who would later become king William II of Holland. The opening scene shows him with a prostitute and an ugly boil on his rear. Later William's Dutch cavalry at Quatre Bras are portrayed as cowardly and refusing to charge when ordered to do so. Cornwell gives William the nickname Silly Billy and portrays him as being a arrogant fool but in reality William's courage and good nature made him very popular with the British who nicknamed him Slender Billy.The age 23 Prince William is shown as being responsible for losing the La Haye Sainte farm and the death of two of Sharpe's men. The fact is William wasn't even in the farm when it was taken about 6 PM. The farm was mostly burned by Napoleon's artillery and the area taken after an extremely fierce struggle. Sharpe is shown shooting William to get him off the battlefield with MacDuff looking on from a wooden roof window at La Haye Sainte but the French had just taken La Haye Sainte and in reality all the wooden buildings at the farm were burned by the time the French occupied the area. William was actually wounded about a half hour later in a courageous but futile attempt to take back La Haye Sainte.Cornwell and Clegg have Wellington say humbug five times in about 3 minutes. Although it is true Welington did say something like that but not to Sharpe it seems Cornwell wanted to overemphasize that Wellington had been surprised by the speed of Napoleon's advance by having him repeat it no less than FIVE times and sound foolish. Later at the critical moment when the Imperial Guard was approaching the Allied lines Sharpe makes the decision for the men who had been laying low on the ground to fire. The person who really gave the order at that moment was the allied commander Wellington. They also portray as a pathetic coward Wellington's relative who recorded the times of the events of the battle. In reality he was at the forefront of the battle facing the field and was eventually killed by cannon fire. Typical of Cornwell he does not portray Lord Uxbridge as courageous despite the fact that at a critical time in the battle at 230 PM he led a charge that stopped a French advance. Uxbridge was extremely brave he had eight or nine horses shot from under him during the Battle of Waterloo and eventually lost a leg. But Cornwell for some reason usually portrays real historical leaders in a negative way. And Cornwell and Clegg's portrayal of the very brave Frenchmen that day is also demeaning. He has Sharpe repeatedly refer to them as frogs and portrays them as slow marching rigid easy targets even the Imperial Guard considered the finest troops in Europe at the time. Several times the episode shows French troops marching into fire without even trying to shoot back. On a positive note the costumes locations and sets were very good although what they show as La Haye Sainte looks more like the Hougoumont Chteau on Napoleon's left side with the larger stone wall and the more extensive woods nearby. The initial battle at La Haye Sainte in the episode looks more like the historical description of the fighting at Hougoumont. A book that covers the details of the Battle of Waterloo is 24 Hours at Waterloo by Robert Kershaw.".

It is also nice to see that the other officers listen to him when they are talking about strategy. It seems that he finally has gotten the respect he deserves.

Very strange to see that they let him command his army even when it is obvious his own subordinates laugh at him because he is completely incompetent. Lord Wellington was forced to make use of foreign allies since most of the British were sent out to the colonies. I bet the indigenous people would not have mind them returning to Europe. That is the reason why they didn't object to Silly Billy being put in command of his Dutch army. I don't know if this historically is correct. But like most things in the Sharpe series it is about adventure and action. The historical accuracy is a bonus. Prince William is the direct cause of the death of Hagman and Harris when he orders them to open the gate so he can escape. Their death really got to me because I liked them very much. That is what happens when you follow a series like this. You get to know them well and then when something happens it affects you. I loved the reaction from Sharpe when he hears about their death and the cause. I also liked how they left the ending open. Usually I am against these kinds of ending but in this case it was fitting. It made we wonder what had become of Sharpe and is an invite to future adventures. There were two episodes  films that came after. Not as good as the original ones but still decent. I hope that rather sooner than later they will make more. This undoubtedly is one of the best series that has graced the small screen. And if you have not seen it by now you should.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers ahoy...This last major Sharpe episode in the original block of series ties things up nicely and given the limited TV budget does a neat job of portraying Waterloo. Best of all for those of us who've grown to hate Jane Sharpe it provides a satisfying end with Sharpe not responsible for her downfall but she having a disaster none the less. However...The book tries not to fall into the trap of having Sharpe basically win the battle but as usual the TV series has him practically doing so despite the fact plain and simple that in a fit of anger at the incompetent command of the Dutch prince William he leaves the field and abandons his men at a crucial stronghold and a crucial point. I can't imagine Sharpe going so far nor Wellington sparing him after the battle. The French for once are allowed to fight fairly well not being gunned down by the dozen by Sharpe's chosen but would it have been so hard to admit that the battle was nearly lost at the farmhouse Sharpe and his men had been holding? Perhaps this relates to Sharpe's abandoning the place...It would look bad if the hero were shown to have nearly caused the loss of Waterloo in a hissy fit. While kudos to the series producers and director for being willing to show Sharpe shooting a superior officer he believes is killing his men it would have been equally courageous for Sharpe to realize his lack of restraint nearly cost the battle. Sad to see two of Sharpe's last faithful chosen men killed after surviving so much. Nice to finally in this episode see Harper remembering that he has a wife after he'd seemed to have forgotten her in the last two and although he joins in the battle he pulls out soon as he's convinced the victory is won and he's had his peek at Boney.".

Because it didn't had reused TV opening and closing. The animation and CG is very well done for this film. The cast of characters along with the main are interesting and well thought up. The story had a fast pace to it so it didn't had any dull moment to it. But since it's One Piece it's meant to be as entertaining as the TV series itself. Plus the montage ending features characters who appear later in the series.Overall a worthy sequel that all One Piece Fan will admire.

	schema:reviewBody "Rich but eccentric millionaire Steven Price is looking for the ultimate scares.  He invites a group of people to spend the night in the former Vannacutt Psychiatric Institute for the Criminally Insane  where the inmates revolved in a orgy of violence against the cruel regime of Dr Vannacutt.  The one who does spend the night will get 1million dollars. However it soon becomes evident that not all the scares are set up by Price himself.This remake of the old 1958 movie sees the plot expanded and made a lot more creepy and enjoyable.  In fact the end point of the original is only the halfway mark of this one.  The plot may not be imaginative but the delivery is very good for this type of film.  I'm not a big fan of horror or this type of Hollywood slasher movie as I find them too obvious and not scary. However here the gore is well used and the general creepy mood wins the film.  The movement of the deceased Dr Vannacutt is very creepy and is much better than some of the gore.Sadly the final 20 minutes feels it needs to reveal a bigger evil and the secrets of the house are brought to life in boom of CGI beasties.  At this point it reverts to form and because just another Hollywood creature feature and it is a bit of a let down.  However up to this point it works very well and it's real creepy.The cast are all pretty good and do camp' when necessary but don't take away from the terror that's coming later.  Rush plays nicely to the camp in his homage to Price's role in the original.  Jensen Diggs Gallagher and Kattan all do well and the cast do better than the scream queens that usual inhabit these films.Overall the film starts like any other Hollywood horror but the clever direction creepy music and imaginative visuals of Dr Vannacutt all create a creepy feel to the film that is better than the gore that also comes.  The final section slides back into standard fare with the old CGI evil coming to get us  but up till then it's surprisingly good stuff.".

There is a huge difference between a remake which statistically Hollywood tends to mess up more often than it succeeds and a reimagining where the Rulebook is thrown out the window and basically its No Holds Barred. This is a reimagining and as such it is really a lot of fun. It is one thing to make the jump from BW to colour. It is an entirely different order of magnitude to pump up your redo with hi tech special effects magic glasses that enable the characters to see what should not be seen and at the finale some sort of giant clockwork that you would otherwise expect to find in Dr. Who. This film was released at Halloween which means in effect that the studio was looking for a fast buck and not trying to produce THE MATRIX. I think they exceeded their own expectations. A great cast recognizable names and the wandering through the basement is very creepy and good scary fun.".

I'm not sure  maybe it is the normality of being like those that are insane which brings a more genuine horror  to us.  Whatever it is House on Haunted Hill certainly uses all the mental derangement cliches to full effect.  I could easily pan this film by sayingand rightly so that its predecessor the original House on Haunted Hill directed by William Castle is a far superior film.  That Castle's film was filled with better acting better timing and easily a better script.  But I liked this film which is not really a remake entirely.  It has many elements that are not in the first film  most of them centering around the mental aspect aforementioned.  The house in this film was once an asylum where people...thousands perhaps..were brutally butchered in the name of mental good health.  The house is scary.  Empty corridors large vast rooms incredible special effects all add to the frightening aspects of the film. The biggest problem with the film is that much of it just doesn't add up in terms of making sense of the plot.  The film fortunately is more special effects driven than plot driven and at least is able to deliver the goods in that arena.  The acting is pretty good with all the leads really doing quite a good job.  Geoffrey Rush gives his best Vincent Price impressionpencilthin mustache and all delivering lines with bravura gusto.  The other exceptional standout is Chris Kattan as Watson Pritchard. Kattan is just wonderful in the role showcasing his obvious talent.  As far as great horror films go...this film is adequate yet very thrilling exciting and entertaining.  If you are like me and love the old one...just look at this film as a totally different entity.

This gets a lot right with the atmosphere and setting on display which is pretty chilling throughout the film here as this comes from how well this one utilizes the house it its advantage. The long endless darkened hallways cramped treatment rooms and overall atmosphere of the disuse throughout with cobwebs and disrepair found here make for some really creepy elements along the way which set up the ghost action nicely. This one gets the better of creepy events happening in a creepy location as early scenes of them following the ghostly doppelganger all throughout the different rooms a fantastic encounter in the operating room where they're only visible on a video camera and the later scene of the group encountering the hidden experiment rooms where the ghosts' manage to trap them in their patient treatments which result in some bloody kills and tense scenes. Likewise the finale also manages to interject quite a bit of fun here by showcasing the thrilling chases around the basement the formation of the mass of spectral blob that holds the ghosts of the dead as well as the fun of the big chase around the house as the relentless race to get up the house before it swallows the remaining survivors is a fun incredibly actionpacked finale here. Along with the great gore and creepy backstory these here are enough for this one to hold off the few flaws here. The biggest issue here is the fact that this one really overdoes the bickering couple angle to the point of overkill not only making it questionable about why they're together but the fact that they continue to feel that way deep into the film it grows tiresome as well as prevents this from really buying into what's going on. It would've been a lot more credible had they stopped going at each other and bought into the truth. Finally this one really strains credibility with how it gets the group to the house which makes no sense at all about how a supernatural entity would be able to conduct business in that manner when it's overt display of powers in doing that mean it could've just killed them off without ever needing them o come into the house in the first place. However these are mostly minor points that don't hold this one down all that much.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.".

Within the first scene there is gore surgery on a wide awake man violence the inmates of the asylum break loose and attack the staff and nudity uniforms ripped open on the women.  This is crucial to the plot Hill House is not the same murder house from the original it's a former asylum for the criminally insane where torture and experimentations are done on the inmates.

Multimillionaire Steven Price is the name a nod to Vincent? played by Geoffrey Rush doing his best sideshow barker impersonationWilliams Castle impersonation and wife Famke Janssen are having a party in the restored former asylum.  The guest's trip to the house is still via several hearse and from this point much of the original plot is maintained.The part that bothered me about the arrival scene at the house  was the inappropriate song.  It set the wrong mood and I worried about what was going to be next. Thankfully the rest of the score except the end title was strictly orchestral and sent a nice dark mood to try to help to scare you. Applause to Don Davis.House does rely rather heavily on special effects as do all the current remakes.  Is it really better or worse for it? I think it adds and they didn't just redo the same show. It's spooky and a good Halloween movie and a dark theater is excellent for it's effect. I am sorry but there was nothing that I found really scary or horrifying.  Of course I haven't really been scared by a movie since I saw the Wolf Man 1941 with Lon Chaney jr in 1958.".

	schema:reviewBody "House on Haunted Hill my first rated R movie I saw in the theater huge deal since I was only 13 at the time. But anyways House on Haunted Hill is of course remake of the same title back in the day the original star of the movie was Vincent Price it was spooky and creepy the only problem? The original has some what lost it's effect it had on people don't get me wrong it's still an excellent film but compared to a lot of horror films of today it seems rather tame. So of course you know what that means Let's remake the story and add tons of computer CGI and gore! But was this remake really that bad? Actually I'd say that I did enjoy it it had good suspense and very grizzly images that will stay in your head. It's a pretty decent update of this chilling ghost story and never lets go.The film is set in an abandoned asylum where numerous murders were committed in the past. The head of the facility Dr. Richard B. Vannacutt performed grotesque experiments and medical procedures on the patients killing many in the process. The hospital was closed when some of the patients escaped killing almost the entire staff and burning the hospital. We then meet Evelyn a spoiled trophy wife and Steven Price an amusement park mogul with a wicked sense of humor each of whom would gladly kill the other. Evelyn fancies spectacular parties so Steven leases the house from the owner Watson Pritchett for his Halloween birthday bash. Evelyn gives Steven a guest list two pages long he shreds it to spite her and then creates one of his own. The five people who show up for the party Jennifer Jenzer Eddie Baker Melissa Margaret Marr Dr. Donald Blackburn and Pritchett himself  aren't the ones he invited. Neither Evelyn nor Steven know who they are. Despite this Price continues the party's theme offering a million dollars to anyone who stays in the house and survives until morning. Of course this isn't any easy task as the ghosts are about and ready for a bloody good time.While I would recommend for nostalgic reasons to stick to the original as it is a true classic I say that this remake is still worth the look. It's definitely worth it in the dark I can't tell how much this one scene frightened me beyond compare when the reporter is filming in the basement to get an idea of what the asylum was like and the ghosts only appear on camera she sees them torturing a patient and they look up at her and goosebumps are the least of your worries at this point. All in all this is a very decent remake compared to other sad remakes we had that year like The Haunting. But still I wonder what Vincent Price would say if he was able to see how they updated the story maybe even do his little rap Thriller style! You know I had to get that in.610".

He showed that he had charisma could act and has a GREAT body in previous flicks How Stella Got Her Groove Back GO The Wood.  So why does he give such a soso performance herehe's even worse in The Best Man.  Hopefully he'll start acting again...soon.  I also heard about lousy CGI effects in this movie.

The only weak part was a real stupid surprise at the end that comes out of nowhere. Other than that it worked.So this is a good scary horror film.  Worth shelling out full price at a cinemaDON'T wait for the video.  This works great in a dark theatre with excellent stereo soundit won't work on a TV.".

	schema:reviewBody "I won't go into a full review since there are countless others and they all say about the same thing which is that the movie is actually pretty good until the last 5 or 10 minutes and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys scary movies. It really has a nice mix of suspense horror gore and levity without overdoing it on any of those or with the special effects except for the ending. The score is also pretty good and I liked the use of Marilyn Manson's eerie remake of Sweet Dreams Are Made Of This. Unfortunately it wasn't enough for the filmmakers that the house just be evil or haunted... someone involved with the film decided the evil should have some sort of actual form. I think that was a very bad idea but it was a bad idea made much MUCH worse by some very cheesy fractalmirrored CGI effects. Maybe they blew their budget on the set and the actors quite possible and didn't have enough left over to properly give form to the evil with CGI so they just settled for what they could get. IMO it would've been much better if they'd never given any form to it at all. I gave this movie a rating of 7 in this review but I'd really give it a 6.5 if I could. If not for the horrible turn the movie takes in the last 10 minutes with the absurd mirrored fractal CGI effects I'd actually have given it a 7.5 to an 8. Everybody's comments about the ending are spot on.... it's just a huge let down.Btw that sun rising over the ocean at the end is a pretty big goof. The movie is set on the west coast where the sun SETS over the ocean.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL 1999 Starring Geoffrey Rush Famke Janssen Taye Diggs Chris Kattan Peter Gallagher and Bridgette Wilson Director William Malone   Running Time 96 minutes   Rated R for strong terror violence and gore language and brief nudityBy Blake FrenchIt's been such a long time since I have been truly terrified by a movie that is supposed to be scary. To my pleasant surprise however The House on Haunted Hill did scare me out of my wits at times. Curiously I find myself disliking the film because of the flawed characters and structure yet recommending it due to the enticing and thrilling material contained within the tensionfilled story line.The first thing I would like to do in reviewing The House on Haunted Hill is compare and contrast it with the milder horror flick released earlier this year called The Haunting. That film surprised America with an unexpected PG13 rating unlike the appropriately Rrated The House on Haunted Hill. Although The Haunting did work due to an intriguing story line it missed the fact that in order to please an audience attending a screamfeast it needs to do some experimenting with its atmosphere characters and antagonism so we know what we're up against. That film had little to no violent gory or shocking material only contained marginally passable psychological terror. That is the main reason why that very film directed by Jon De Bont didn't manage to become a memorable summer movie experience.Unlike The Haunting The House on Haunted Hill is not afraid to graphically pick off its characters one by one in a grizzly manor to provoke horrifying fright in an audience. It is great fun to predict who is going to be next to go and how they'll be murdered. Personally I've been longing for this kind of material for quite some time now.This film does however have a lot in common with The Haunting. For example both movies are shot in somewhat of an oldfashioned stylean effective characteristic.  Both offer quite a bit of scary material. But The House on Haunted Hill seems to be more of an ambitious if flawed thriller. The story centers on a clan of five strangers who each are offered one million dollars if they spend the night in a closeddown Psychiatric Institute that was massacred by its own patients after a rebellion in the 1930's. In charge of this whole arrangement a twisted and rich theme park owner Steven Price Geoffrey Rush and his wife Evelyn Famke Janssen who have been experiencing marital problems for some time now. They're throwing together this party for Price's birthday but when an elaborate and efficient security system traps them in weird events begin to occur. Things that may or may not be part of an intricate plan to induce money murder and survival.What or who is responsible the unusual assurances at the institute? How did the guest list of the party mysteriously alter itself? What is happening to everyone if this entire situation is a prank? Are these characters that stupid? What exactly is the instate haunted by? Why did the patients rebel in the 30's and not sooner? Their motives are clear but why wait so long to do something about the hell accruing because of their doctors? The House on Haunted Hill is not the movie to answer these questions. Neither is it the film educated enough to properly develop an explanation of the characters to us. Stephen Price is developed well in one of the film's first scenes. But for the rest of the characters each of them saying their name and what they do for a living doesn't quite cut it here. Because of this the movie's many plot and character twists aren't as effective as they should be because we don't know the characters to begin with. So if the movie tries to tell us that someone is not who they appear to be how are we supposed to believe itwe never really knew who they were from the beginning?Also to this film's dismay the direction is all over the wall here. William Malone does a good job of focusing on each of the scary elements but not on the characters. When they walk slowly down a dark deserted hallway they seem to get off focus of where they really are and the circumstances they are in. Also nearly crucifying the production there aren't any boundaries here. Seemingly anything and everything can happen. At least The Haunting had some guidelines of where reality is taken into account.The Psychiatric Institute is a perfect terrifying atmosphere for this movie to be placed in. The fact that the strange and seemingly dangerous occurrences could be part of Price's trickery or something else on that matter just strengthens the drama more and increase the line of raising tension. The filmmakers take advantage of most of the opportunities they receive to use the house's many dark hallways and creepy chambers. In particular there is a especially disturbing sequence in a chamber which is supposed to make an insane man sane or a sane man insane that produces such a horrifying perspective of a character's mind it is almost safe to say the filmmakers went too far over the edge here.I also find to my liking the film's performances which are creative and full of energy. Geoffrey Rush is a great stuck up fraud and he is able to accomplish much with his character due to his wonderfully fresh development unlike the other characters. Famke Janssen Deep Rising 1998 I also am surprised to enjoy in a sly conniving role. Taye Diggs can't really do much in this type of movie he is more fit in films like The Best Man or How Stella Got Her Groove Back but what he does seems underplayed. Who really stands out here is the always appealing Peter Gallagher who brings a hidden regularity to his character. But regardless of his character he doesn't scenesteal nor does he overact.The House on Haunted Hill may be a very flawed film but at lest it serves its purpose to provoke fear in an audience. It is a very close call for me recommending the film or not and a medium review is given. Someday I might regret my decision to warrant The House on Haunted Hill with a minor recommendation. But as of this day and age I feel obligated to.Brought to you by Warner Bros.".

When they walk slowly down a dark deserted hallway they seem to get off focus of where they really are and the circumstances they are in. Also nearly crucifying the production there aren't any boundaries here. Seemingly anything and everything can happen. At least The Haunting had some guidelines of where reality is taken into account.The Psychiatric Institute is a perfect terrifying atmosphere for this movie to be placed in. The fact that the strange and seemingly dangerous occurrences could be part of Price's trickery or something else on that matter just strengthens the drama more and increase the line of raising tension. The filmmakers take advantage of most of the opportunities they receive to use the house's many dark hallways and creepy chambers. In particular there is a especially disturbing sequence in a chamber which is supposed to make an insane man sane or a sane man insane that produces such a horrifying perspective of a character's mind it is almost safe to say the filmmakers went too far over the edge here.I also find to my liking the film's performances which are creative and full of energy. Geoffrey Rush is a great stuck up fraud and he is able to accomplish much with his character due to his wonderfully fresh development unlike the other characters. Famke Janssen Deep Rising 1998 I also am surprised to enjoy in a sly conniving role. Taye Diggs can't really do much in this type of movie he is more fit in films like The Best Man or How Stella Got Her Groove Back but what he does seems underplayed. Who really stands out here is the always appealing Peter Gallagher who brings a hidden regularity to his character. But regardless of his character he doesn't scenesteal nor does he overact.The House on Haunted Hill may be a very flawed film but at lest it serves its purpose to provoke fear in an audience. It is a very close call for me recommending the film or not and a medium review is given. Someday I might regret my decision to warrant The House on Haunted Hill with a minor recommendation. But as of this day and age I feel obligated to.Brought to you by Warner Bros.";

	schema:reviewBody "As far as remakes go I thought this was a pretty solid update. It kept to the spirit of the original but at the same time did its own thing. The acting worked well and I was actually surprised by the amount of gore it had. I didn't remember it being that gory when I first watched it. While it wasn't too gratuitous there was enough there to sate the gorehound in me. Overall it was a good blend of jump scare moments gore and a fairly solid story. One of the few things I didn't like about it was the constant flashing imagery. At times it made it hard to concentrate on what was going on and distracting. I adore the original. It's in my Top 3 favorite Vincent Price films. The fact I didn't feel like this was tarnishing the name of the original caught me a bit off guard. Looking back I wonder if maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it as much the first time I saw it. It was also around that time period when I was sick and tired of remake after remake coming out. I think I may have gone in with a bit of preconceived hatred before I even viewed it.I'm glad I threw it on and watched it. I really enjoyed it way more than I was expecting. It's far from perfect but it's a solid film that I'll watch again. With that being said I still don't think it's as good as the original. There was a lasting fun creepiness about that one that still holds up which I don't think this one quite delivers on the same level. My Rating 710".

	schema:headline " A Horror Ghost Train";
	schema:reviewBody "This remake of William Castle's cult horror from 1958 is a reasonably good update deliberately designed as something of a Ghost Train ride. It's fun and has creepy 20s flashbacks galore throws in plenty of blood and adds a plot twist or two to the original story.The plot concerns Geoffrey Rush's amusement park entrepreneur inviting a small number of guests he's never previously met to his wife's birthday party intending to host it in a disused asylum that was the scene of a terrible tragedy. However the couple hate each other with a passion and each may be planning to murder the other before the night is over. To add to the fun the guests who turn up were not the ones he invited though he has offered each a million dollars if they survive the night. It appears they are the descendants of those who died the first time around and now the house won't let them out...Rush's character Steven Price is surely a homage to good ol' Vincent of that ilk and superhero fans can enjoy the sight of Famke Janssen from XMen and Ali Larter from Heroes amongst the cast. The flashback sequences are excellent and appear to have had an influence on games like Bioshock and the old creepy crypts of the house are genuinely unsettling. House On Haunted Hill has excellent production design and it's always great to see Jeffry Combes show up as the sinister Doctor. There are flaws however. The characters are not particularly welldeveloped so we don't care what happens to most of them much and the story is very diffuse not focusing on anything in detail before moving on to the next set piece. But House isn't bad as horror remakes go  in fact it matches the original and is bound to keep the gore hounds happy. Recommended as good roller coaster ride.".

	schema:reviewBody "The similarities between William Castle's campy 1959 original and this typical Hollywood remake are kept to a minimum. We have the premise of 5 people who're offered a million  if they survive spending a night in 'the house' and Rush who brings tribute to Vincent Price who played the lead role in the original. Other than this Malone just follows the routine remakestandards meaning bigger louder and more spectacular. If you're not too harsh this actually is a pretty enjoyable movie and  at times  a successful mixture between an oldfashioned 'haunted house' chiller and a modern special effects playground. Thanks to some sort of miracle Malone managed to cast class actor Geoffrey Rush and a more than decent supportive cast. Rush is talented enough to make his performance of eccentric impresario Steven Price look like a homage to Vincent Price instead of doing a lame impersonation. To me however the absolute star of this film is Jeffrey Combs ReAnimator who plays the small role of the demented Dr. Vannacutt. As usual Combs' character is the cause of all horror and his grimaces are more diabolical then ever. He's an amazing horror icon and I simply can't get why he isn't enjoying an immortal successstatus. Until about 5 minutes before the ending the use of CGI is imaginative and not irritating at all. The finale is overly fake and kinda ruins the film. If you're not too demanding The House on Haunted Hill guarantees a lot of fun and a few scares. Definitely a better remake than Jan De Bont's The Haunting and Steve Beck's 13 Ghosts.".

Working from Robb White's original story screenwriter Dick Beebe and director William Malone  previously responsible for such unassuming Bmovies as SCARED TO DEATH 1980 and CREATURE 1985  remain faithful to Castle's original whilst goosing the material with newfangled effects technology and levels of gore which Castle had been denied during his lifetime.

Sure the CG at the end prompts some definite eyerolling and I think that perhaps some neat looking retro stopmotion animation would have been better but if you can just kind of forgive that part the rest of it is very worthwhile.This is truly one of my all time favourite Horror films if you can get a hold of the German Bluray it is lovely!".

The creativity style and sheer talent for Horror films make this guy a joy to watch.This film is no exception BTW if you haven't seen 'PARASOMNIA' yet DO SO! The stunning visuals alone are worth it  his Artistic Consultant was a Polish artist that I REALLY like With over 500 reviews here there is no need for me to belabor the details but I freak'n LOVE this guy so much I just had to add my thoughts here. Sure the CG at the end prompts some definite eyerolling and I think that perhaps some neat looking retro stopmotion animation would have been better but if you can just kind of forgive that part the rest of it is very worthwhile.This is truly one of my all time favourite Horror films if you can get a hold of the German Bluray it is lovely!";

	schema:reviewBody "Usually my first impressions of a movie holds true upon repeat viewings. Unless the story is particularly deep or the plot difficult to follow subsequent viewings generally do not change my initial reaction to a movie to any great degree. So as I sat to watch The House on Haunted Hill I wasn't expecting much. The film is not without some major faults but overall I enjoyed my second experience. Scenes such as the operating room flashback or touches like the hall of embalmed bodies are the stuff of nightmares as far as I'm concerned.The house itself is another major bonus to the movie. The interior is presented lit and shot in a manner that creates almost immediate atmosphere. The seemingly endless corridors the surgicalmedical rooms with their devices of torture and the blood present almost everywhere added to my feeling that the house is the real star of the movie.But as I said the movie does have its faults. I'll just mention two First  paper thin characters. It's really difficult to care about many of the character in this movie because we know nothing about most of them. Other than Geoffrey Rush's character the others are there merely for the slaughter. They aren't real.Second  the ending. This appears to be everyone's major complaint and with good reason. All of the atmosphere and creepiness the movie had built is destroyed the moment the CGI darkness makes an appearance. It is so out of place with everything that had gone on before. It's to bad that the writers couldn't come up with a good ending  I would have much preferred an ending involving the doctor or former patients. The movie had been heading in that direction all along.When I initially saw this in the theater I would have rated it a 410. My opinion has now however changed. I may never consider it a masterpiece but there are some moments that are very effective and make it worth watching.".

Susan Sarandon has never been sexier or more appealing than as her freewheeling character Aretha. Raul Julia is a hoot as a lusty goatherd. The scenery in Greece is spectacular the New York settings cause me to squirm due to many shots of the World Trade Center. Fantastic score by Stomu Yamashta.

Cassavettes is surrounded by a first rate cast...his scenes with Rowlands crackle with intensity and his surprising chemistry with Sarandon is a stark contrast to his scenes with Rowlands. Ringwald shines in her film debut and there is a scenestealing performance by the late Raul Julia as Kalibanos Cassavettes' manservant on the island. Julia stops the show in one scene dancing with a flock of sheep accompanied by Liza Minnelli singing New York New York. This film is sad and tragic and funny and intense. Yes it's a little long and disjointed and it works a little too hard at being different there's even a curtain call at the end of the film but it never fails to hold the attention of those who like something a little different in their filmgoing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've often heard people express disappointment that Mazursky's Tempest has little to do with Shakespeare's original. In my opinion that is both true and false but most of all it's a bad starting point for offering critique. A work of art should never be criticised for what it isn't but for what it is. The movie Tempest is nothing like a faithful rendition of the play but to my mind it is faithful to Shakespeare's work in spirit. What Tempest is then is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time. No not experimental as in hand held camera and mumbled dialogue but experimental as in exploring the convolutions of a story without undue regard for box office earnings. Mazursky's Tempest is epic sad realistic joyous full of life but most of all it is imaginative.

	onyx:emotionText "I've often heard people express disappointment that Mazursky's Tempest has little to do with Shakespeare's original. In my opinion that is both true and false but most of all it's a bad starting point for offering critique. A work of art should never be criticised for what it isn't but for what it is. The movie Tempest is nothing like a faithful rendition of the play but to my mind it is faithful to Shakespeare's work in spirit. What Tempest is then is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time. No not experimental as in hand held camera and mumbled dialogue but experimental as in exploring the convolutions of a story without undue regard for box office earnings. Mazursky's Tempest is epic sad realistic joyous full of life but most of all it is imaginative. Cassavetes portrayal of PhilipProspero is in itself worth a 1010 rating and when you add Gena Rowlands Susan Sarandon a wonderfully deep Molly Ringwald Raul Julia the dialogue the music and the exquisitely suggestive little tableaux scattered throughout the picture... I rest my case. One of the best movies of the 80's. Don't miss it.";

This is a retake on the Shakespeare comedy but utterly removed from the stage. Without much text Mazursky and star Cassavettes make visual a midlife crisis of passion and purpose. Desperate to recenter himself Cassavettes retreats to a remote Greek islandwhere the locals and the island itself weave a little magic. With Raul Julia especially Susan Sarandon and Molly Ringwald this is an adult fantasy that is emotionally satisfying and visually gorgeous. And funny. It wasn't a big box office hit but whenever it does come to DVD it will sell.".

This especially comes to the forefront in a scene when upon spotting his estranged wife and her lover in a speedboat he conjures up a storm accompanied on the soundtrack by an appropriate selection from Stomu Yamashta's Go.  This is only one of the moments throughout the film where the line between reality and fantasy becomes nicely blurred and the viewer is left with the feeling that magic is more possible than one might believe.

	schema:reviewBody "The first time that I saw this film was at an outdoor cinema during the first summer I lived in Greece. I doubt that it is even possible for anyone anywhere to have a better summer than I did that year. I doubt that is would be possible to improve upon this wonderful movie although I was beginning to think that I may have overlyromanticized this film because everything else around me that summer was so perfect. This would have been 1984 and I hadn't seen the film again until last night.It's not like I didn't try to see the film again. When I got back to the States a few years later and the whole video craze was in full bloom I looked for a copy of Tempest in every mom and pop video store in the Washington D.C. area without success. Years after this came the internet and Amazon.com. I tried to buy the film but I could only find it on VHS format and I had already abandoned that technology. I could never find it on DVD anywhere until a few weeks ago. I bought it and had it mailed to my brother's home in Chicago and he relayed it to me here in Spain. Even Homer's Odyssey only took ten years.As I said I saw the movie at a little outdoor theater in a southern suburb of Athens called Glyfada which although attached to the sprawl of the capital has more of a beach town feel to it than big city. These little theaters were rather impromptu affairs that looked like someone had just set out a few chairs in their back yard and invited a few friends over. All that I remember is that they seemed to specialize in movies that were filmed in Greece. This was probably why I went to see Tempest.I have praised this movie for so many years that I was a bit worried that it wouldn't live up to the memory I had of it after seeing it so many years ago. I don't think anyone could blame me for overrating it considering the perfect setting for the first time I saw it.

	onyx:emotionText "The first time that I saw this film was at an outdoor cinema during the first summer I lived in Greece. I doubt that it is even possible for anyone anywhere to have a better summer than I did that year. I doubt that is would be possible to improve upon this wonderful movie although I was beginning to think that I may have overlyromanticized this film because everything else around me that summer was so perfect. This would have been 1984 and I hadn't seen the film again until last night.It's not like I didn't try to see the film again. When I got back to the States a few years later and the whole video craze was in full bloom I looked for a copy of Tempest in every mom and pop video store in the Washington D.C. area without success. Years after this came the internet and Amazon.com. I tried to buy the film but I could only find it on VHS format and I had already abandoned that technology. I could never find it on DVD anywhere until a few weeks ago. I bought it and had it mailed to my brother's home in Chicago and he relayed it to me here in Spain. Even Homer's Odyssey only took ten years.As I said I saw the movie at a little outdoor theater in a southern suburb of Athens called Glyfada which although attached to the sprawl of the capital has more of a beach town feel to it than big city. These little theaters were rather impromptu affairs that looked like someone had just set out a few chairs in their back yard and invited a few friends over. All that I remember is that they seemed to specialize in movies that were filmed in Greece. This was probably why I went to see Tempest.I have praised this movie for so many years that I was a bit worried that it wouldn't live up to the memory I had of it after seeing it so many years ago. I don't think anyone could blame me for overrating it considering the perfect setting for the first time I saw it.

	schema:headline " Likable cast in a quirky lowkey drama mostly set on a remote Greek island";
	schema:reviewBody "Released in 1982 and loosely based on Shakespeare's play Tempest stars John Cassavetes as Phillip a rich architect in a troubled marriage in New York City. When his wife Gena Rowlands decides to return to acting and things blowup he escapes to Greece with his daughter Molly Ringwald where they unite with a freespirited singer Susan Sarandon. Meanwhile Phillip's wife hooks up with his former boss Vittorio Gassman and they come to Greece looking for the daughter. Raul Julia plays an eccentric goatherd on the island while Sam Robards appears as a teen lothario. While I'm sure the Greece cinematography would be spectacular on the big screen it certainly is on the small screen Tempest isn't a film I'd likely want to see in the theater it flopped at the box office. Yet it works fine as a likably offbeat drama in the home.If you're a Sarandon fan you'll definitely want to check this out because she's in the prime of her life 35 yearsold during filming and is splendidly portrayed by the director Paul Mazursky from the getgo typically in alluring Mediterranean apparel. Likewise statuesque Lucianne Buchanan appears in the final act as blond Delores. This was Ringwald's debut. She was fine for the meaty role of the daughter but I was never enthralled by her which isn't to say I don't like her. Actually I'm not enamored by any of these women but they're all certainly agreeable one way or another.There are several highlights like Phillip coming home drunk to his wife's showbiz party where he awkwardly asks her producer director Paul Mazursky to dance. Needless to say it's the epitome of an uncomfortable social situation. The best part about Tempest however is that it's essentially an island flick although the cast aren't necessarily castaways and the island is a little bit North of the tropics. If you're a sucker for island flicks like me then Tempest is worth checking out. It's uniquely entertaining and somehow warmhearted. I realize Phillip Cassavetes is the Prospero character from The Bard's play and Prospero was a magician but the movie never explains Phillip's seeming ability to control the elements. We're just supposed to accept it. Why sure! In any case I presume he's projecting his mentalspiritual struggles on to the forces of nature. For those not in the know Cassavetes and Rowlands were husband  wife for almost 36 years which ended with the former's passing in 1989 at 59 yearsofage. He died of cirrhosis of the liver. The film runs 142 minutes was shot in New York City Atlantic City NJ and mostly Gytheio Greece which isn't an island but the southern tip of the remote Mani peninsula of the Peloponnesus of Greece.

Along with daughter Miranda Molly Ringwald Philip escapes to a remote Greek island with Miranda and his new mistress Aretha Susan Sarandon a nice Catholic girl who struggles with Philip's celibate lifestyle. Will a sudden storm bring all right in the end?Here's a thought on the career of Cassevetes How many other actors could make a film so confused into something so riveting? A darling of film critics for his earlier work often with his reallife wife Rowlands he presents a central character who really suffers for his art here but seems to enjoy himself and makes us enjoy him too. It's not Prospero but something rich and strange that makes for a terrific sea change all his own.It's all here he tells one of his faithful companions Aretha's dog Nino. Beauty magic inspiration and serenity. That it is. Tempest transfers 1611 London to 1982 Manhattan and finds some nice resonances in Philip's displaced life. Show me the magic he calls out to a stormtossed city skyscape and Mazursky's version augmented by Donald McAlpine's sterling cinematography of purple seascapes and naturally sunburnished Greek landscapes does just that.It's not a perfect movie by any means. In fact the big finale which is the only part of the movie that follows Shakespeare's storyline to any faithful extent is a mess. Rowland's character is hard to care much for in this film and after meeting Sarandon in all her braless glory it's hard to understand Philip's continuing concern for his wife let alone his leftfield desire to make an unhappy sacrifice in order to restore the natural order of things.But there's a lot to love about Tempest. In addition to Cassavetes there's Ringwald's film debut as his loyal but restless daughter here as in the play an object of desire for the primitive rustic Kalibanos Raul Julia. Ringwald here is very much the same teenaged muse of privileged adolescence that would inspire John Hughes but with an emotional depth those later Hughes films didn't delve into. Ringwald and Julia never got any Oscar attention but they both would win Golden Globes for their playful work here. He tries to woo her in her island isolation with his TV reruns of Gunsmoke in Greek tempted by her 15yearold body.I want to balonga you with my bonny johnny Kalibanos declares getting shoved aside but winning our sympathy anyway especially after performing New York New York with a chorus of goats. When Tempest hit the screens Julia was the toast of Broadway as the lead in Nine.It's Mazursky's show even if it feels at times that Cassavetes is running things with improvisational line readings and emotional breakdowns galore. Philip introduces himself to Aretha by telling her I'm right in the middle of a nervous breakdown. He plays his character as an amiable obsessive seeking to crystallize his happiness by building an theater in his otherwise uninhabited island.Adding to the enjoyment is Gassman's rich performance as the other man who is as completely amiable as Julia while telling a youthobsessed Philip Boys don't have half as much fun as we have. They're nervous...and they make love in the back of an old sports car. Despite being overlong and pretentious in spots like so many art films Tempest is entertaining in its excesses and a trip very much like Shakespeare intended even if his dreams didn't involve smoking pot backstage at a GoGos concert.".

	schema:reviewBody "The last time that I saw this was years ago and I thought that I was too young to understand the themes of this movie.  I just recently seen this movie again and now I realize that I wasn't naive the movie was just bad.Here's a breakdown of the story.  John Cassavetes plays Phillup Dimitrius an emotionally and spiritually burnedout casino designer for a rich Greek industrialist.  Phillup feels empty inside because he marriage is crumbling from his wifes' longing for her old acting carrier he's lost touch with his teenage daughter and can't stand his bosses healthailing temper and brownnosing cronies.  To top things off his two unhappy worlds come together in the worst way when he finds out that his wife Gena Rowlands cheating with his boss.Phillup decides to make a clean break from every and I mean everything by going off to the remote islands of Greece.  He then goes crazy in a different way.  Nothing could be better for Phil.  He's indulgently happy with his daughter and new Gypsylike new girlfriend Susan Sarandon. Things are fine for him until his wife along with Phil's old boss come in search of Phil to bring Phils' daughter Miranda played by brat packer Molly Ringwald home to New York.I could not get over how boring this film is.  The strange thing is this. This film was made twenty years ago.  It had such potential for being a groundbreaking film.  It told it's story out of continuity.  This narrative aspect was what helped films like Pulp Fiction Out of Sight and Memento become monster hits.  The film also dealt with the theme of a successful businessman feeling empty inside a theme used in films like Fight Club American Beauty and Office Space.  The film also had the early performances of Molly Ringwald and Susan Sarandon.  The two of them get into a charming rendition of Why do Fools Fall in Love.None of these things can save this movie because they are all used in the most clumsy and boring way.  The conversations in this film is just constant banter of Phil bickering with all of his associations.  It takes far too long to get past the exposition to even hold ones interest.  When the gang get to Greece the story goes from boring to drownmyselfinthelake boring. Phil gets far too selfindulgent to even make sence.The climax of this film the headlining storm comes and goes.  It practacly contributes nothing to the plot.  There's even a usless scene where Phil trys to come off as if he's come to some kind of spiritual wisdom by killing a goat and just comes off as being more arrogant and mentally disturbed.The film tries to to add a subplot of Miranda forming a romance with the son of Phils' boss played by Sam Robards.  Sadly his presence is a electrifying as watching paint dry.  Their relationship is even more predictable and tediously useless.The only thing that keeps me from screaming is complete anguish and boredom is the winning performance of the lategreat Raul Julia.  Julia plays the local hermit Kalibanos.  His character adds the only amount of scale to the story.  He foils Cassavete wonderfully.  He's crazy but in the good way. He's eccentric.  He gives the film little life by  playing the claranette singing to his goats and making advances to Miranda with his trinatron. This film would have been better if it got rid of half of the exposition all of the useless banter between Phil and his wife and put more focus on Phil's relationship with Kalibanos.  Sadly the film overlooks this more entertaining plotpoint.To sum up unless your going to use your DVD to jump to the moments with Raul Julia don't bother wasting your time with this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are some nice elements here. Molly Ringwald at 14 her first film Susan Sarandon and Gena Rowlands all charm. The Greek scenery is nice but not particularly well exploited. Raul Julia and Sarandon steal every scene they are in master actors.But the writing is dreary wandering all over the place. I'm very patient with meditative movies but this just meanders. The Tempest connection is so very slight.

	schema:reviewBody "Tempest is based on the classic Shakespearean work of the same name but bears little resemblance to its source material.It masquerades as being as cerebral as its namesake but instead is a jumbled convoluted and hackneyed exercise in tedium. The original probed the premise that people have an evil side which would be destructive if unchecked. Here you just get an uninteresting mid life crisis yawn goof ball who is having everything go wrong in his personal and professional life. He becomes endowed with a supernatural power that he uses to try to control his environment in other words to get his own way.Every few minutes after something else in his pathetic life goes wrong he finds a secluded place and starts babbling Show me the magic! while waving his hands around and making a serious concentration expression. From the way these scenes are shot it looks like he's trying to turn bugs into other kinds of bugs. Turning a spider into a cockroach maybe but by this time you really don't care.The story has him bolt from his life with his daughter to a Greek island somewhere then have a awkward relationship with some girl he meets one of the dullest romances ever committed to film. The story just bogs down and moves at a slower and slower pace. You are never given any reason to like or dislike anyone.I'll give this a 2 because of the beautiful Greek location shots and the semioptimistic conclusion although it isn't clear if the tempest power brought this ending about or not. The spirit of Shakespeare's work has been captured much better in other movies one notable example is Forbidden Planet which gave credence to how the power gets out of control.As for this Tempest its only magic is to cure insomnia.".

I remember the pay for service cable channels played this thing almost to death much like poltergeist when it first came out and many other popular films. I felt back then it wasn't worth the fuss and constant airtime I know cable isn't really on air given it but I was very young and adult situation drama wouldn't have and shouldn't have worked. However recent viewing of the film has enlightened me on the film. I think that Susan Surandon and Molly Ringwald were likely studying the script together and I would be a bit surprised if Surandon had coached Ringwald during this project. Ringwald's other projects while good do not have her exhibiting the potential depth as this role. Surandon nailed hers as Raul Julia did also. Cassavettes and wife delivered acceptable performances but I will admit at times first class acting turns to mediocre. A steady ebb and flow to the acting does take place during many scenes but overall I can see why the story might call for the dynamic to become more subtle.All in all I don't find this film to be the take me out and drown me kind of boredom fest as Skywalker02 would have you believe. I think that perhaps with the right psychological training and a bit more hardship in one's domestic life strategically placed coupled with some film courses perhaps this film would appear different. I would say if you are feeling a bit melancholy and yearn for a simpler life and you have had your share of marital discord amongst dysfunctional family units then perhaps this film might provide more insight and entertainment than you might think. I do feel it is a classic and find it much more entertaining than mainstream films that are supposed to share many of the same elements such as Terms of Endearment which as far as I am concerned could be stripped of a few extraordinary performances by Jack Nicholson then ceremoniously burned until nothing is left. How could a film like that get more attention than this one. Talk about boredom.Best thing don't take my word or anyone else's see the film and support our industry.".

He is married to Antonia Gena Rowlands and the marriage is in trouble. Philip works for industrialist Alonzo Vittorio Gassman . He abruptly quits his job and goes with his daughter Miranda Molly Ringwald to Greece where he meets young Aretha Tomalin Susan Sarandon. They go to a remote island where they are greeted by goatherd Kalibanos Raul Julia who lives in a cave and set up shop.Philip is supposed to have Miranda only for the summer. When the summer vacation period ends Antonia who has been taken unto Alonzo wants Miranda back. So they set out on a luxury cruise to find Philip and Miranda. That's basically it.The movie is a zig zag sort of film moving back and forth between the present and the time where Philip leaves when he finds Aretha and a visit with his father Paul Stewart. The cast breaks into song at various times making little sense especially at the end party. I never was a fan of Cassavetes method acting style and this film is no exception. He's moody and a little eccentric throughout. Poor Raul Julia is a buffoon here as the Greek goatherd. Susan Sarandon is gorgeous in the prime of her youth. Sam Robards plays Ringwald's love interest as the son of Alonzo. Alonzo's entourage Trinc the comedian Jackie Gayle Harry Jerry Hardin and Dr. Sebastian Anthony Holland are along strictly as comic relief. Director Paul Mazursky and his wife Betsy play the Bloomfields at a party in Philip and Antonia's apartment.The ending is pure Hollywood with everyone living happily ever after. The movie is overlong at 140 minutes and I found myself praying for it to end.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some might say that Mario Lanza was overweight and not in his best voice for this Movie but that would be judging him by those factors alone. This in my opinion ironically is Lanza's best Movie ever! Serenade is a very dramatic Movie with great performances from the likes of Joan Fontaine and in particular Sarita Montiel who really makes this Picture. Add this to the beautiful colourful backdrops and a haunting and dramatic score in the use of 'Serenade' and what you have is a cocktail for a fabulous Movie! For a two hour Film this could have been 'overlong' but in fact the two hours fly by as the whole is so absorbing.This lush Masterpiece from 1956 is so underrated as to never have been released on either Video or DVD in the United Kingdom  and only on Video for a limited period in the USA. If you want to own this Movie you're going to have to be patient and hunt madly but it will be well worth the time spent! And for those who've already seen it they will want to own it also and so you'll have some pretty stiff competition in obtaining one of those scarce copies! If you haven't seen it then book yourself a night in when it is next shown on TV for a great piece of entertainment and have the chocolates and wine at the ready for a good quality night's viewing! This is a superb production  oh and don't forget the tissues!Simply magic!".

	schema:reviewBody "Serenade is far and away Lanza's most interesting movie. True The Great Caruso is a more accessible film and the best introduction to Lanza but Serenade packs a far greater punch. This is melodrama to the nth degree and fittingly it contains some of the finest dramatic singing ever recorded.Let's get the quibbles out of the way first. Injudicious editing has made some of the scenes appear silly and illogical. The speed with which Lanza becomes obsessed with Joan Fontaine seems absurd and the ending could have been so much better. Would that the scenarists had had the courage to follow more closely the James Cain novel on which this movie is based but then again this was Hollywood 1955. Had the movie been made without the censorship constraints of say a mere ten years later it could have been a masterpiece. All I can say is read the novel and you'll see what I mean!I would also criticize Anthony Mann's direction at times. Retakes of some of Lanza's hammier moments should definitely have been made and the film lacks at times the full dramatic treatment that its subject deserves. Retakes of Lanza's Nessun Dorma and Di Quella Pira should also have been made. In both arias he sounds uncharacteristically strained and in each case a second take would have sorted out the problem.Quibbles aside Lanza's acting is often outstanding the Ave Maria scene for instance is a revelation. Vincent Price Lanza's acidtongued and hilarious manager in the movie later remarked offscreen how impressed he was with the tenor's dedicated approach to his acting. Sarita Montiel is also outstanding in her role as a fiery Mexican bullfighter's daughter providing Lanza with his bestever leading lady.But what makes this film a vocal masterpiece is Lanza's singing. La Danza Torna a Surriento Amor Ti Vieta O Paradiso the Otello Monologue Dio! Mi potevi scagliar... and the heartrending Lamento Di Federico are all astonishing feats of singing. By 1955 Lanza's voice had darkened into a lirico spinto tenor that often borders on the dramatic. It is rare indeed to hear a tenor with such baritonal fullness AND a ringing tenorial top. Eat your heart out Placido Domingo! Lanza  For my money the Otello Monologue is the pinnacle of Lanza's operatic legacy and the finest recording of this aria. The scene in which it appears is also brilliantly acted by Lanza. As the critic John Cargher would later remark Lanza's rendition of the Otello Monologue alone would assure him of immortality.All criticism aside Serenade remains a source of immense pleasure to me and it is richly deserving of far wider appreciation.".

So in the opening sequence when Joan Fontaine with her protege Vince Edwards playing a hotheaded boxer in a long low luxurious Lincoln convertible top down of course stop by the side of a vineyard where Mario Lanza is laboring quite without any sign of perspiration by the way...must have been an unseasonably cool day despite the blazing sunshine! to ask directions I was hooked.  The fireengine red Premiere convertible is as lovingly photographed as the stars and it wasn't until Sarita Montiel playing Mario's true love Juana makes her entrance that I ceased wishing that resplendent automobile would again appear to do justice to the use of Technicolor oops! I mean Warnercolor in this soapwithmusic.Sarita though her list of Spanish language films is quite awesome never enjoyed much of a career in Hollywood films. We weren't nearly as accepting of nonAnglo leading ladies back then.  She is just gorgeous in this one and her playing as the fiery and passionate what else?!? Juana helped Mario convince us that he was a man who could be snatched from the diabolical and devastating ensnarements of Joan Fontaine's spoiled heiress Kendall Hale.  The introduction of her character when Mario flees in disgrace to Mexico permits a scenic and worththepriceofadmission tour of Mexican locales.The music is fairly well presented in this one.  Not being an opera connoisseur I am not qualified to comment knowledgeably on Mr. Lanza's renditions of operatic excerpts but I have always found his tenor voice to be among the most listenable So many of them just bleat! and his constant reprising of the title song throughout this movie did not grow tiresome at least to these ears.A side note  Mario's father quite a dear old gentleman who had remarried lived down the street in the Huntington Palisades section of Pacific Palisades in southern California where my family owned a home.  I frequently saw Mario's Cadillac parked in his father's driveway but alas! never caught a glimpse of the goldenvoiced Mario himself who was you may be sure his father's pride and joy.".

	schema:reviewBody "At this time it is very easy to pan this outrageously inept rendition of the James M. Cain groundbreaking novel. People forget that back in 1955 it would have been impossible to film Serenade as written by the author. You can also say that Anthony Mann was not the ideal director for this kind of musical melodrama since he was more at home in the film noir and western genres. In spite of all that Serenade is not a bad movie and can be enjoyed by all but most specially by opera lovers. Mario Lanza is mesmerizing singing some of the world's most beloved music. In my opinion he was never more effective as a singer than on this Warner Bros Technicolor production. As an actor Mr. Lanza has some good and bad moments playing Damon the humble California vineyard worker who achieves fame and fortune only to be destroyed by his obsessive passion for beautiful socialite Kendall Hale Joan Fontaine who enjoys making stars out of her lovers and then dropping them for the next hopeful in line. When he hits rock bottom in Mexico he is rescued and rehabilitated by a wealthy bullfighter's daughter the earthy and also beautiful Juana Montes Sarita Montiel. When Damon goes back to the U.S. with Juana to relaunch his career Miss Hale shows up again with every intention to manipulate the singer once more. Will she succeed? All that mayhem is worthy just to listen to Lanza's glorious voice sing with outstanding gusto Torna a Sorrento a most moving Ave Maria Schubert or Puccini's Nessum Dorma from Turandot. As both a singer and an actor Lanza is particularly effective in his rendition of Verdi's Dio Ti Giocondi from Othello doubtless one of the artist's best moments in film. I find the supporting cast brilliant with special mentions going to Vincent Price as the sarcastic witty opera manager and the gorgeous Sarita as the temperamental Juana.".

In spite of all that Serenade is not a bad movie and can be enjoyed by all but most specially by opera lovers. Mario Lanza is mesmerizing singing some of the world's most beloved music. In my opinion he was never more effective as a singer than on this Warner Bros Technicolor production. As an actor Mr. Lanza has some good and bad moments playing Damon the humble California vineyard worker who achieves fame and fortune only to be destroyed by his obsessive passion for beautiful socialite Kendall Hale Joan Fontaine who enjoys making stars out of her lovers and then dropping them for the next hopeful in line. When he hits rock bottom in Mexico he is rescued and rehabilitated by a wealthy bullfighter's daughter the earthy and also beautiful Juana Montes Sarita Montiel. When Damon goes back to the U.S. with Juana to relaunch his career Miss Hale shows up again with every intention to manipulate the singer once more. Will she succeed? All that mayhem is worthy just to listen to Lanza's glorious voice sing with outstanding gusto Torna a Sorrento a most moving Ave Maria Schubert or Puccini's Nessum Dorma from Turandot. As both a singer and an actor Lanza is particularly effective in his rendition of Verdi's Dio Ti Giocondi from Othello doubtless one of the artist's best moments in film. I find the supporting cast brilliant with special mentions going to Vincent Price as the sarcastic witty opera manager and the gorgeous Sarita as the temperamental Juana.";

	schema:headline " Cain Not Able to do anything for Mario";
	schema:reviewBody "For his one and only film away from an MGM release Mario Lanza went to Warner Brothers in 1956 to star in a film adaption of James M. Cain's novel Serenade. It's the story of an opera singer discovered and then abandoned by society girl Joan Fontaine and then redeemed by the love of a good woman played by Mexican film star Sarita Montiel.James M. Cain was an author who had given the screen a few classic films from his work like Double Indemnity Mildred Pierce and The Postman Always Rings Twice. But Cain was unable to give the screen anything more than a turgid melodrama with Serenade. It was not in the class as a novel or a film as those other three works.However one watches a Mario Lanza film to hear him sing and he's in good voice with the usual mixture of classical opera Italian folk songs and a pair of new songs by Nicholas Brodzsky and Sammy Cahn who had already given him Be My Love and Because You're Mine. Mario sings the title song and My Destiny from Brodzsky and Cahn and they're good but not in the league with those two other classics identified with him. My favorite out of the score is La Danza which is sung toward the beginning of the film. Lanza did an outstanding record of this as did his idol Enrico Caruso in the early days of commercial recording.The Code was still firmly in place or Vincent Price's character as the opera impresario would be more obviously gay. As it is Price gets the best lines in the film and makes the most of them.If watching Serenade I'd fast forward to Mario's songs and listen to them. They're what gives Serenade any lasting popularity.".

There's a TV channel in Russia called Culture and TV programs and films goes there WITHOUT ANY ADDS! Can you imagine it? I can! So yesterday I've made a very good tape record of Serenade on VHS NOT SVHS tape recorder and I'd like to say a few words on this film. When I watched it for the first time now it was for the third time it hasn't made anything to me that is I thought the film is good and that's all. But now I think that it is not all. I can tell you that yesterday I hardly could help... crying! Yes that's it! Because there was Mario Lanza and there certainly was Sara Montiel the most beautiful woman in the world. If it happened that you haven't seen this film yet please watch it! What for? I beg you pardon if you don't like Mario's singing! just watch it to enjoy Sara her voice and her eyes. Remember NOT TO MISS the scene in the final in which Sara plays just... so fine that you cannot believe your eyes and your ears. But don't worry about her  she would be all right! There is also a lot of highclass music not only fascinating Othello's aria from Verdi's opera worths mentioning!. In all aspects this is indeed one of the best film of all movies of all times and peoples. If I could give it 1000  I would but I can give 10 maximum... Just so fine that you cannot believe yourself! I'm deeply sorry for my bad English.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was the fourth of just 7 starring vehicles for turbulent Italian tenor Mario Lanza although not his best or most popular that remains 1951's THE GREAT CARUSO Anthony Mann was easily the best director he ever had. It was actually Lanza's first film in 4 years a period marked by the debacle of THE STUDENT PRINCE 1954 where director Curtis Bernhardt decided he had had enough of the star's tantrums had him summarily fired and replaced by Edmund Purdom who mimed to Lanza's own singing! Anyway the screenplay here is so predictable that it seems written on autopilot and one is hardpressed to believe that it was based on a novel penned by hardboiled noir writer James M. Cain it comes as no surprise then to learn that the film version was heavily bowdlerized! Incidentally Cain was also behind similar musical soap opera stuff like WHEN TOMORROW COMES 1939 and its remake INTERLUDE 1957 that had equally boasted the services of notable directors John M. Stahl and Douglas Sirk respectively for their transition to the screen! On a personal note it is unfortunate that while respected Maltese character actor Joseph Calleia got to work with two of Hollywood's most talented filmmakers of that time within the same year it was only on their least interesting movies this and Nicholas Ray's HOT BLOOD! what is even worse is that another Maltese who goes by the name of Joseph Calleia is currently enjoying worldwide fame as a tenor himself  thus endangering his earlier namesake who died back in 1975's own fledgling reputation on his home ground! The supporting cast of SERENADE is quite good actually Joan Fontaine she has the right looks for the role of the bitchy society dame who entraps Lanza in her tangled web but there is next to no chemistry between them! Sarita Montiel Mann's wife at the time she has the role of Lanza's beautiful Mexican redeemer Vincent Price a breath of fresh air as the witty artless impresario Silvio Minciotti as Lanza's first restaurateur employer Vince Edwards as Fontaine's temperamental prizefighting pet and Edward Platt as the director of Lanza's illfated stage debut performance of Othello  which he hysterically abandons in midaria simply because Fontaine has not turned up to see him!. Similarly histrionic moments occur during a thunderstorm in the Mexican plains almost evoking John Ford's THE QUIET MAN 1952! and when a jealous Montiel incidentally she has her own jilted lover to contend with! loses it by bullfighting a mocking Fontaine at a society party that precipitates an unbelievably contrived climactic traffic accident with an inevitable happy outcome just as Lanza is about to go live on the airwaves! To counter such melodramatic if appropriately operatic outbursts perhaps the film's best sequence is the simple and moving one in which Lanza and Montiel enter a Mexican church to pray and it is here that he regains his selfconfidence having spent some time on the skids and then returned to his roots as a fieldworker! by singing Schubert's Ave Maria.Apart from the aforementioned Othello the film also shows Lanza performing a famous aria from Giuseppe Verdi's Il Trovatore incidentally I have just acquired Renato Castellani's 10hour biopic of the famed Italian composer shot in 1982 for Italian TV with Ronald Pickup in the lead! as well as 2 new songs in English one of them 'composed' and played on the piano by Vincent Price and the title tune which is reprised for the finale. Having mentioned the English numbers just now it is odd given his proud heritage that when Lanza is about to leave home early on in search of success managed by his cousin Harry Bellaver he treats his paisani to a pop tune  and in a foreign tongue to boot! By the way this viewing came via a TCM U.K. broadcast of the Warner Bros. production albeit screened fullframe.".

	schema:headline " Lanza stars in film adaptation of James Cain novel";
	schema:reviewBody "Mario Lanza at the age of 34 was a complete mess  bloated from drinking overweight and making a film comeback of sorts. Though his voice had been heard in The Student Prince he hadn't appeared in a film in four years. Serenade based on the novel by James Cain minus the gay love affair was the vehicle to return him to the screen. Cain was a great lover of opera and incorporated it into this novel and also into the novel Mildred Pierce.Lanza plays Damon a vineyard worker with a golden voice who is discovered by a socialite Kendall Hale Joan Fontaine who sets him up with a major voice teacher. With the help of Kendall and those around her Damon is given a star buildup. The only problem is Kendall is someone who encourages artists and then dumps them. Damon is in love with her and on the night of his debut we assume at the Met singing Otello a good choice for the story but he never would have sung it until he was in his fifties at a minimum if at all she doesn't show up. He is so obsessed with her that right before he strangles Desdemona he walks off stage removes his costume and makeup and goes to Kendall's place. What an idiot. His career in tatters he goes to Mexico City and gets a job as Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni. But he's having a nervous breakdown. No wonder  the role is completely wrong for him. Damon winds up ill and is brought back to health by a family which includes Juana Sarita Monteil. With her help Damon gradually feels strong enough to try singing again. But can he? Lanza had a beautiful natural voice. Technique wasn't his strong suit he scooped a lot and tended to oversing  but he brought opera to the common man. Before him opera singers in films had been divas and divos  Jeanette MacDonald Grace Moore et al.  but Lanza always played the truck driver with the beautiful voice. There were comments here on this site that his voice had darkened  frankly at 34 that shouldn't have happened yet. As a person ages we're talking 40s and 50s here the vocal cords thicken and often the middle voice warms up and becomes stronger and some of the top goes. Joan Fontaine at nearly 40 was a stunning woman with a beautiful slim figure. At this point in her career she was playing the society woman often in roles too young for her as in Beyond a Reasonable Doubt. But the sweet naive girl of Rebecca had turned into the rich woman with an educated speaking voice and cool looks. Unlike other actresses of her age Fontaine managed to eek out more years in good films than some of her counterparts because of this change in image. She does a great job as the cold Kendall. As Juana Sarita Monteil is beautiful and her passion and intensity are a great contrast to Fontaine. The gowns in the film were gorgeous for both women.Mario Lanza was a tragic figure possessed of a beautiful voice and a natural tendency toward stockiness. Due to the pressure on him to lose weight his crash dieting and drinking eventually affected his heart. In fact there was nothing wrong with his appearance or his very likable relaxed screen presence. But as with Judy Garland Louis B couldn't leave it alone. Lanza was a problematic individual difficult to work with and someone who sexually harassed his female costars. He was his own worst enemy but what a legacy.".

There were comments here on this site that his voice had darkened  frankly at 34 that shouldn't have happened yet. As a person ages we're talking 40s and 50s here the vocal cords thicken and often the middle voice warms up and becomes stronger and some of the top goes. Joan Fontaine at nearly 40 was a stunning woman with a beautiful slim figure. At this point in her career she was playing the society woman often in roles too young for her as in Beyond a Reasonable Doubt. But the sweet naive girl of Rebecca had turned into the rich woman with an educated speaking voice and cool looks. Unlike other actresses of her age Fontaine managed to eek out more years in good films than some of her counterparts because of this change in image. She does a great job as the cold Kendall. As Juana Sarita Monteil is beautiful and her passion and intensity are a great contrast to Fontaine. The gowns in the film were gorgeous for both women.Mario Lanza was a tragic figure possessed of a beautiful voice and a natural tendency toward stockiness. Due to the pressure on him to lose weight his crash dieting and drinking eventually affected his heart. In fact there was nothing wrong with his appearance or his very likable relaxed screen presence. But as with Judy Garland Louis B couldn't leave it alone. Lanza was a problematic individual difficult to work with and someone who sexually harassed his female costars. He was his own worst enemy but what a legacy.";

	schema:reviewBody "Continuing with corrections admonishments on spurious opinions etc. peters1591  ....he had only 18 minutes of voice. He could not sustain it in a full scale opera is absolute nonsense. He had already sung in complete opera performances THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR and MADAMA BUTTERFLY done some 80 crosscountry concerts with the Bel Canto Trio with George London and Frances Yeend and for the last several years of his life gave concerts that would have included a minimum of about 60 minutes of singing more than in most tenor roles in the standard opera repertory one of them the Royal Albert Hall concert that was issued by RCA Victor while he was still alive. Even worse is this reviewer's allegation that Lanza was killed by Mafia types. This has long been discredited and had no basis in even suspicion to begin with just someone making up a new 'hook' with which to sell a book. Lanza was extremely sick with half a dozen ailment the worst of which was a bad heart. Given the way he lived you could almost justify a claim that he unknowingly committed suicide. But he was NOT murdered by the Mafia or anyone else!Neil Doyle  Schubert's Ave Maria is hardly rendered in ringing tones. In fact just the opposite.TheLittleSongbird  Actually the OTELLO Monologue is not at all very heavy stuff for Lanza to take on. The first half is mostly done in halfvoice on the same note the aria never rises beyond Bflat and it is actually quite easy to sing except for the very end. The whole role lies low which is why so many famous Otellos  Zenatello Zanelli Melchior Schmedes Guichandut Vinay to name a few  had successful professional careers as baritones before switching up to tenor to be able to sing the relatively lowlying Otello andor the Wagner tenor repertoire most of which lies similarly low indeed every second Wagnerian tenor in history seems to have had a second career in OTELLO. The hard part of it is getting the proper emotion into those semiparlando passages and Lanza manages to do this pretty well without being in any way outstanding when compared to the great Otellos. It is not to denigrate him when I say I could easily name 30 or 40 equal or superior versions while still liking his. But to hear a Martinelli Met broadcast of this piece or Melchior's Germanlanguage performance or Zenatello's Fonotipia recording and comparing any one of them to Lanza's would be as unfair as would be comparing Olivier's King Lear to one by John Wayne.artzau  His music was marginal his phrasing and articulation shoddy is pure nonsense  possibly received opinion from snobs. There was nothing marginal about his musicality which is I assume what was meant and his phrasing and articulation were excellent in Italian French and Spanish and damned near miraculous in English. Indeed his clarity of diction in the English language far surpasses that of any other classicaltrained singer I know of even John McCormack's who was a paragon of virtue in this respect but managed to sing all languages with a brogue!. His only equal in this respect is Eileen Farrell but she had to dispense with her legitimate soprano voice and assume a completely chestbased popular singing style that seems as much modeled on Judy Garland's as on any other pop singer who comes to mind. But when Farrell sings English in classical song or in the few opera excerpts she ever did in English she is not at all clear in her enunciation. Some other classically trained singers come close  like Robert Merrill  but there is always something about their sound even in popular music that sounds 'classical'. When Lanza sings Kern or Rodgers or Berlin or Herbert we hear a full operatic tenor voice that makes the lyrics totally clear in plain oldfashioned nonrolled 'r' and broad 'a' pronunciation so that it still sounds like a popular or Broadway song and not a piece being done by some opera singer who is slumming think Richard Crooks. Kathy Jurado never existed. If you mean Katy Jurado she did exist but was not in this film. I won't argue opinions except to say that your comment about how bad he was as an opera singer was not and is not shared by the many opera singers he sang with  George London Frances Yeend Lucine Amara Dorothy Kirsten and especially Licia Albanese and Elaine Malbin. I see Ms. Malbin every three months at the quarterly Mario Lanza Luncheon held at Patsy's Italian Restaurant Sinatra's favorite goto place in New York City she still raves about him as did both Lucine Amara and Licia Albanese when they used to attend the luncheons.Well that's it and I hope I haven't hurt anyone's feelings in expressing my own. But the subject of Opera is a vast one and often you really do have to submerge your life into it to really understand that vastness. One can call Lanza this that and the next thing but what does it matter if one's standards of comparison are incomplete? Leo Slezak father of Walter was the greatest MiddleEuropean tenor of the first 30 years of the last century holding a place there fully equal to that held by Caruso in this country. Caruso was not all that popular in Italy and rarely sang there after coming to the Met. Melchior is universally regarded as the greatest Wagnerian tenor of all time but if your exposure to him is only through MGM films you haven't even started to understand his greatness. You may have heard Caruso and Melchior but probably not Slezak so what's the point of pontificating on who was the greatest tenor of the century until you have. And then there are about two or three hundred other tenors I might mention. The point is don't worry about it and just go about enjoying Lanza for what he was  to my mind possessor of the most beautiful lyric tenor voice America has ever produced.As for the film well if you seen the dozen or more films made by both Beniamino Gigli and Richard Tauber and the halfdozen or so made by Jan Kiepura and Joseph Schmidt it will enable you to more easily appreciate what MGM gave us from the EddyMacDonald era through Grayson to Lanza and ending with INTERRUPTED MELODY and what Warners at least tried to give us in their Grace Moore biopic SO THIS IS LOVE and with SERENADE maybe America's last gasp at including Opera in America's standard screen culture.".

Of which Serenade even with its flaws replaces The Great Caruso as the best of themnot counting The Student Prince which only had Lanza's voice featuring as good as that film is. Something to bear in mind is that Serenade is a film that should be judged on its own merits as a film other than the title and some characters names it does deviate quite substantially from the superband superior book it's based on. As an adaptation it's pretty much a bowdlerisation being tonally significantly toned down due to censorship as a film on its own merits while not perfect it's very good.Serenade's weakest aspect is the script to sum it up in one word it's patchy with much of it feeling very bland with the exception of Winthrop's very witty dialogue and the writing being rather soapoperaish in the frothy and melodramatic sense. The romance between Damon and Kendall's characters also seemed rather hastily written and rushed in development and the chemistry between the two of them felt cold. Also the ending didn't do much for me it just felt forced and didn't quite seem to gel with the rest of the story.The production values are absolutely topnotch though the costumes and sets being the very meaning of lavish and the photography is rich and vibrant in colour as well as looking so professionally shot the Ave Maria and Otello Monologue scenes are superbly filmed. It is very difficult to put into words how good the music is without resorting to superlatives the music score is energetic sumptuous and whimsical while Serenade while no Be My Love or Because You're Mine is a worthy main song. There are many operaticclassical music favourites here that will delight many an opera fan with Otello's Monologue Ave Maria and Lamento di Federico coming off particularly strongly.Serenade has one of the betterexecuted stories perhaps even the best of any of Lanza's films. Despite being longer than the average Lanza film at two hours it didn't feel that long to me and is more eventful Lanza's MGM efforts story wise were as thin as a wafer and less predictable than his earlier films and even is more emotionally investing the book is darker but the film isn't any less poignant. Mann's directs with a sure hand and the characters engage at least while not having an awful lot of dimension to them. The performances are very good with the best acting performance coming from Vincent Price giving one of my favourite supporting performances by far in a Lanza film who is menacingly urbane and hilariously acidtongued.Lanza's performance contains the best overall acting he ever did he overdoes it occasionally sure and Nessun Dorma sounds uncharacteristically strained but his achingly sincere acting in Ave Maria and poignancy in Lamento di Federico more than makes up. He is at his best in the Otello Monologue this is different and very heavy stuff for Lanza to take on but he brings riveting intensity and heartwrenching emotion that it was difficult to not be moved by him. Lanza is also in golden voice it's darker and heavier than his earlier films but has lost none of its beauty or what made the voice distinctive musicality and phrasing are fine too. Joan Fontaine while not at her absolute best is both alluring and coolly vindictive and Sarita Montiel is sensual and fiery with her performance certainly not being devoid of heart like Lanza her actingespecially in her very telling reaction to hearing him singing in the Ave Maria scene is magical.All in all well worth watching and a must for Mario Lanza fans. Fans of the book beware but opera and Lanza fans will be in heaven judging the film on its own it has replaced The Great Caruso as my choice for his best film. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Serenade is the seventh and final Mario Lanza film I have reprised recently and my least favourite. This is not what I had expected as many critics say it has greater dramatic stature and complexity that his other more lightweight films. Serenade is a typical drama of its time rather cheesy and unconvincing really as it lacks realism. It does allow Lanza to emote freely which he does most convincingly in his Otello costume after having given utterance to some splendidly dramatic singing. The singing which is after all the raison d'etre of the film is plentiful and enjoyable. I thought Joan Fontaine was fine as the ultrasmooth and rather serpentlike Kendall. I did not like Sarita Montiel she projected a rather sulky and arrogant quality and I was afraid Mario might impale himself on her superpointy bazooms. But my chief discomfort was Lanza's appearance. Much is made of his weight fluctuation during this and some other movies but it's not so much the bulk of his body that is the concern as his really fat puffy cheeks widening his face and squeezing his eyes. They do not go well with his chiselled nose lips and chin. In some sections of footage he looks better than others but altogether it is quite distressing. In his final two films he does not look so unhealthy ironic when you consider that his premature death was even closer. The film has glamorous and colourful settings to enjoy so together with the singing and some capable supporting actors complementing the principals it seems a bit mean to rate it only a six but that's my feeling overall.".

	onyx:emotionText "Serenade is the seventh and final Mario Lanza film I have reprised recently and my least favourite. This is not what I had expected as many critics say it has greater dramatic stature and complexity that his other more lightweight films. Serenade is a typical drama of its time rather cheesy and unconvincing really as it lacks realism. It does allow Lanza to emote freely which he does most convincingly in his Otello costume after having given utterance to some splendidly dramatic singing.

Like Negulesco he was one of those directors who knew how to get great effects on a small budget but give him a big budget and it becomes money on the screen to me. Sometimes it worked I'm sure the battle in SPARTACUS in which the Romans attack in terrifying unison only for the rebel slaves to roll burning logs through their disintegrating ranks was his and sometimes it didn't the Dead Guy a Horse in EL CID.

Raquel Welch is his mistress Queenie a former showgirl who puts up with Grimm's temper and beatings longer than she should. The film takes place in a frantic 24hour period wherein just about every disaster and humiliation possible befalls Grimm leading up to the tragicdramatic finale.  The titular party is more tacky than wild but it looks like a lot of fun populated as it is by a host of curious Hollywood characters. Coco is a standout in a role that should have received more attention. The same holds for Welch who works like a Trojan and kinda dances like one in her numerous musical numbers and while never quite pulling off the dialog Ya big lug! is rather endearing in her efforts. Special applause for Tiffany Bolling as Welch's best friend. She is funny and real and would have made a wonderfully vulnerable Queenie.Even when being batted around by Coco Welch looks like she could punch Coco into the sound era. Though essentially a tragedy The Wild Party is too flawed to be moving but is a really enjoyable and visually rich film. The musical score featuring The Herbert Hoover Drag is a gem!".

	schema:reviewBody "Loosely based on the 1920's film star Fatty Arbuckle scandal in which he was tried but acquitted of raping a young girl during a Hollywood party resulting in the demise of his career this is adapted from a narrative poem that has some similarities to Arbuckle but notable differences as well. Dukes plays a writer who narrates the story from his hospital bed. He recounts the difficulty that his associate silent film comedian Coco has had in holding onto a career in the cinema business. Coco hasn't had a film released in five years and is throwing a huge bash in order to show his latest opus to various studio heads in the hopes that they will distribute it for him. Unfortunately for him it's the dawn of sound and his film is silent. His livein lover Welch is a grateful and loyal but restless sexpot who he mistreats regularly and increasingly as his career dwindles. Together Coco and Welch host this bash and soon find that the studio heads are more interested in other parties or in hooking up with loose women on the premises. King plays a hot new actor who's brought to the party by starlet Bolling who is one of Welch's best friends. Once he eyes Welch King can think of virtually nothing else the rest of the night. Meanwhile Ferra a teenage girl has come to show Coco her talent in dancing never dreaming of all the angst and drama unfolding in the house. Eventually the party escalates into a near fullon orgy and the divergent personalities clash ending in violence. Coco gives an extremely strong performance in one of his better roles. His desperation is palpable and he gets to show both his comic and dramatic skills through the framework of the film. Welch is attractive but very plastic and anachronistic. She never seems genuine at any point in the film. Her character is supposed to be acting like a content and secure hostess but Welch carries this facade throughout the entire film with only occasional lapses into realism. She also performs a couple of sexy but largely inappropriate dance numbers. King provides a welcome does of male sex appeal. His angular features are a perfect contrast to the rotund Coco and he shows off his enticing physique in one key scene. Dukes Bolling and Dano as Coco's longtime chauffeur do well in their respective roles as well. The biggest problem with the film is that nothing wild happens until it is almost over! The period costuming and decor are interesting and there are some good moments along the way but the highflying wildness is not in evidence at all until over an hour into it. Then when the debauchery starts it is pretty tame all things considered certainly compared to the REAL parties of 1920's and 1930's Hollywood! Those familiar with the Arbuckle case may be expecting the story to take a different turn than it does. It's actually a pleasant surprise when things don't go exactly as one might be anticipating but the major catalyst for the violence at the end isn't even shown! A particular lovers tryst is only alluded to. A whimsical score with some clever songs good acting by Coco and the attractiveness of Welch and King are the primary assets here. It's not bad but it could have been much better.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Wild Party is probably based on several wild parties and scandals which took place during Hollywood's silent era when movie stars could do almost anything they wanted behind closed doors without having to worry too much of exposure as there were no real tabloid magazines at the time. James Coco plays a washedup silent movie comic who throws a wild party at his home thinking it will save his career but doesn't count on the extent of depravity of some of his guests. At times the film is highly realistic and makes you wonder about current Hollywood parties and what really goes on between costars. The film has a great 1920's look and the music also adds to the feel. The film is hard to define. It's sort of a historical drama crossed with black comedy but a pretty good one at that.".

When he realizes that he has no backers for his new film and his mistress Queenie has run off with Perry King he stands on the landing of his staircase and drunkenly berates the remaining guests at his party. The funny thing is that the camera never moves nor are there any cutaways from him. He just goes on and on when someone should have yelled cut. Raquel Welch's musical numbers were I suppose meant to entice lusty revelry among the guests but she's not that talented. Leave that sort of thing to Mae West. The whole project smacks of GolanGlobus amateur theatrics. Bad writing bad acting bad lighting bad cinematography.".

More specifically it's based on a hideously maudlin poem by Joseph Moncure March published in 1928. The IvoryMerchant team so famous for its impeccable period detail in any number of films totally flops in capturing the 1929 Holly glam look. What they did capture is the 1975 look. James Coco stars as Jolly Grimm a washed up silent film comic hoping for a comeback in his latest and selfbacked film on the life of Brother Juniper. His livein girlfriend and former extra is played by Raquel Welch. She gets to sing and dance to one of the film's many horrid songs. Perry King plays a flashy new film star Tiffany Bolling plays his jaded party date Bobo Lewis plays the maid Royal Dano plays Tex the former stuntman David Dukes plays the guy who writes the poem. The majority of the cast is unrecognizable. The story hits of just about every stereotype. There's the Valentino type a vamp who's really a lesbian studio heads with thick Euro accents and worst of all is the little puke who'll do anything to get into the movies so she crashes the party and does an Isadora dance draped in dish towels.Everything is wrong although there could have been a decent movie with James Coco and none of the rest of the cast. The costumes are all wrong as is the women's hair and makeup. The several songs are the type that Paul Williams used to sing with that gagworthy diction of his. There are also lots of clips of Coco playing Brother Juniper in the silent movie. As the cannibals trap him and lead him to the giant cauldron Juniper says..... You can't boil me. I'm a friar! And that's the high point of the film.".

She wasn't bad in this picture but with her beauty she shouldn't have been in this movie in the first place. I loss interest in this movie as soon as the person said the year 1920. This movie told you how a movie stars to get his life back once they have been found. However how could you waste the beauty and the talent of Raquel Welch in a movie like this? Raquel body is far better serve on beach scenes and watching walk around the beaches in those short and lovely bikinis. I'm sorry Raquel but I can't give this movie anything more then 3 weasel stars. You and your talent were wasted in this movie and the only reason I gave it 3 weasel stars was because your name was in it.".

	schema:reviewBody "With the advent of newer technology an extremely successful silentfilm actor by the name of Jolly Grimm James Coco has fallen upon hard times and has become quite depressed as a result. So together with his livein girlfriend Queenie Racquel Welch they invite everyone with any clout in Hollywood to their mansion to view his latest work which he hopes will revitalize his career. What Jolly doesn't understand is that the times have passed him by and having lost a great deal of prestige and influence it will take much more flexibility and understanding on his part to handle the situation. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought Racquel Welch put on an excellent performance and demonstrated her abilities quite nicely. Likewise I also thought James Coco performed rather well despite being somewhat miscast in his particular role as it just didn't fit his screen persona. Aside from that the film itself suffered from poor directing and a very convoluted plot with the orgy scene at the end being particularly disgusting. That being said had it not been for both of the aforementioned actors I would have rated this film even lower as it was a depressing and disappointing film.".

Royal Dano was excellent as befits his long and distinguished career as a character actor.It has been a long time since I have seen a film with Raquel Welch.

For James Bond fans this obscure film has definite curiosity value for the presence of Adolfo Celi Largo in Thunderball and Daniela Bianchi Tatiana in From Russia With Love. Let me clear this up Celi has a totally disposable part that could be played by anyone. But Bianchi although it takes a while for her to appear has an important role as an agent with shifty loyalties and she even gets to fire a machine gun  that's almost worth the price of admission right there!. I personally found her better  and more beautiful  here than she was in From Russia With Love. The film begins as a rather unfunny slapstick comedy Gassman falls down on the snow a lot  ha ha ha but after about 30 minutes the plot actually gets intriguing and almost dreamily weird. In the second half it becomes a slightly more serious spy comedy with lots of twists and turns. Overall it's worth a look the print I saw had pretty atrocious picture quality but you get used to it after a while. I doubt we'll ever see a remastered version of this one.  out of 4.".
