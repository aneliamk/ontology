The Count's son wants to marry Louise who thinks her mother is part of New York City society.

	schema:reviewBody "With Pockeful Of Miracles Frank Capra remakes his own Lady For A Day with Capraseque results  that means a mix bag with mostly delightful stuff in it  The major problem here is Glenn Ford not as an actor but as a producer. There is too much dedicated to Ford's character's businesses moving away from what really matters  Apple Annie and her predicament. Bette Davis was one of the major supporters of Glenn Ford at the beginning of his career  A Stolen Life did for his career what Thelma and Louise did for Brad Pitt's and one should remember that Davis sort of imposed Ford for that role. Now Glenn Ford bills himself above Bette Davis. That should tell you something. The film however more than survives the petty egos and comes out as a wonderful swan song for the extraordinary Frank Capra. Bette Davis herself confessed to have found enormous difficulty at being faithful to Apple Annie in those gorgeous gowns postmakeover but this is was and always will be a fairy tale and as such it succeeds beautifully. The entrance of Davis after the makeover scored with the Nutcracker suite it's one of my most cherished movie memories as are Davis's eyes as she witnesses the miracle in first person. A collection of wonderful character actors Thomas Mitchell Ellen Corby and in particular Edward Everett Horton makes the whole thing a smashing pleasure. Beautiful Hope Lange is terrific and Peter Falk wears a coat that makes his character a shady relative of his future Colombo. If you're not made of stone andor your levels of cynicism have not reached inhuman stages you're going to enjoy this very much. I certainly did.".

	schema:headline " Remake edges out original with comedy and different slant";
	schema:reviewBody "The source for this movie is a Damon Runyon short story Madame La Gimp. It was first made into a movie in 1933 entitled Lady for a Day. Frank Capra directed that film which received four Academy Award nominations for the then secondtier Hollywood studio Columbia. Here Capra produced and directed the remake with an independent company set up for that purpose. Pocketful of Miracles received three Oscar nominations. This movie has a lot of history behind it  Capra's desire to remake it different scripts and studio interests different casting conflicts between stars etc. Some of the reviews I've read seem to have been influenced more by that history than by the product itself. I've read much of the background. I've watched and enjoyed very much the original Lady for a Day. I was in the Army when this film came out and we didn't get to see movies until long after they came out. So it was some years later before I first saw Pocketful of Miracles on TV. I now have it on DVD in my film collection. I think I can see why Capra wanted to remake the movie  and in its original setting and time the 1930s. Lady for a Day was a very good film. But Capra was only director  he didn't have control over the script or some of the casting. In Pocketful of Miracles Capra was in charge from the beginning. Glenn Ford was his partner in producing the film and had the male lead. But it was Capra's baby from the start. It's too bad that there were personality conflicts between some of the actors and that Capra had to endure the infighting. But it's as much an accolade to Hollywood and the acting profession that we viewers don't see any of that in the finished product. Instead what we see is a delightful whimsical fairytale of a story. Capra has changed the tone and mood of the original film so much that we see here a completely different story of an almost identical plot. Mary Robson was wonderful as the first Apple Annie. She seemed to be a pathetic character a product of misfortune and the times. Bette Davis on the other hand while a product of the times seems to relish her position in society. She puts a little more life into the character  very appropriate for this second film version. Warren William is good as Dave the Dude but we don't know what the big deal is that distracts him once in a while. And he and his gang are wont to use the artillery from time to time. Very believable for the times I think. Glenn Ford's Dave the Dude is much more a man of pride who's gang doesn't wield guns so much as muscle. He has connections and Ford gives a bravado to the character that fits beautifully into the comedic role. Anyway the entire cast is superb in this film. And it's a cast of many notable actors. This is an entertaining film all around and one the whole family should enjoy.".

I admire the transformation of Bette Davis great work along with wardrobe and make up departments! Last Capra's film it has the typical characteristics of his career.

	schema:reviewBody "Pocketful of Miracles is Frank Capra's Technicolor remake of his brilliant 1933 film Lady for a Day. The same enchanting story only this time set during the Christmas season for delivering a miracle to the greyhaired Cinderella. The remake is rather brash and a little dragging in places when compared to the original nevertheless still an entertaining and fun film. Bette Davis turns in a good portrayal of Apple Annie as does Glenn Ford playing gangster Dave the Dude. Peter Falk makes the most of his role his performance of Joy Boy is absolutely superb. Beautiful Hope Lange plays Dude's girl Queenie Martin and the film debut of a very young AnnMargret playing Apple Annie's charming daughter Louise. What really makes this film fun is a host of amazing character actors of the time Edward Everett Horton Mickey Shaughnessy Sheldon Leonard Thomas Mitchell Ellen Corby Arthur O'Connell and many more recognizable faces. Although I prefer the original 1933 film this 1961 remake adequately exudes its own amount of charm.".

While his earlier version LADY FOR A DAY was more compact this one runs 40 minutes too long extends scenes that could have trimmed the fat off the plotting and still have had the film look great and seems too fairytale even for 1961 when it was released. Somehow what worked so well in the 30s fails to work here and while the acting couldn't be better from many of the actors involved the storyboarding itself is subpar.

Films of this era were about escapism from the harsh reality of the world outside the theater. They were a kind of childish hope for a world that could never be for the audience of that time. That said Bette Davis gives a fantastic performance in this film. I watched it over and over again just to see the master at her craft. She plays the last half of the film as if she's stunned in a dream state unable to quite grasp the kindness shown her. An element of fear of being found out trying to pull off the elegance of a lady of stature yet never loosing the the character of the first half of the film. She manages to pull off being a lady more from being shell shocked than from any real attempt by her character to try to be something she is not. I half hoped she would tell the truth to the count toward the end. Its a lovely film and is right up there with I remember Momma as one of my favorite films of this time. One thing I didn't quite understand that I hope someone here might can help me with. I have a 30 year old TV so I have a authentic experience watching these old movies. I suppose. The problem being the sound quality is horrible. That may have more to do with my aging ears but I'd rather blame it on the set.As a result I missed a lot of dialog toward the end and I couldn't figure out what the payoff for attending the party was for the Mayor and Governor. I felt as if an entire scene were missing between Dude and the officials. Did he turn in the mob boss he had been hauling around in the semi? Did he give himself up? Or was this just a Capra miracle that is never quite explained and we're to think that they were touched by Apple Annies story and wanted to do the right thing by her? I'm interested in what others with better viewing equipment took away from the end of this film.".

While I immensely enjoyed his 'It Happened One Night' his 'It's a Wonderful Life' it has been said that this is Capra's best work did not appeal to me. A 'Pocketful of Miracles' is more of a fairy tale comedy. The title highly appealed to me and how can one say no to a film with Frank Capra and Bette Davis? The film isn't without its share of drawbacks so let's get those out of the way. At times I felt the focus was too much on the Dude when it should have delved deeper into Apple Annie and her struggle. I also thought the ending was slightly rushed and I really wanted to see more of what happened to Apple Annie and the others.The strength of 'Pocketful of Miracles' is its original humour. The writing especially of the dialogues is terrific. The characters are a delight. All the actors are superb. Bette Davis is amazing and even though her character isn't fully fleshed in the second half she performs with grace and poise. Glenn Ford is quite good. Hope Lange is stunning. Ann Margret is cute. Peter Falk provides some great laugh out loud moments. Thomas Mitchell Ellen Corby and Edward Everett Horton are great.In addition 'Pocketful of Miracles' is very pleasing to the eyes. The colourful sets flashy costumes and lavish interiors that highlight the glamour are very appealing.With this heartwarming swansong Capra has made me laugh out loud for more than two hours and that more than compensates for the flaws. What a way to say farwell.".

The original movie starred May Robson and Warren William both largely forgotten today except among classic film fans. This one has more wellknown stars Bette Davis and Glenn Ford but isn't as good. It just isn't as much fun and doesn't have the same heartwarming quality the original did. Davis and Ford are okay but represent a change in the times I'd say. Davis' Annie is ghoulish and Ford's Dave is hard to like. The charm of the previous film made in a much different era for filmmaking is gone. Also the original movie was made during the period it was set in which gave it a feeling of authenticity this one doesn't have. On the plus side Peter Falk and Hope Lange are good in supporting parts AnnMargret is fine in her screen debut and reliable vet Thomas Mitchell enjoyable as ever in his final film. Lots of old familiar faces like Sheldon Leonard Edward Everett Horton Barton MacLane and Jerome Cowan is another plus. It's overlong and not among Capra's best but certainly something fans will want to see. I recommend seeking out the 1933 classic first though.".

	schema:reviewBody "Runyonesque era films rarely interest me. I made an exception for the Clan in Robin And The Seven Hoods.I didn't expect this film to catch my fancy either but there are enough unique aspects to this film to make it well worthwhile watching.1. This has to be the strangest choice of a role ever made by Bette Davis. Even stranger than Baby Jane. So it's worth watching this film just to see Bette Davis in this most unique role. And although it certainly plays against her type she does superbly.2. This was the last film project for director Frank Capra. And yes it is Capracorn but I usually enjoy Capracorn.3. This was also the last film for the wonderful character actor Thomas Mitchell a veteran of Capra films including Lost Horizon.4. A good performance by Hope Lange.5. The big screen debut of AnnMargaret.6. An elderly Edward Everett Horton another veteran of other Frank Capra films going way back to Lost Horizon. Not to mention a number of other wellrecognizable character actors.So what's to criticize? Well it is a bit longish  216 minutes and I think some of the early scenes could have been edited a big. And the ending seemed hurried and a bit illogical. Aside from that if you like Runyonesque stories  and perhaps even if you don't  you should give this film a look. As I indicated there are many unique features to it...enough to make it nearly an historic film.".

I made an exception for the Clan in Robin And The Seven Hoods.I didn't expect this film to catch my fancy either but there are enough unique aspects to this film to make it well worthwhile watching.1. This has to be the strangest choice of a role ever made by Bette Davis. Even stranger than Baby Jane. So it's worth watching this film just to see Bette Davis in this most unique role. And although it certainly plays against her type she does superbly.2. This was the last film project for director Frank Capra. And yes it is Capracorn but I usually enjoy Capracorn.3. This was also the last film for the wonderful character actor Thomas Mitchell a veteran of Capra films including Lost Horizon.4. A good performance by Hope Lange.5. The big screen debut of AnnMargaret.6. An elderly Edward Everett Horton another veteran of other Frank Capra films going way back to Lost Horizon. Not to mention a number of other wellrecognizable character actors.So what's to criticize? Well it is a bit longish  216 minutes and I think some of the early scenes could have been edited a big. And the ending seemed hurried and a bit illogical. Aside from that if you like Runyonesque stories  and perhaps even if you don't  you should give this film a look. As I indicated there are many unique features to it...enough to make it nearly an historic film.";

Producer Roger Corman set out to make a film based on the notorious CaliforniaBased ''Hell's Angels'' motorcycle gang having seen a cover story about them in Life Magazine.Legendary ''B'' movie studio American International Pictures was just as anxious to jump on the ''Biker Bandwagon'' they eventually produced or distributed eleven more films on this subject and gave the OK to Corman. Though George Chakiris ''West Side Story'' Oscar Winner was originally cast in the lead role it was Peter Fonda who ended up playing the part. Playing his ''Old Lady'' was Nancy Sinatra who was then riding high with her hit single ''These Boots Are Made For Walkin'.Bruce Dern played ''The Loser'' the part originally intended for Fonda and Dern's then wife Diane Ladd portrayed his onscreen spouse. There were a few familiar faces among the supporting actors as well including Gayle Hunnicutt in an early appearance and Assistant Director Peter Bogdonavich who is glimpsed in the climactic brawlas is Corman himself. The story itself is really just a loosely connected series of incidents which allow the viewer to follow the ''Angel's'' exploits as if they were viewing a Documentary about the gang. Since ''The Wild One''aside this was the film that started the whole ''Cycle'' cycle it's not surprising that it has a very experimental feel to it.The location photography is excellent and belies the brief three week shooting schedule while the musical score written by future AIP Biker music stalwart and future Lieutenant Governor Mike Curb is dynamic and fits the visuals like a glove. The same goes for the group ''Davie Allan And The Arrows'' who perform it. In fact ''Blues Theme'' was a hit single for the group and the Soundtrack Album proved so popular that a second volume was released. Both records in fact started the ''Motorcycle Soundtrack'' craze most of which were released on Curb's ''TowerSidewalk'' labels a Capitol Records affiliate during the 60's. The actors themselves are not given much opportunity to spread their wings and fly so to speak but under the circumstances they do all right. Dern is especially convincing as ''The Loser'' and Ladd evokes the sympathy her character calls for. Fonda is a bit weak as ''Heavenly Blues'' the leader but Sinatra makes a pretty tough ''Momma'' and though her natural beauty is downplayed she is still very easy on the eyes.Upon it's release the lowbudget film proved enormously popular AIP'S biggest hit so far and convinced them to launch a whole series of ''Protest'' films. A wise decision on their part because they kept the studio in the profit margin for years to come. The Biker genre would have it's share of hits and misses and thanks to a few PovertyRow independent productions like ''The Hellcats'' ''The Rebel Rousers'' and ''The Cycle Savages'' starring Dern all of which made this one seem fairly lavish by comparison it had petered out by the early seventies. Nevertheless ''The Wild Angels'' and a few successors like ''Devil's Angels'' and ''Born Losers'' both released in 1967 remain among the most popular''B'' films of their era.".

As the saying goes Good quick and cheap  pick two. This film however wasn't inexpensive according to Corman standards  it cost almost 1 million to make and it raked in over 3 million in its first week alone with many bikers rolling in to drivein cinemas to see it.For 1966 the content people clad in swastikas partying and drinking their lights out in a protestant church women scantily clad in their underwear passing the occasional joint and 2 inexplicit rape sequences was obviously a shocker. Today a film like this would have been ten times more disguisting and explicit and the church scene would be milked for it's offensive potential and it wouldn't be able to earn the profit this one did given today's consolidated theater market.The film's visual style is exciting with some interesting camera movement and handheld camerawork lending a documentary feel complete with soft focus shots. The soundtrack does not feature any exciting 60's music only the usual film score by a jazzy rock band. The performances are not as bad as the dialogue itself  if the judges at the Venice Film Festival spoke English it is unlikely this film would have made it in. Peter Fonda does not come off as a great Hell's Angel and his performance is on the stiff side probably afraid of how his dad might react. However this film  and Corman's next film The Trip  inspired Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper to make Easy Rider which Corman tried to help finance a considerably better developed more meaningful picture than this one  in all departments.".

	schema:headline " Corman really let's loose with no holes barred look at biker gang";
	schema:reviewBody "This is arguably the quintessential exploitation film that doesn't rely on a mainstream story to fulfill the audiences and instead gives a sordid and narcissistic look at a wild gang of bikers. Story is about the leader of the Venice Hell's Angels named Heavenly Blues Peter Fonda who tells his biker pal Loser Bruce Dern that they might have found his stolen chopper in a nearby town called Mecca. They and the other members go there and confront the Mexican gang that are responsible and a big brawl erupts that brings the cops but everyone runs off except Loser who steals a cops motorcycle. During a chase on the highway Loser gets shot in the back and is caught by the police who put him in a hospital in critical condition.SPOILER ALERTThe Hell's Angels read about Loser in the paper and Blues decides to get him out with the help of his girlfriend Mike Nancy Sinatra and after they sneak him out they take him back to his girl Gaysh Diane Ladd. Everyone watches Loser bleed to death and since the police are looking for them they decide to have a funeral in a small town where they won't be found but at the funeral the Hell's Angels assault the preacher and start a wild drunken orgy. This was one of the last times that Roger Corman directed a film for a long time and it was because of the way that the distributor wanted to promote his film so after this he started his own company. This is so much more than an exploitation flick and Corman pulls no punches with this story as every character seems to lack any type of integrity. Fonda's character is the leader but he's such a brooder that most of the time he seems annoyed by everyone and that includes his girlfriend. The gang here is portrayed ruthlessly and during the funeral while Ladd is weeping over the body of Dern a few members grab her and rape her behind the coffin! Then when they're done they wave over some others so that they can have a chance. This gang has emblems such as iron crosses and swastikas adorned on them and they yell about just being left alone to do what they want and not be hassled by The Man. Corman allows the film to end without any message as the characters are involved in another brawl and he doesn't want to showcase these bikers as lost youth or some such nonsense but instead chooses to make a film that will exploit them and also scare audiences. One of the interesting things about these films from the 1960's is to see what certain cities looked like back then such as Palm Springs and Venice with the canals before the condos were built. Other known actors have small roles such as Michael J. Pollard Norman Alden Frank Maxwell and of course Dick Miller. In his own way Corman changed the way films were to be made and not just in an exploitation manner but with showing characters as antisocial and rebellious and omitting the usual message that they supposedly learn from.

	onyx:emotionText "This is arguably the quintessential exploitation film that doesn't rely on a mainstream story to fulfill the audiences and instead gives a sordid and narcissistic look at a wild gang of bikers. Story is about the leader of the Venice Hell's Angels named Heavenly Blues Peter Fonda who tells his biker pal Loser Bruce Dern that they might have found his stolen chopper in a nearby town called Mecca. They and the other members go there and confront the Mexican gang that are responsible and a big brawl erupts that brings the cops but everyone runs off except Loser who steals a cops motorcycle. During a chase on the highway Loser gets shot in the back and is caught by the police who put him in a hospital in critical condition.SPOILER ALERTThe Hell's Angels read about Loser in the paper and Blues decides to get him out with the help of his girlfriend Mike Nancy Sinatra and after they sneak him out they take him back to his girl Gaysh Diane Ladd. Everyone watches Loser bleed to death and since the police are looking for them they decide to have a funeral in a small town where they won't be found but at the funeral the Hell's Angels assault the preacher and start a wild drunken orgy. This was one of the last times that Roger Corman directed a film for a long time and it was because of the way that the distributor wanted to promote his film so after this he started his own company. This is so much more than an exploitation flick and Corman pulls no punches with this story as every character seems to lack any type of integrity. Fonda's character is the leader but he's such a brooder that most of the time he seems annoyed by everyone and that includes his girlfriend. The gang here is portrayed ruthlessly and during the funeral while Ladd is weeping over the body of Dern a few members grab her and rape her behind the coffin! Then when they're done they wave over some others so that they can have a chance. This gang has emblems such as iron crosses and swastikas adorned on them and they yell about just being left alone to do what they want and not be hassled by The Man. Corman allows the film to end without any message as the characters are involved in another brawl and he doesn't want to showcase these bikers as lost youth or some such nonsense but instead chooses to make a film that will exploit them and also scare audiences. One of the interesting things about these films from the 1960's is to see what certain cities looked like back then such as Palm Springs and Venice with the canals before the condos were built.

	schema:reviewBody "This Roger Corman's classic was the first movie to portray the biker culture of Southern Calfornia in a modern way. Peter Fonda portrayed a character that had refined good looks that never appeared in any biker movies before. Together they revolutionized the image of bikers on a chopper forever.The biker leader Heavenly Blues Peter Fonda thinks he knows where his biker pal Loser's stolen bike is located. The gang goes out to vandalize the place where they suspect the bike is being kept. Two motorcycle cops shows up to check on the suspicious activity. They see the cops approaching and flees including Loser who steal one of the police officer's bike. The other officer pursues him and when he catches up shoots him in the back. In the process the officer mishandles his bike and falls into the canyon. Loser gets apprehended few miles down the highway by a police road block.He gets taken in to the hospital but later that night the gang comes to smuggle him out. Loser is critically wounded and dies at home of a biker friend. The gang decides to drop the body at mortuary and later takes Loser's corps to a church for wild funeral party where they end up beating up the pastor. By now the police is on to them and as they go to the cemetery to bury Loser's body they hear the cop's siren approaching.This film was like a prototype for the movie The Easy Rider. If you take Blues Peter Fonda character from this movie and have him appear as the same person only a year or so later in the Easy Rider the transition won't look so unnatural. The two movies could have been done as part 1 and 2 of the same story. That's how similar the two movies are.What's striking about this film is how good Peter Fonda looks as a Hells Angels biker. I'm sure that no one from that era could have done as good a job as him in his role. Another thing that was cool about this film was the theme song that was composed by former MGM CEO Mike Curb in his heydays as rock composer Mike Curb  Davie Allan and The Arrows. Sound track album for this movie contained many more good songs than what was featured on the film.I remember this movie showing in 1966 at a movie theater called Midway on Queens Boulevard in New York.Many of the actors who starred in this movie are still active today Including its director Roger Corman. Which shows Roger Corman had an eye for talent. This movie was was a cultural milestone and without it I doubt if the Easy Rider would have been born. Country that can make a movie like this is a cool country. A country that was America. It's unfortunate that it is forgotten now as memory of the past era.".

This is a surprise as the film seems to be a denouncement of this kind of lifestyle. This was a surprise to me as I was thinking that we would be rooting for the motorcycle people against the man. Perhaps however 1966 when the film was made would be different from 1968.The first time we should realize that we should not be for Heavenly Blues Peter Fonda and his gang is when they attack some Mexican youths in a garage. Roger Coorman emphasizes the size differences between the two groups the all white gang being much bigger than the Mexicans with Heavenly Blues using racially derogatory comments towards the Mexicans. Later one of his gang members will try to rape an African American nurse with Heaveny Blues intervening not out of honorable reasons but just to get the hell out of the hospital and not get caught.The police in the film are portrayed rather decently. In the hospital the officer guarding the Loser Played by Bruce Dern is portrayed as a caring person polite to the African American nurse and concerned about the so called Sister of the Loser Played by Nancy Sinatra. The police are never shown as being brutal authority figures but just as people trying to keep things in a peaceful way.Bruce Derns name in the film The loser is apt for the whole group. They are in fact portrayed as losers. They're only goal In life is to ride free and get stoned. They are shown to be able to be exploited by unscrupulous people such as the Funeral arranger. When at the end the police are on the way Nancy Sinatra tells Fonda's character lets get away He responds for the first time with any real sense of his own life there is no where to go. They all leave but he continues to dig the grave for The loser he could be actually digging his own grave.It is during the church scene where the audience will find these characters repugnant. You don't have to be religious to do so. At the end of the film you are going to be rooting for the townspeople watching the ridiculous funeral procession to attack the motor cycle gang. Coorman bookends the film interesting here. At the beginning we saw a young boy on a tricycle. At the end of the film as I recall it is a young boy who throws an object at the motor cycle gang in the cemetery.I happened to watch the film by chance on one of those on demand free cable stations. I can't say I was totally entertained by the film. It seems somewhat dated now. But it did surprise me and I would have to suggest that their was a message in the film and a rather strong one.".

Sadly this movie The Wild Angels is just the most recent in the string of trash I have unwittingly subjected myself to. It is simplistic and stupid and can be summarized in one short paragraph.

Peter and his pals take him away from the hospital and he later dies. At his funeral Peter and friends trash the church and have a party. Later at the burial a small boy throws a rock at one of the bikers. Everyone gets mad and attacks the crowd of townspeople. The police come and all of Peter's chums run away and Peter is left alone to bury his friend. The end. Was that short enough? Anyway the characters were all obnoxious punks that I couldn't possibly root for. Fonda looks atrocious in his biker punk get up and the whole film is less interesting than watching an old lady knit for 86 minutes. This is the worst film I've seen in quite some time and that's saying a lot from me considering the stuff I watch.".

They had just attended the funeral of one of their friends at which they smashed up the church raped his girlfriend pulled the dead guy out his coffin stuck a cigarette in his mouth and pushed the preacher into the coffin instead.I've rarely seen a film that made me feel such contempt for the main protagonists. I think the closing shot of Fonda standing alone in the graveyard was meant to be deep and meaningful. It wasn't.The only reason I would recommend this film is for the same reason I watched it. To see the film that Primal Scream sampled for their classic hit Loaded. Having seen it I can't for the life of me imagine why they did.".

Another trademark with this type of film is the fact that he and other lowbudget directors rely on the children of Hollywood legends Peter Fonda Nancy Sinatra to attract an audience. This is an okay film and the Peter Bogdanovich's script is pretty decent. The only thing though is that it relied too much on the action to carry the story. Also the women in this film are mainly used as window dressing. In fact I don't think Nancy Sinatra had more than ten lines of dialogue in the whole picture. At least Dianne Ladd had more to say. However the thing I loved the most about the film is the score which was one of the first examples of what would become heavy metal.".

Lot of the rest of this movie is cheesy trivial and so I remembered today this wonderful scene of terror and an actor in his best form. I don't speak from Peter Fonda he is only solid like Nancy Sinatra too the guy is Bruce Dern one of the most underrated actors of UScinema. My rating is six of out ten stars because this picture was with Dern and also created the new genre of motorcyclefilms. Marlon Brando as the leading actor in The Wild One didn't have the influence for cinema nor for the fifties or for the sixties like this  sorry  in the sum very very average picture.".

Fonda has one good nonconformist speech during Losers funeral which is then ruined by the subsequent trashing of the churchall because the minister had the nerve to invoke the name of god in his eulogy. Go figure. This poor display of social grace is reminiscent of the juvenile delinquents in Blackboard Jungle when they trash the teacher's priceless blues collection. I had the same sick feeling after that. Just then I looked over at my girl friend and saw a scowl creased in her face. She was in total disbelief at the way these nihilistic nitwits treated the minister. So was I. And she likes The Born Losers and Billy Jack. It's truly amazing that Fonda Dern Ladd and the others survived this debacle. I know Frank Sinatra must have been appalled that his daughter would appear in such cinematic rubbish. I had a devil of a time collecting my thoughts in writing this review. I needed a long shower afterward. Or a drink stiffer than Loser.".

Along with that some films even have a solid cast and still messed it up somehow. It should make viewers wonder to themselves what the heck possessed these actors to take part in such strange concoctions. In this mid 1960s film Roger Corman the man best known for The Little Shop of Horrors 1960 is in the director's chair. Starring in the film is a young Peter Fonda and Nancy Sinatra. Together these two actors head a biker gang known as The Wild Angels based on an actual biker group Hell's Angels.It's after the rolling intro credits where the narrative is lost. Credited as the socalled writer to this movie is Charles B. Griffith a man who has produced several other works with Corman. Why didn't Corman see how bad the screenplay was? There is literally no part of the plot that is engaging enough for any audience. The only thing that is presented is the behavior of this gang which doesn't help. The behavior of the gang is reckless brash and even stupid. In one scene a bunch of bonehead bikers hop on their bikes to chase a rabbit. A rabbit.The mentality of this gang is to be free and ride their machines without having to answer to the man. You know the basic 60s perspective of most rebels. Roger Corman may have been trying to get this message across but it is done in such a way that is so late in the running time that by the time the topic is brought up the audience will already be asleep. It's almost like he was just trying to capitalize on the craze at the time. Let's also not forget the symbol of The Wild Angels  the Swastika? Yeah just how exactly is portraying this in any film other it being about Nazis or Charles Manson sound like a good idea? Point being it isn't. No one should be proud to represent that symbol. How is that Peter Fonda Nancy Sinatra and others found it to be a wise career choice?The dialog isn't anything special either. The characters have no meat to them. Plus there are little to any characterizations among the leads that are presented to the viewers. Peter Fonda's character says Shut Up way too often. Nancy Sinatra's character keeps asking if Fonda's character still loves her and he can't make up his mind. Nothing is explained to why the characters act the way they do on a personal level. The sole activities that matter to this group of neanderthals is riding their bikes getting high getting laid and having meaningless brawls. None of it is appealing all the way up to the very last minute of the film. Michael J. Pollard best known for his role in Tango  Cash 1989 as Owen even has a role and can't help lift the entertainment level. Forget background music nowhere close to being on target with the tone of the film. No wonder the real Hell's Angels filed a lawsuit!A story barely exists here. The characters are as transparent as glass the music is irrelevant and the events that take place are meaningless.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Wild Angels' was start of AIP's and Roger Corman's counterculture and biker films that itself grew into popular subgenre in late '60s and early '70s.Screenplay of 'The Wild Angels' is as empty as it's characters. I have no idea how accurately the film depicts the life of biker gang but I can imagine that there are quite many boneheads in that subculture. We are introduced to Blues Peter Fonda and Loser Bruce Dern and their girlfriends Mike Nancy Sinatra and Gaysh Diane Ladd. At first it seems that Blues has more substance than some of his fellow gang members as he stays cool and thoughtful guy at the beginning. He is a criminal like everyone else with no respect towards the law but his quiet posture gives him somewhat intelligent appearance but it starts to wear off as the story moves along until near the end in the funeral scene when the pastor asks him what it is you want to do? And Blues says after stuttering that he wants to be free to do what we want and all that empty talk. With this immature answer he proves that he has no idea what he wants from life. Add to Fonda's wooden acting and you get a laughable scene with laughable speech that only some naive teenagers might find cool. Peter Fonda is terrible he oozes coolness sitting on his bike and wearing sunglasses but when he opens his mouth that illusion washes away.Although the screenplay is shallow and acting is passable at best the direction by Corman is smooth and the pacing is perfect that the film doesn't feel dragging. Smooth bike riding scenes accompanied with cool soundtrack make 'The Wild Angels' one of the best examples of style over substance.Recommended to everyone who are interested where the biker movie craze started. The direct inspiration to 'Easy Rider'.".

	schema:reviewBody "A beautiful movie with a mostly Alist cast far superior to the  source novel.  Strange Cargo has almost nonstop action yet the central allegory is never lost in action nor is the storyline swamped by allegory.  In less capable hands it might've been a maudlin movie but instead is a finely crafted parable where a mysterious Christlike figure Hunter introduced while taking Clark Gable's place in a prisoner headcount accompanies and guides a mixednut boatload of escapees from Devil's Island.  He's never an intrusive or moralizing figure nor does he employ clever wordplay or ecstatic preachments but assists each of the escapees as each individually confronts the internal corruption that led them to Devil's Island  and the film's makers have the courage to show some of the men dealing with that confrontation and some turning away from it without giving judgment to the rightness or wrongness of either choice.  This movie proves the potential for making a truly solid entertaining and nonmawkish movie on orthodox Christian themes without the foolish baggage of robes and sandals or insipid and sermony scripts.  The movie's only disappointment is that Peter Lorre is not one of the escapees but a loathsome bounty hunter who has too few scenes.  His character doesn't appear in the book but deepens the parable.  Overall Strange Cargo is a movie that can be enjoyed for the plot alone but which courageously adds layers like those of an onion that can be savored by the discerning.  It's astounding this movie hasn't become a cult favorite but perhaps its tendency to prompt introspection isn't much appreciated these days.".

	schema:headline " Worth A Look";
	schema:reviewBody "The aptly titled Strange Cargo is both strange and carries a mixed cargo of entertainment nuggets for the casual viewer. It begins as a prison yarn skirts the boundaries of a religious epic and ultimately winds up a story of redemption for the hero Andre Verne. As portrayed by Clark Gable Verne is tough and cynical not to mention lecherous and selfserving. His conversion is never convincing but how it comes about is both unexpected and unusual for a studio picture from the era.Verne is a tough con who is locked up on the infamous Devil's Island territory that would be trod in further depth in Passage To Marseille with Humphrey Bogart and to a more realistic degree in 1973's Papillon starring Steve McQueen. He is constantly trying to escape so often that he makes the penal colony look like a ramshackle hotel rather than a brutal work camp. During one of his escapes he is replaced in the prison lineup by a mysterious man who calls himself Cambreau and who seemingly materializes out of nowhere. Verne crosses paths with a dancehall tart named Julie Joan Crawford who fires his interest and her scorn. She turns him in but is herself ordered off the island for having spoken to the convict in the first place apparently this is a serious nono. Ultimately Verne joins a prison break that includes Cambreau and he later enlists Julie into the group by some plot turns that will leave a viewer scratching his head. From this point the story switches gears and becomes a story of redemption as Cambreau helps the evil convicts discover the good in their souls before they die off one by one. Julie falls for Verne and he for her although Julie takes it one step further by renouncing the wickedness in her life while failing to persuade Verne to do likewise. After Julie goes off on her own so Verne can escape to America he has an epiphany and returns to prison to finish off his sentence before marrying her.This is the final CrawfordGable picture and while Crawford assumes top billing as she always did Gable is the real star of the film. Hot on the heels of his success in Gone With the Wind he was at the zenith of his popularity while Crawford was on a downward spiral. As Verne Gable is his typical self cocky tough and faithless. While his character comes across as a smug bastard there is no denying the actor's virility and star power. When he is on screen he wipes nearly everyone else off in a fierce display of animal magnetism. Crawford matches him in wisecracks but her subtle underplaying makes her conversion to the righteous life more convincing than his. There is a sadness and weariness to her performance that suggests her character has lost her way in life and is looking for some method of finding herself again. This she does through the mechanizations of Cambreau and it is a tribute to her acting talents that she pulls it off.The supporting cast is uniformly good Peter Lorre is loathsome in a stereotypically slimy role as the prison stooge while Paul Lukas is chilling as the evil Hessler a murderer of rich women. However it is the performance of Ian Hunter as Cambreau that is the gem in this film. There has been debate about who Cambreau is and to be sure the movie doesn't come out an say it but to me it is obvious he is Jesus Christ. He has come to redeem Verne and along the way to provide a righteous path for the other characters in the picture. As played by Hunter the character is saintly without being sappy and inspirational without being corny. His interplay with Hessler on several occasions is extremely interesting and one wishes the film focused on this more. Hessler is referred to as the devil on more than one occasion and in the end he is the only one who does not succumb to Cambreau's powers of persuasion. In their last confrontation Hessler comments on how they may cross paths in the future Cambreau replies in no uncertain terms that they will never meet again. Clearly Hessler is headed South for eternity.Strange Cargo is an interesting movie from a studio system era that was reluctant to take chances with its stories. Here is a film that covers a lot of ideological territory and does so energetically while retaining the starmaking essence of its two leads. On top of this you have a supporting actor stealing the film with a masterful portrayal of Jesus in a modern setting. Enjoy".

	schema:reviewBody "Paradox and Transformation in Strange Cargo David F. Maas davidfmaasyahoo.com Hawkins TexasI have been enthralled by the movie Strange Cargo since seeing it as a nine year old boy on television in the middle 1950's. I purchased my own VHS copy of this movie in 1995 at the age of 51 watching it dozens and dozens of times continually fascinated by the symbolism the philosophical focus and the stark adventure of a bold escape from a jungle penal colony controlled by the French off the coast of Guiana. This summer at the age of 65 I bought a seasoned copy of Richard Sale's novel Not Too Narrow Not Too Deep from Amazon.com hoping to peel off a few more layers of meaning.Surprisingly I concluded that Lawrence Hazard's screenplay was far superior to the Richard Sale novel upon which it was based having a much tighter allegorical construction. Hazard thoroughly deconstructed the novel but stayed faithful to the philosophical core. The screenplay graphically describes the remarkable transformations or conversions from selfish to altruistic life views of six convicts and a sultry nightclub singer escaping to freedom through a dense tropical forest. The catalyst for their transformations is a mysterious Christ figure named Jean Cambreau Ian Hunter. The sultry nightclub singer Julie Joan Crawford ordered off the island by the warden for fraternizing with the prisoners falls in love with a thief Andre Verne Clark Gable after he reads to her the romantic words of Solomon's Song of Songs. She altruistically plans to resign herself to an unhappy marriage with M'sieu Pig Peter Lorre a professional stool pigeon in order to allow Verne to escape. A ruthless killer Moll Albert Dekker altruistically sacrifices his life as he drinks from a cask which has absorbed salt water.Andre Verne who almost escapes to freedom aboard a fishing boat endangers his own life saving Cambreau whom he has moments before attempted to drown. Paradoxically Verne learns that true liberty or freedom consists not in escaping from law but in acquiescing to the law. Instead of deriving satisfaction from coveting and stealing thingshe yielded to a wholesome love relationship and playing by the rules. He learned that when we play by the rules we have freedom right now. Freedom and contentment is a condition independent from circumstances a condition originating in the heart or mind.At the end of the movie Cambreau and the fisherman played by Victor Varconi who nearly brought Andre Verne to freedom had a very telling dialogueFisherman He won't be sorry? Cambreau No fisherman. He won't. Fisherman And everything will be all right for them someday? Cambreau Everything is all rightnow.".

The story is simple French prisoners in French Guyana are tired of the old prison life and routine and eventually make a break for the surrounding jungle amidst virtually no chances of success. We have a rather eclectic group Clark Gable as arrogant as he comes as the head Cheese so to speak Albert Dekker as Moll who is Gable's only real threat for supremacy Paul Lukas as a spousekilling German Joan Crawford as a wisecracking woman fallen on hard timesnever quite sure whether or not it is established that she iswas a prostitute and Ian Hunter in a strange role as some kind of super Christian and Samaritan. Aiding the cast is Peter Lorre as Pig who is after Crawford with a vengeful lust. The story is straightforward but what is not is its intent. Each of these prisoners are troubled men with troubled consciences. Hunter's character is almostor is indeed a Christlike figure out to ease each individual's pain and torment. Some men embrace his message prior to death some live on with the promise of happiness and one ignores it completely and resumes doing what he had that had gotten him into prison. I guess for me the thematically rich substrate is saying something about the importance of choice and the ease in which each of us can be forgiven if only we want to be forgiven. Director Frank Borzage does a decent job with this symbolic material. Some things might just be too ambiguous. But Borzage keeps the pacing going. Probably the most irritating thing for me was Gable's performance. His character is too pushy too cocky too crude to be charming affable or interesting at all. I didn't care what happened to him and routinely rooted against him. Joan Crawford fares much better giving a pretty nice performance with some dimension  though not much. Dekker and Lukas are very good Lorre is good with a throwaway role. For me Ian Hunetr gives the best most interesting and most likable performance as the mouthpiece of Heaven so to speak. His subtle acting really diminishes the possible heavyhandedness inherent in a role like this. Hunter plays his part in a firstrate fashion. Though certainly not one of the greatest films ever made I found Strange Cargo a very interesting movie with a very interesting message.".

	schema:reviewBody "Strange Cargo is a 1940 film starring Joan Crawford and Clark Gable that leaves the usual story lines behind  romantic comedy kept woman rags to riches  as it weaves an allegorical tale of escaping prisoners and a Christlike figure who accompanies them. Gable is Andre Verne a prisoner on Devil's Island who escapes with several other prisoners Paul Lukas Albert Dekker Eduardo Ciannelli J. Edward Bromberg and John Arledge. During the evening count he's almost found missing but another man Cambreau Ian Hunter replaces him in line. He then boards the boat to the mainland with them and Julie Crawford probably a prostitute who is escaping also from a lecherous bounty hunter Peter Lorre.The prisoners fall on hard times as they escape through the woods and also while at sea when their water becomes tainted. Cambreau gives each prisoner comfort and helps them to confront the evil that brought them to Devil's Island helping to bring them peace at last. This is not lost on Julie who sees a chance for redemption. Verne however isn't interested.This is a very simple story beautifully directed by Borzage. The atmosphere of the film is dark and haunting. There is no preachiness. The sheer power of Cambreau and his sense of faith is what brings the prisoners solace. Hunter is majestic in the role. Gable is appropriately tough and Crawford brings depth to Julie who thought she knew what she wanted. The rest of the cast is topnotch.Strange Cargo seems like a film that was made in the early '30s with its Christian parable. This was the last film that Crawford and Gable made together. Its powerful message makes this a fitting ending for a fine MGM team.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Frank Borzage Seventh Heaven Street Angel Lucky Star The Mortal Storm Three Comrades etc. was rather famous for making pictures with a spiritual yet practical edge to them. Here he succeeds once again in Strange Cargo 1940 which almost could have been a precode it was that good.The story involves a group of convicts and a prostitute who are making a break from a prison island to gain their freedom and new lives traveling through dangerous jungles to reach the sea and a waiting boat. Although most of them hate each other at the beginning strange events cause them to reexamine their lives and even make incredible sacrifices for one another along the way.The cast is generally excellent particularly Ian Hunter who plays the good man Cambreau who acts as a Godly peacemaker a Jesus symbol to the evil unsympathetic characters who abound in this film. His character proves that even a mere mortal man with a great and firm faith a man not a priest or a minister could lead sinful people to repentance with gentle words from the scripture and from his personal examples of good deeds. Either that or his character was simply a male angel. The Bible says you can meet angels unawares.This is one reason why I love the movies from old Hollywood they weren't afraid to tackle subjects about spirituality vs. sin. Today they don't think sin exists anymore in Hollywood ha! so there is no need to moralize about anyone's changed behavior.Joan Crawford had some good scenes in this film but it takes awhile for the audience to feel sympathy for her. A couple of times I thought I was watching her again in Rain a film she hated because it didn't do well at the box office. Joan simply does not strike me as a spiritual person so she really had to ACT to play a remorseful person who changed for the better. It never really rings true though although she tried her best.I did enjoy seeing silent film actress Betty Compson even briefly as Joan's friend. How sad that more of her minor sound films have survived but her silent classics have been lost. She was a very big star in her day but by the 1930's she was forced into mostly B pictures.Clark Gable seems an uncouth rough choice for the prisoner Verne and his last scene in the boat with Cambreau made me laugh and I don't feel I should have been laughing at such a dramatic moment. He missed the mark for me. Like Joan I don't think Gable was a spiritual person either so they were a good match here in an odd kind of way. I would really have loved to have seen two other actors play these parts.Perhaps one of the best performances here is from Paul Lukas as Hessler the atheist. It's amazing how quickly I can pick out the atheist characters in films they seem to have a brittle angry edge to them a continual chip on their shoulders they are never at peace and Paul displayed these qualities in abundance in this film. He is the only character who refuses to change after his encounters with Cambreau. Watch his face in his last scene and closeup. For one instant he is reconsidering the path he will take sinner or saint but then shouts No! to himself and walks away angrily into his atheist night. Very powerful and realistic although sad at the same time.Others here raved about Peter Lorre's performance as Pig but it didn't really impress me. His character seemed like just a silly spider in the background one that should have simply been stepped on right at the beginning rather than tolerated for too long. He didn't seem threatening enough to me.Overall a fascinating thought provoking film not for the squeamish. If you are looking for something different and you are not afraid to face your own prejudices against people of faith see Strange Cargo.".

	schema:headline " The Angel of Devil's Island";
	schema:reviewBody "The Strange Cargo referred to in the title is in the person of Ian Hunter who is a mysterious other world convict who comes upon a group of them planning to escape from Devil's Island. It's a strange film Strange Cargo with Clark Gable and Joan Crawford in the very last of eight films they were paired in by MGM.Crawford dusts off her Sadie Thompson role for her character here. Even with the Code firmly in place it's rather obvious that Crawford is a working girl. She's free but stranded on that notorious convict island.

Dekker in fact chooses a gruesome suicide rather than live without Arledge after he dies. In fact what's really startling to me was that the heavenly figure that Ian Hunter represents neither condemns suicide or homosexuality. I'm really wondering how the censors of the day let that one slip through. Paul Lukas has a very interesting part. He's today what we would consider a serial killer he's married and killed many women for their money. He's cool and cynical and rejects Hunter's entreaties. When Hunter says they will never meet again the line is loaded with implications.Strange Cargo is a strange film. It's not bad but could have been a lot better without code restrictions.".

	onyx:emotionText "The Strange Cargo referred to in the title is in the person of Ian Hunter who is a mysterious other world convict who comes upon a group of them planning to escape from Devil's Island. It's a strange film Strange Cargo with Clark Gable and Joan Crawford in the very last of eight films they were paired in by MGM.Crawford dusts off her Sadie Thompson role for her character here. Even with the Code firmly in place it's rather obvious that Crawford is a working girl. She's free but stranded on that notorious convict island. Gable is essentially the same cynical tough guy he played in so many MGM features at that time.Ian Hunter is the mysterious stranger among them. These aren't a group of choir boys he comes among.

	schema:reviewBody "A Joan Crawford film with no gowns by Adrian? Whaaaaaaat?Well Adrian is nowhere to be seen because there are no gowns at all. This is a gritty tale of love  lust between a convict and a goodtime girl a prison break an escape through the jungle a perilous voyage at sea to the mainland and ultimately ... redemption.The first character we meet is Verne Clark Gable as he is released from thirty days of solitary confinement in a penal colony on one of the French Guianas islands off the coast of Brazil. We learn that he has a long history of trying to escape and that the warden has just about given up any hope of reforming him. He gives Verne a work assignment outside the colony loading and unloading cargo down on the docks. Maybe Verne will make a run for it and a guard will shoot him and they'll be done with him.It is there that Verne first gets an eyeful of goodtime girl Julie Joan Crawford. She's there on the dock watching the men work while waiting for her ditzy girlfriend take care of some business on the ship. There's some banter back and forth and he tells Julie he'll meet her later that evening.Verne slips away from the other prisoners on the march back to the colony and a mysterious stranger takes his place. This is the Christlike figure Cambreau Ian Hunter. He ingratiates himself into a small group of men who are planning to break out that evening and goes along with them. Meanwhile Verne did indeed meet Julie in her room but she turned him in to the authorities and he wound up back in prison. He is eager to join his rival Moll and company for their prison break.Then there are complications ...This is a great film. The story is well told the production values are topnotch and the cast is wonderful.Joan and Clark are at the peak of their desirability. This is the film that made me notice Clark Gable. He is devastatingly handsome whether clean shaven with his signature moustache with a little scruff and especially with a full beard. Dang! I wish I could emerge from thirty days of solitary confinement looking that good! Where do I sign up?Joan and Clark also prove their worth as actors. Both have scenes that demand strong emotions and tears and it's about as real as it gets. There's another scene where Julie goes after Verne with a letter opener and a bite and in that moment it's easy to believe she had every intention of stabbing him!The rest of the cast is also at the top of their game. Peter Lorre is wonderful as the moneyhungry  lovesick nightclub owner Pig who wants Julie for his own and isn't above snitching to the law to get rid of his rival.I was intrigued by the strong nonjudgmental subtext of a homosexual relationship between Verne's nemesis Moll Albert Dekker and two younger and more passive prisoners Flaubert and Dufond. They aren't shy about expressing their admiration love? for Moll and Moll talks very tenderly about one of them after his death on the boat. It's obvious that they were more than friends.My only complaint is that it gets a bit preachy towards the end but how could it not given the subject matter and the character Cambreau?This is a film well worth watching if for nothing else than to see Joan Crawford sans Adrian on a boat that isn't a cruise ship!Highly Recommended!".

Still looking quite attractive without much makeup if any Crawford plays an older version of Sadie Thompson Rain a sinner on Devil's Island who is constantly fighting off the advances of a rat M'sieu Pig Peter Lorre the most hated man by prisoners and the warden on the Island. You're the one man I'd never get low enough to touch she tells him. But Clark Gable? Yes in spite of the fact that he's a prisoner she can't deny her animal lust towards him. When brutish Moll Albert Dekker plans an escape he keeps Gable from joining him by smashing his head with his shoe That doesn't keep a movie hero like Gable idle for long and he makes his own escape. Gable  Crawford end up together Gable takes over as commander of the escapee's boat and the other escaped convicts begin to ponder spiritual matters as they face their destiny.This is an extremely enjoyable movie that could have been too preachy if not handled carefully. Not all of the escapees reform or believe in what the truly religious characters are spouting. Ian Hunter's character is truly the most profound and there will be some debate as to who he is supposed to be in the minds of the original writers. Hunter in fact gives the best performance not too holier than thou but certainly the most profound. Paul Lukas the veteran leading man from the early 30's plays a basically nice but moralless man who is in prison for marrying women he then poisons. The others J. Edward Bromberg Eduardo Ciannelli John Aldredge have completely different purposes. As for Peter Lorre this is one of the most vile characters he has ever played and no one plays creepy like Lorre.While this is certainly not a great film it is lavishly produced but is ultimately defeated by the melodramatic screenplay a few onedimensional characters and a bravado of pretentiousness. The chemistry between Gable and Crawford is as affecting as it was in their first film 10 years before although he was happily married to Carole Lombard at this time. Crawford is brave in taking on a role that seemed to go out of style before the production code came in films such as Safe in Hell Panama Flo Anybody's Woman but Gable's overly manly character is lacking much likability. Betty Compson a star from the early 30's has a small role as Crawford's pal at the beginning of the film Her career consisted of roles much like what Crawford is playing here.".

	schema:headline " I love this movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of my favorite movies from the '40s. It's such a strange film for the time. Clark Gable and some other convicts escape from a Devil's Islandtype penal colony. They are joined by a convict Ian Hunter none of them seem to know but who has a strange way about him. Gable also brings along a prostitute Joan Crawford who turned him in on his last escape attempt. The convicts and Joan embark on a dangerous journey to escape the island. Along the way they begin to suspect there is something almost supernatural about Hunter's character. As a matter of fact he is heavily implied to be Jesus Christ! This sounds like something prime for mockery but it actually works really well.Clark Gable is just great in this from a pure entertainment perspective. He spends the whole movie barking at people and being a tough guy. I especially love all of his scenes with Joan Crawford saying things like come here baby and planting one on her. It's a macho cheesy role for Gable but I loved every minute of it. Crawford turns in an underrated performance and looks absolutely stunning. I don't think Joan would ever look this pretty on screen again. The best thing about it is she looks relatively plain here. No shoulder pads no Groucho Marx eyebrows no heavy makeup or matronly hairstyles. She's positively radiant.The cast is amazing. In addition to Gable and Crawford there's Ian Hunter's brilliantly enigmatic turn as Cambreau. Paul Lukas and Albert Dekker turn in two of the best performances of their careers. Peter Lorre plays the creepy Pig who has eyes on Joan. John Arledge is nicely sympathetic as Dekker's friend. There's certainly some room for interpretation with that part of the movie. It's a goodlooking film. Director Frank Borzage never made an ugly movie that I'm aware of. He epitomized MGM glamour. Great Franx Waxman score too. Just a phenomenal movie. Deserves much wider recognition than it has received.".

	schema:reviewBody "Strange Cargo sports an excellent cast and they all do a good job with their roles.But the story is a supernatural one so it does not have to conform with reality anything goes in the plot.The central theme is about man's free willthe ability to choose a path for himself. Each character is given the opportunity to choose between good and evil altruism and greed the commandments and sin.And there is one character who represents goodness. He seems to facilitate their choices but mostly he just watches them makes their choices. He is a witness a representation of someone's concept of an allseeing being. What is nonsensical is his apparent ability to predict future happenings. This is a representation of an allknowing being. Without intending it the author of this plot has created an irreconcilable dichotomyhow does man possess free will if an omniscient being knows what he will do before he does it?The end result is a plot that defies logic. One might ask how the message or story might be changed if the Cambreau witness character were deleted. The other characters could make the same choices without a character predicting their actions. I believe the plot would be even stronger because the witness is merely a distraction. However those who like supernatural stories might prefer the movie as it was filmed.Unfortunately the studio revised the film when pressured by decency groups. So we can not be sure what the studio originally intended.As someone who views every film as s glimpses into the art of its time and the community psyche I won't rate this film too lowly. Technically it has much to recommend it. And I can forgive the few scenes where the heavyhanded religious symbolism is distracting.".

What is nonsensical is his apparent ability to predict future happenings. This is a representation of an allknowing being. Without intending it the author of this plot has created an irreconcilable dichotomyhow does man possess free will if an omniscient being knows what he will do before he does it?The end result is a plot that defies logic. One might ask how the message or story might be changed if the Cambreau witness character were deleted. The other characters could make the same choices without a character predicting their actions. I believe the plot would be even stronger because the witness is merely a distraction. However those who like supernatural stories might prefer the movie as it was filmed.Unfortunately the studio revised the film when pressured by decency groups. So we can not be sure what the studio originally intended.As someone who views every film as s glimpses into the art of its time and the community psyche I won't rate this film too lowly. Technically it has much to recommend it. And I can forgive the few scenes where the heavyhanded religious symbolism is distracting.";

Others have recapped the plot but picking it up midway through it seems a little like Papillon a prison escape movie of the 70's.But there is the omniscient presence here of Ian Hunter's character Cambreau who shows up abruptly but no one seems to know him. He is a mystical figure offering solace and comfort which is not always welcome. One by one as the band of escapees meets their fate he is on hand with gentle words to send them off. He is a hypnotic presence and is the main reason to stick with this movie.Toward the end of this unlikely story things start to run off the tracks. Verne Gable attacks Cambreau on board a boat and chucks him overboard. Cambreau with arms outstretched on a piece of lumber as though crucified thrashes about in the stormy sea. At this point there is no question who his character resembles but Gable's subsequent motivation and transformation toward the end of the picture do not fit his character's mold an ending which is at odds with what we have discerned thus far.Gable is the nominal star but Hunter garners all your attention. Never cared for Joan Crawford but she was good in her role. She played a similar part in Rain 1932 but her character here has more depth. Paul Lukas is also good as one of the escapees. Strange Cargo is worth your time and gets better as it unfolds. It is worth a watch next time it comes on which would probably be on TCM.".

	schema:reviewBody "Clark Gable Verne is a prisoner on Devil's Island who has a track record for making escapes. And getting caught. Joan Crawford Julie is a singer in a bar on the Island. We are not told why she has ended up here but we can guess that she has had a wicked past. When Gable is found in her room she is expelled from the island and told to leave by the same way that she entered meaning illegally through the jungle. She becomes a fugitive along with Gable and a handful of other prisoners as they make an escape attempt. Meanwhile the Prison Commandant Frederick Worlock Grideau awaits them at the port on the mainland that they are heading to along with slimy Peter Lorre Pig whose ulterior motive involves shacking up with an uninterested Crawford.It's an interesting film that concentrates on a set of prisoners whose strange cargo comes in the form of prisoner Ian Hunter Cambreau. He is the allknowing morality man who allows each prisoner to look at themselves and make their peace before heading to their destinies. He appears from nowhere and has a Christlike drowning scene at the end of the film where he hangs on to a cross in stormy waters.At work we used to have a post messenger called 'Verne' who delivered files to our desks twice a day. He used to turn up on our floor and throw them at you believing that was an acceptable way to carry out his duty. He'd just fling them at you and if they missed or hit the floor so be it. Well the way that Gable's portrayal of his character 'Verne' delivers his dialogue is just as brash. He just throws it at you. I didn't find him particularly likable. Gable plays it very macho and spouts a lot of dialogue with the use of the word baby stuck on at the end when he addresses Crawford. Crawford wins the acting award as she provides her character with some depth and you do wonder as to why she has ended up on the island. There seems to be more to her character whereas Gable is just a meathead. He has a rivalry with Albert Dekker Moll for leadership of the escaping group  guess who wins? Unfortunately Dekker ruins his role by attempting an English accent from nowhere. Noone English speaks like that Dekker! I think he was trying cockney? For me the most memorable scene was when murderer Paul Lukas Hessler realizes his destiny. I think the film could have been better if it had concentrated on his character and his unwillingness to play by Hunter's rules. As it is we get a love story playing against this conflict of good versus bad. It makes for a happy Hollywood ending with a morality message but you've got to give full marks to Lukas. Hunter is just not relevant. Another good scene occurs on a boat to the mainland when Gable has to try the infected water. I would have just refused as it means certain death. How will he get out of that one? Perhaps he'll just keep shouting dialogue in a cocky manner as he does in a climatic scene with Ian Hunter during a storm. Terrible acting from Gable.Overall I liked this film as it gives a twist to the story of escaped convicts by throwing in a religious redemption element in the form of Hunter. But it's a shame we didn't concentrate more on the story of Lukas. At the end you can decide who really wins. Not many are left with their freedom.".

His character Daniel Shore is the only link between two different plot lines set in Marocco and Germany respectively. While there are some surface similarities between the two stories it's hard to figure out what's going on let alone what the actual sequence of events may be. As a result the whole movie has a dreamy semiconscious quality. While that's probably offputting for most viewers I think it's actually an accomplishment. If you consider a certain kind of confusion a valuable experience you will enjoy this. But if you look for straightforward storytelling it will probably feel like a waste of time. Although David Lynch obviously plays in a league of his own Daniel Shore reminded me of Lost Highway in some respects. It's a very promising first feature. I hope this well won't run dry any time soon.".

It seems that the students at Haifa's Golda Meir Junior High School have turned in perfect scores on a Math test and the perplexed teacher and principal of the school are determined to hunt down and punish the cheater. The teacher asks Aren't you guys smart enough to make a few mistakes so we won't catch on that you're cheating? When they find out however that the class did not cheat but were provided answers by a clairvoyant Russian immigrant their authority is shaken.Based on a novel by Pavel Kohout a Czech writer who adapted its story from a screenplay by his wife Jelena Ari Foman and Ori Sivan's Saint Clara is a film of surreal charm that bears comparison to Bunuel and Truffaut. While it is quirky it is not self consciously so and contains characters that we can recognize as real people. Contrary to typical Hollywood fare the film shows psychic abilities such as clairvoyance to be natural attributes of the human mind although in this case according to a family tradition they will last only until the young girl falls in love. The psychic is 13year old Clara Lucy Dubnichek a very quiet girl with deeply expressive eyes. While she is regarded as odd by her punk classmates they are more than happy to receive her help on their examinations and equally eager to enlist her help in planning a revolution that never quite gets off the ground.The oddness in the film is not limited to the students. Mathematics teacher Joseph El Dror had a tour of duty in Vietnam where he claims that he once beat international chess champion Bobby Fischer. The principal Yigal Naor nattily dressed in a red suit claims to have made love to French singing star Edith Piaf. On television we see a weirdly dressed newswoman who constantly speaks about the impending environmental catastrophe and we learn from Rosy that the Richter scale was inspired by Marilyn Monroe. While it has its uneven moments Saint Clara is an offbeat gem that offers with deadpan humor some intriguing insights into adolescent behavior. As Tikel becomes infatuated with Clara the film hints at a more conventional outcome but maintains its irresistible charm and originality until the end.".

The film released in 1996 is set three years in the future in an absurdist industrial cityscape. The school kids talk tough about revolution as they tromp through polluted swamps and through streets lined with huge squares of beehive apartment buildings. The city seems on the very cusp of apocalypse though it's not clear whether the final crisis will arise from a manmade ecological disaster or from the hand of God in the form of an earthquake. Meanwhile the revolution threatens to develop into a new religion with Saint Clara at the center. The entire city listens for her predictions adult men get crushes on her and of course the boys in her class end up fighting over her.To complicate things for Clara her powers may disappear if she falls in love. One of her admirers Tikel has a good chance with her though. He's obsessed with her violet eyes and chicks always fall for thatat least in junior high. I think your visions come from your eyes he tells her.Saint Clara really is about as good as films get. It is a beautiful thing to be able to imagine the nearfuture accelerate the world's problems slightly and then just continue to smile at life. In this way Saint Clara is reminiscent of the irresistibly optimistic films Wim Wenders made during the 1990s. Perhaps the film's best surprise however is the voracious adolescent energy which tints its vision. All the kids in the film are bursting with potential thirsty for life and the adults are sad but charming caricatures thinlyveiled trolls and witches forever dreaming of their lost youth. A naive misconception certainly but here it is also fantastically endearing.Kudos to Kino Video for making this gem available on video.

And the TV in all the houses are tuned to the same show in which a wild haired woman makes cryptic prophecies of doom and destruction.Underneath all of this however is a traditional folk tale of an alienated young boy who falls in love and makes his peace with society. The boy the town and you the viewer learn just how unimportant are things like fame fortune and power. And all along the way you are entertained with tales of magic and humorous anecdotes. Long ago this is the type of tale with which a traveling minstrel would have held your fascination. Remove the postapocalyptic stylizations and this becomes very reminiscent of the early stories of Isaac B.

When you finally see the lesson at the end it just makes the characters seem that much real and the stories that much more entertaining. This is a short and not particularly ambitious movie but it succeeds completely in those things which it does set out to accomplish.".

What I find fascinating about Hedy in her film roles apart from her obvious physical beauty is her genuine Viennese accent her honesty integrity and intelligence and she is every inch the lady.In 2013 I wrote a general amendment to this and other user comments which also applies to those actresses whose films I have already commented on IMDb.com in recent years.My love goddessfilm actresses are Margaret Lockwood Jennifer Jones Vivien Leigh Hedy Lamarr  Ava Gardner.Perhaps you will notice they were all dark brunette 1940s  50s stars.It occurred to me that there should be one defining film which perfectly encapsulates for me their intrinsic personality talent glamour  intellect.These are my choices after years of deliberation Margaret Lockwood  The Wicked Lady 1945 Jennifer Jones  Portrait Of Jennie 1948 Vivien Leigh  That Hamilton Woman 1941 Hedy Lamarr  H.M.Pulman esq 1945 Ava Gardner One Touch of Venus 1948.".

	schema:reviewBody "COME LIVE WITH ME manages to be a charming trifle of a romantic comedy that gives HEDY LAMARR and JAMES STEWART a chance to prove that they may have seemed like an unlikely pair but have sparkling chemistry with each other.Hedy is incredibly beautiful as always as a woman who must find a husband quickly or be deported. On a rainy night she and Stewart meet accidentally in a fast food diner and immediately she decides that this penniless bachelor will have to do. She makes a strictly business proposition with the man a writer down on his luck which he rather readily acceptsand a loveless marriage is negotiated so that she can wed Stewart stay in the country longer and then wed IAN HUNTER who intends to divorce his wife.It's all rather silly and highly improbable. The deepening relationship between Stewart and Lamarr is never really fleshed out so that the viewer can expect to see hints of romance developing. Instead after his story is accepted by a publisher Hunter Stewart decides to whisk Lamarr off to the country to meet his grandmother in a picture perfect rural setting. Naturally love develops quickly and before you know it Ian Hunter is out of the running as Hedy's prospective mate.The most original element in the story has to do with fireflies and Hedy's decision to use a flashlight to attract a mate.It's an unassuming little comedyromance nicely played by the two leads and given good support by ADELINE DeWALT REYNOLDS as the grandma with her platitudes on plaques VERREE TEASDALE as the publisher's open minded wife DONALD MEEK as a park bum and FRANK FAYLEN as a tough talking counterman at a diner.Clarence Brown must be commended for getting a relaxed and assured performance from Lamarr who never looked lovelier. Stewart is his usual earnest self especially good in some comic reaction shots.".

She makes a strictly business proposition with the man a writer down on his luck which he rather readily acceptsand a loveless marriage is negotiated so that she can wed Stewart stay in the country longer and then wed IAN HUNTER who intends to divorce his wife.It's all rather silly and highly improbable. The deepening relationship between Stewart and Lamarr is never really fleshed out so that the viewer can expect to see hints of romance developing. Instead after his story is accepted by a publisher Hunter Stewart decides to whisk Lamarr off to the country to meet his grandmother in a picture perfect rural setting. Naturally love develops quickly and before you know it Ian Hunter is out of the running as Hedy's prospective mate.The most original element in the story has to do with fireflies and Hedy's decision to use a flashlight to attract a mate.It's an unassuming little comedyromance nicely played by the two leads and given good support by ADELINE DeWALT REYNOLDS as the grandma with her platitudes on plaques VERREE TEASDALE as the publisher's open minded wife DONALD MEEK as a park bum and FRANK FAYLEN as a tough talking counterman at a diner.Clarence Brown must be commended for getting a relaxed and assured performance from Lamarr who never looked lovelier. Stewart is his usual earnest self especially good in some comic reaction shots.";

	schema:reviewBody "I was a little bored with the first half hour of this film but a wellwritten turn of events sends this movie in the right direction. It mixes a few classic themes marry vs. deportation country comes to town wealth vs poverty town goes to country etc... that could have made this movie completely formulaic. However formula goes out the door with Jimmy Stewart's charm and Hedy Lamarr's stunning beauty. Once both characters spend screen time together consistently the energy of this slightly screwball romantic comedy picks up quickly. The grandmother is all wisdom wit and heart. Her common sense needlework samplers are artfully placed and still hold true today. The grandmother's calm voice the sound of crickets chirping and the other country nuances slow down the pace to a level that seems so foreign to an actress like Hedy Lamarr. She seems so out of place but that is what makes her so enjoyable to watch. She melts slowly from the WWII city girl ice queen fugitive until she's relaxed and calm as if she can go home again but this time to a slice of Americana rather than Austria and with a moral upstanding young man if that's the choice she's willing to make. This has just been made available for purchase on DVD. It's now on my to buy list and certainly worth a watch on TCM if you enjoy this genre and these wonderfully magnetic actors.".

	schema:reviewBody "Love and marriage are two of the most prevalent topics in our society today. It seems every novel movie and song has something to say about it. When marriage is discussed it is usually followed by the most recent divorce statistic. Virginia Van Upp and Patterson McNutt have written one of the best theories on this subject.Bill Smith James Stewart is an unsuccessful writer who is literally down to his last dime. Johnny Jones played by the gorgeous Hedy Lamarr has just found out some devastating news. She is an illegal immigrant from what used to be Austria. Immigration has finally tracked her down and is giving her a week to find a husband or she will be deported and face certain death. But their lives change for the better one night when Bill and Johnny both enter a little restaurant to get out of the rain. One thing leads to another and Bill gets into a fight. Johnny having witnessed the whole thing comes to his defense and they are both thrown out. She is delighted to hear that he has no money and decides to propose a marriage of convenience. Johnny asks Bill to marry her in exchange for the cost of living. Bill is very much opposed to the idea but in the end she talks him into it with the understanding that when he sells his novel he will pay back everything.Johnny visits Bill once a week to give him the check and Bill begins to write about their situation. Bill falls for Johnny and soon finds out that there is another man in her life. When Bill learns he's sold his manuscript he visits Johnny to sign the divorce papers but under one condition. In my opinion it's perfectly alright for two strangers to get married but you've got to know each other before you get a divorce he says.The title of the movie comes from the first line in Christopher Marlowe's The Passionate Shepherd to His Love. James Stewart is marvelous as the country boy who is willing to fight for what he wants. Hedy Lamarr is excellent as the Viennese refugee trying to make the best life she can for herself. Come Live With Me is more than just another typical romantic comedy. It is intelligent and heartwarming and discusses things like modern marriage reality being stranger than fiction and a happy ending versus a realistic ending.".

This plot element was difficult to reconcile with a romantic filmafter all what's romantic about this relationship? Plus I found it hard to care about such selfish characters. Fortunately I kept watching the film and it turned out to be a dandy old fashioned film.Hedy was in the US illegallyhaving fled Nazicontrolled Austria. So even though she had overstayed her visa it was really hard to blame her for wanting to stay. In an odd bit of casting the immigration agent Barton MacLane liked Hedy and suggested that she could get married to an American and thereby stay in the country. But she couldn't marry Hunter as he was already married. So a bit later when she meets downandout Jimmy Stewart she suggests they get married in name only. Unfortunately over time Jimmy finds himself falling for Hedythough they hardly know each other.I could talk more about the plot but don't want to ruin it. The bottom line is that the writing was excellent the acting superb and the mood wonderful. This is exactly the sort of romance that MGM did best and it's well worth a lookjust don't get turned off by Ian Hunter's characterit does get better.".

	schema:headline " Above Average Comedy of People Finding Each Other";
	schema:reviewBody "This is not the greatest comedy of it's period but it is not one that fails to amuse the audience. In fact parts of it by their sweetness remind one of a better film of the future. But more of that later.COME LIVE WITH ME deals with a man with a modern view of marriage. Mr. Barton Kendrick Ian Hunter is a wealthy in New York whose wife is his chief friend and critic and assistant in the firm. The wife DianeVeree Teasdale goes out at night with a family friend admirer. But that's okay as she allows Barton to likewise enjoy himself. Barton girlfriend is Johnnie Jones Hedy Lamarr and their relationship is fine but soon an immigration officer Barton MacLane playing a rare nice guy role comes to inform her that she has to go to the Immigration Office in New York City because her visa has run out  and she is facing deportation. But MacLane learns from Hunter that Lamarr will be killed if deported back to Austria as her father was an opponent of Hitler and the Nazis who was killed for his opposition. MacLane tells Lamarr to go and find someone to marry within one week and the deportation problem will disappear. Of course MacLane figures that Hunter will be the one to marry her. After MacLane leaves Hunter explains he can't divorce Teasdale in a week to marry Lamarr. So Hedy goes out for a walk to think things through clearly.It is funny to recall that this film was made a year after Mitchell Leisin's film HOLD BACK THE DAWN about immigrants trying to enter our country from Mexico within our impossible post 1924 immigration quotas. Walter Abel unsuccessfully tries to prevent Olivia De Haviland and Charles Boyer from marrying. Ironically the marriage accept ion is not as easy anymore  you have to prove it is a marriage of love and affection and not of convenience now. See the modern Gerald Depardieu comedy GREEN CARD to see the change in the rule.Lamarr in walking past Central Park runs across a man named Bill Smith Jimmy Steward that she thinks is a bum. But she ends up rescuing him from a fight and takes him back to his apartment in lower Manhattan after she hears that he is poor facing bankruptcy and not married. She offers him a marriage arrangement wherein she will marry him but it is only for formality  no sex or closeness involved. He accepts the deal though he insists he will reimburse her when he can sell one of the novels or short stories he writes. As a result of the odd situation Steward starts writing a novel based on it. Interestingly he calls the novel WITHOUT LOVE a title that would one day be that of an MGM film with Tracy and Hepburn having another of convenience. He sends out manuscripts to several publishers and one ends up with Hunter. Teasdale reads it and finds it damn well written even if the plot seems odd. When she describes the plot to Hunter he realizes it is his relationship with Lamarr that is at the basis of the novel. He confronts an unaware Steward at his own office supposedly to discuss publishing the novel. Steward ends up the winner as Teasdale convinces a reluctant Hunter to pay Steward an advance of 500.00. Teasdale also notices that Hunter's protests of the novel's plot are too deep to be sheer literary criticism and realizes that it must be about her husband.Steward uses the money to reimburse Lamarr for her weekly payment of his use as a makeshift husband. Then he forces her politely to accompany him to his country home she wants him to sign the divorce papers and he won't unless she accompanies him and slowly wins her over by the beauties of the countryside and his grandmother's Adeline De Walt Reynolds lovable and strong character. We watch Lamarr gradually note Steward's strong points and even hear him recite Christopher Marlowe's poem Come Live With Me and Be My Bride.... which is the basis of the film. But Hunter is aware of where they have gone and is after them. Will Hedy stick with Ian or go with Jimmy.The film is certainly quite charming but what I find most interesting at the end is the business of the Grandmother. The visit of Steward with Lamarr to meet the grandmother in the countryside and her firm but gentle personality resembles that of Catherine Nesbit as Cary Grant's grandmother in the film AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER. One wonders if Leo McCarey had seen this Clarence Brown film and remembered it in 1955. It would not be impossible if that was the case. But if so or not COME LIVE WITH ME is good enough to be liked on it's own merits as an entertaining movie.".

Lamarr is Johannes Johnny Jones a showgirl who has immigrated from what was Austria however her visa has run out. Her boyfriend publisher Barton Kendrick Ian Hunter has an open arrangement with his wife Veree Teasdale he also has connections but immigration shows up too soon. The immigration officer takes pity on Johnny and gives her one week to get married so she can stay in the country. He assumes wrongly that she is going to marry Kendrick. Obviously she can't but then she meets a down and out writer Bill Smith Stewart and talks him into marrying her. She agrees to pay him 17 a week which equals his living expenses.Come Live with Me is not a riproaring screwball comedy but a nice romantic one with some fine performances from Lamarr Stewart Hunter Teasdale Donald Meek and Adeline De Walt Reymolds as Bill's grandmother. De Walt Reynolds had only begun her acting career the year before in 1940 at the age of 78. She lived to be 98 and worked mostly on television until she died. She's excellent here.Stewart and Lamarr do well together. Worth seeing  no blockbuster but it will leave you with a smile on your face.".

She agrees to pay him 17 a week which equals his living expenses.Come Live with Me is not a riproaring screwball comedy but a nice romantic one with some fine performances from Lamarr Stewart Hunter Teasdale Donald Meek and Adeline De Walt Reymolds as Bill's grandmother. De Walt Reynolds had only begun her acting career the year before in 1940 at the age of 78. She lived to be 98 and worked mostly on television until she died. She's excellent here.Stewart and Lamarr do well together. Worth seeing  no blockbuster but it will leave you with a smile on your face.";

	schema:headline " Light comedy romance set in late 1930s";
	schema:reviewBody "Come Live with Me was being made as World War II was underway in Europe. Hedy Lamarr nee Hedwig Eva Kiesler had left her native Austria and first husband for Paris in 1937. She was hired by MGM and moved to America where she made her first American film Algiers in 1938. The U.S. was not yet in the war yet war headlines filled the newspapers in January 1941 when Come Live with Me appeared in theaters. But with no mention of the war at all in the film it's probably set in the late 1930s before Germany started its offensives. No doubt many moviegoers were intrigued by the film's theme as well as enjoying seeing James Stewart and Lamarr who had fast become a star. Lamarr is Johnny Jones a foreign citizen with money who wants to stay in the U.S. after her visa has expired. She is the love interest of a married wealthy American publisher Barton Kendrick played by Ian Hunter. She wants to find a husband as a way to become a citizen. She runs into Bill Smith played by Stewart who is an outofwork down on his luck writer. So she proposes a marriage of convenience between Smith and Jones. She provides funds for his bare necessities  17.80 per week if he will marry her and that will keep him while he resumes his writing. Of course he plans to pay every penny of that back when he strikes it rich. The two don't live together. A love triangle is part of the story because Jones has been the love interest of a married man for the past year. Barton Kendrick played by Ian Hunter is a wealthy publisher. His wife Diana played by Verree Teasdale reads the manuscript of a story Smith has written and sent to Kendrick publishing. It's a story about an out of work American who meets an Austrian immigrant who wants to stay in America One can guess where the story goes from there and the best funny stuff in the film happens toward the end. It's an OK film that's mostly a light comedy romance. The plot is skimpy and the dialog has just occasional lines of humor here and there. A better screenplay could have made this a very good comedy. And the way the characters play their roles  especially Lamarr it's hard to believe the romance. It just comes on at the last minutes in the film. This film is far down on the list of Stewart movies but it's about in the middle of Lamarr's. Even though she was for some time labeled the most beautiful woman in the world and she had some talent Lamarr's films mostly were forgettable. Her two best films with memorable roles were Algiers of 1938 and Comrade X of 1940. She was offered better stuff in her early career but turned down the female leads in two films that are classics  Gaslight 1940 English production and Casablanca of 1942. Still this is a film that most people should enjoy Lamarr quit acting after 1958. She was just 44 years old and on her fifth marriage. It was her longest that she thought might last. She was unlucky in love and married and divorced one more time. Her last marriage ended in 1964. She had two children with second husband John Loder 194347 and she had one adopted daughter. She died alone in her home in Casselberry Florida at age 85 in 2000. Lamarr may be the only screen actor to be in the National Inventors Hall of Fame. She was inducted in 2014 along with former Hollywood composer George Antheil. At the start of World War II the two invented a frequency hopping technique that could be used by the Allies to prevent jamming of torpedo guidance systems. Apparently it wasn't used by the U.S. until 1962 but later became an important aspect for wireless communications. The inventors received no compensation for their discovery. The original 1942 patent expired and the technique became part of the public domain. Here are some of my favorite lines from the film. For a few more comedy lines see the Quotes section under this IMDb Web page of the movie. Jimmy Stewart recites the first and last stanzas of Christopher Marlowe's poem Come live with me and be my love. Bill My name's Smith. Johnny My name's Jones. Taxi driver Let's see  Smith and Jones and I'm Snow White.Johnny Mr. Smith it's such a wonderful thing. Bill Why? Johnny That you haven't any money. Taxi driver And I thought I'd heard everything. Bill as he and Johnny enter his apartment It's just a little place but its dreary. Pointing out his empty book case If you want to browse among my books the pawnshop's just around the corner. Bill Would you like to have some music? I could open the window and get the radio from across the street. Johnny I came here to ask you to marry me. Bill Why? Johnny Because you have no money. Bill looking befuddled Well this is so sudden. Johnny I was afraid you wouldn't understand. Bill Yeah yeah well I see your point.".

They certainly could have made her romance James Stewart more during the week she had before facing being removed. Instead she merely weds Stewart quickly. After they're wed her lover then decides to divorce his wife so that he can be free to marry her. Why in heaven's name didn't he do this before her marriage to Stewart.Going up to grandma's house at the end of this film does nothing either. Grandma's house is full of proverbs.

	schema:reviewBody "A nice romantic comedy about a marriage of convenience between Hedy Lamarr and Jimmy Stewart where an illegal Austrian woman is subject to deportation and looks for a US citizen to marry to avoid being deported. A very good supporting cast helps to carry the movie throughout the plot. The weak points in the movie is how a woman would go to a near perfect stranger's apartment to discuss the marriage proposal and how she could have allowed herself to be forced to accompany her husband of convenience to his family farm for a visit. I think the film needed a bit of more development between the two characters as they were falling in love. The ending seemed a bit too rushed. The woman's original lover just driving away that quickly after she decided to stay with her husband did not seem plausible given the relationship that the former lovers had at the beginning of the movie. It was still a nice script with fine performances.".

Herbert Stothart's use of the Lone Ranger Theme as Kendrick's leitmotif is a stroke of genius thanks to Rossini the photography George Folsey is glorious the art direction Randall Duell impeccable and the film editing Frank E. Hull brisk. Everything seems to be going well but then the movie suddenly grinds to a halt. The story is all used up. So the screenwriter attempts to bolster up Van Upp's thin original story by introducing some cameo characters. The most successful of these inserts are Donald Meek's professional bum and Miss Adeline de Walt Reynolds' crusty but philosophical grandma. Despite these praiseworthy attempts to give customers a run for their admittance money however the movie is never ever more than moderately entertaining. But I think the worst ploy of all however are the sexless outfits that costume designer Adrian dreamed up for Hedy Lamarr. Didn't Hedy say in an interview once that Adrian was jealous of her in with studio boss Louis B. Mayer and deliberately set out to scuttle her career?".

It's clear she hasn't thought romantically one whit about Bill or for that matter even friendship thoughts. It's been entirely a business transaction for her. All the while she's been having a happy fun loving relationship with Barton for months. And then in one 12 day stretch she somehow through the magic a bad writing falls for Bill and totally ditches the guy she's been longing to marry for the last several months. Barton is never played as bad. it's not like he ever neglected Johnny or strung her along with false promises or was mean to her or anything else that might lead us to believe she'd dump him so quickly. He's been loving to her the entire time we've seen them together and she to him. All we can gather is that she'll dump Bill just as easily for the next guy.".

It's actually a rather pedestrian affair with few genuinely funny moments and way too many sappy ones.Plot in a nutshell A Viennese refugee Hedy Lamarr proposes a marriage of convenience to an unemployed destitute writer James Stewart.The best part of the film finds Stewart's character visiting a book publisher to discuss his manuscript. Neither of them know....yet....that said manuscript actually details the film's plot and they are both players in it. Funny funny stuff. But sadly the rest of the film doesn't come close to matching it. Hedy Lamarr's beauty is the only other item here deserving mention. Stewart's character was rather whiny and annoying major disappointment.I found a contemporary newspaper review from 1941 and the author of the piece listed only as T.S. was similarly unimpressed with this film. Those comments are belowDirector Clarence Brown is accenting the heartthrob again in a sentimental little lark called Come Live With Me now at the Capitol. The script has been neatly devised by Patterson McNutt it has been directed with great camera skill by Mr. Brown James Stewart is in it and he is an engaging actor Hedy Lamarr is present too and she is darkly beautiful at least. Surely these would seem sufficient enticements and yet for all the superior craft in it Come Live With Me lacks sparkle and spontaneity. It is too stiff in the joints for a madcap antic its sentiment is oversoft. Perhaps the fault lies in the fact that both author and director have tried to weave some homely emotion and philosophy in a story which is adequate enough for farce but much too artificial for more pretentious treatment.Briefly it is the account of a lady refugee much in love with an already married publisher who evades deportation by marrying a footloose young man who writes books. But even a businesslike arrangement has its romantic pitfalls. The author falls in love with the lady wafts her off to a bucolic retreat and there amid the samplercovered walls the crickets and the fireflies the said lady finally succumbs. Those fireflies! In them Mr. Brown has found one of the neatest tricks of the year for evading andor undermining the Hays office. The coquette of the insect species it seems winks a light every two seconds when in a romantic swoon. Miss Lamarr uses a flashlight. For the rest the director is as consistently inventive in using the camera to carry the narrative although he has failed to pace the film beyond a dogtrot. Even Mr. Stewart for all his usual charm seems listless and Miss Lamarr is more decorative than talented as a comedienne. Despite all the alluring promise of the invitation in Come Live With Me its pleasures prove to be quite ordinary after all.Couldn't have said it better myself. 610. Times watched 1. Watch again?

Dwayne Johnson and Channing Tatum both bring a certain likability to their characters and I enjoyed watching them the most and of course Adrianne Palicki who was very friendly on the eyes.Overall The film might not have much of a plot but the great visuals and the well made action sequences keep it from becoming a total bore.

The film definitely had some amazingly entertaining action sequences and awesome special effects but you know you can't really be THAT amazed with an action film. Not gonna lie the screenplay in this film was pretty well written and it included quite a few pleasantly surprising laughs. Dwayne Johnson has a big few months ahead of him with the release of Snitch which I give a 710 the next Fast and Furious movie and Pain  Gain. With this film he did reinforce his true acting credentials even though not much notable acting is observed in such a genre.

The guy just like appeared out of no whereCharacter wise Cobra rules compared to the Joes. Lady Jaye and Flint were not really that interesting to watch and the romance between them didn't really look that convincing. Killing off Duke Hauser Channing Tatumand letting Roadblock The Rock take over as team leader for me was the biggest letdown in my opinion since he never really looked that great playing the lead role. Bruce Willis was OK a Joe but nothing exciting but for me the best Joe out there would have to be Snake Eyes Ray Park. His performances were great as usual and really made the movie looked excitingAs for the villains I really wanted to see Zartan fight with somebody but that didn't happen. Destro was the biggest disappointment for me since they killed his character off just like that. Cobra Commander looked better in this outfit that the previous one but there was really nothing from him but in my opinion the best villain and character of the entire movie has got to go to Firefly Ray Stevenson His character was so wicked cool and I really loved how those nano flys were used as his explosion device. Though a villain he stood out the most in the film for me I can't say much for the rest of the cast like Storm Shadow and Jinx since there wasn't really anything much from themHowever I find it kind of hard to believe that this is a G.I Joe movie since apart from Snake Eyes there wasn't really anything that made me feel that these guys were the G.I Joes since it felt like there were very little connection between this team to the previous G.I Joe team in the first movieOverall a bit of a letdown compared to the first movie and it didn't seemed like it was a sequel to the first G.I Joe movie and it wasn't really worth watching it in 3D either".

One such picture  I'm sorry  movie that audiences will endure a release of either glorifyingly or harshly is G.I. Joe Retaliation the new brawn packed action farce from Paramount Pictures.Starring Dwayne The Rock Johnson and with appearances by Bruce Willis and Channing Tatum the film offers no social commentary consists of nothing remotely engaging I tended to doze off on even the action scenes and pities itself with egregious CGI 3D effects that disappear midair depending on where one sits in the audience. There is no basis for being an audience member because the effects are so jarring that the viewer will not be able to involve itself to anything worth sitting for an hour and forty minutes for which trust me there wouldn't be anyway. But that's not the half of the film's problems.The real problem stems from lack of plot. More like no plot. The film is supposed to be a sequel or rather a continuation of the original G.I. Joe Rise of the Cobra but even by todays standards the filmmakers weren't trying to mark any new ground. All we get is one action sequence after another. Even James Cameron knows you need a throughline of plot device to make these kinds of movies work but director Jon M. Chu doesn't have enough respect for the audience to even give them that. Instead we are mindlessly treated to fast shots of punches being thrown with no idea who is throwing them why or if we should care. Seriously. We only know one thing. The good guys will always win. Never a good sign when you go to the movies to know how they end with no conscious minding of what it will take to get there. Don't waste your money my friends. Still more muscular contractions ache this bastard of a performer.Those involved knew this was just a paycheck  examine the evidence Dennis Quaid did not return and subsequently they need Bruce Willis to carry the big name legacy. Channing Tatum has his screen time terminally reduced not a great sign because most audiences will probably be wanting to see the film solely for his performance. The writer was clearly hired to write a howto on perfecting scripts for CGI based stories. This wouldn't be such an insult to film purists and enthusiasts alike if it wasn't such a dreary waste of time and money. There is nothing there in terms of story or structure. The movie starts and it's action scenes strung together with no link. Then you leave. I would disclose such a plot to entice what viewers may challenge the notion of wasting their money if such a plot existed! It's a disgusting practice of showoff acrobatics by computer geniuses that would be better suited decrypting or ciphering codes left behind from the Zodiac Killer or the Unabomber! This is not why we go to the movies. We go to be entertained and I predict that many an audience member be robbed of their hard earned cash in this recession and by such standards and caused an equal recession in film quality! Honestly there has to be a better place for films in today being tomorrow's history than this!An early release for such a seemingly summer blockbuster  it's obvious Paramount wants to get this one out of the way so they don't have to worry about a summer release tanking to the bottom of the swimming pool a place where the preteens normally disposed to this mendicant tar would be better off spending the day. It's futile to promote a product without any real integrity or so I thought. Amazing what a little muscle can do. It's already seen some couple million smackers across the face! for it's previews and advance releases but when it all comes down G.I. Joe Retaliation is one hunk of movie that holds a strong PR campaign in it's biceps but can't think for itself and never latches on to the timeless fact that the real strength of a movie lies in it's story and it's characters both factors of the machine that are simultaneously weak.".

	schema:reviewBody "G.I. Joe Rise of Cobra feels like it belongs to a different age of blockbusters. It had a hard time fitting in to the modern generation thus most moviegoers never find it as appealing as the other films that was released on that year. Those rants can be true only in some reasons. The film is undeniably silly and dumb but it was never boring and has its own quality. Since people are now asking for darker and much serious blockbusters this sequel reduces all the silliness that was displayed on the original. G.I. Joe Retaliation is cooler and less cartoony. Unfortunately it is also less exciting and terribly uninspired. The action may be better looking but the lack of fortitude and creativity made it fall short into another visual showcase stress.Awesome is the main goal of this sequel. While the original was too corny to impress this film darkens the tone and made it a bit down to earth. It abandons the silly gadgets and the ridiculous laws of physics that was shown in the original. But the film fails to be both dark and realistic. Not only because of those robotic fireflies and the mass annihilating missiles but the secret prisons and the government are unbelievably dumb to manage their job. Well it's a blockbuster based on toys so it will never be too realistic. Deal with it while we are here for the fun. The dark aspects aren't dark at all. What they only do is to be serious. This seriousness blocks the potential joy and turns it into standard blockbuster bland.The storytelling is quite messy. It's like an uninteresting version of Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol with uninteresting characters. The storytelling from the first movie wasn't great either since it is cluttered with cheesy flashbacks. But it's worse here because it takes some twists that are absurdly incoherent. And so it's all pretentious. The characters are boring and even the performances can't bring them to life. Dwayne Johnson is the only good thing among them though Bruce Willis is trying to make fun of himself again as a crazy grandaddy and the villains ham it up which isn't suppose to be a bad thing but they can't give enough personality to them.The action scenes are acceptable enough to call awesome at least. With all the explosions and the none CGIed machines it seems to be really exciting but it's not. It does a fine job to be pretty but there's a difference between good looking and exciting. There's only a little suspense. If there is actually suspense and joy then it would be found at the mountain ninja fight but it's just mild and still glosses some slow motions in it. For the rest of the action the heroes are always superior. Plus more explosions and slowmos. The action is stylishly directed anyway. The fight between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow remains to be the only action that excites and one part of the climax has a nutty scene with The Rock riding huge vehicles and shooting like a badass. The production designs special effects and costumes gets better. What else to talk about it?The absence of the Joes' ridiculous transportation and weapons holograms and other snazzy gadgets may please our modern viewers but it also forgets why this material is interesting anyway. Now we only get typical military stuff. It still has some crazy devices but it's limited compare to the first film. Rise of Cobra wasn't a classic. It's nothing more than a simple guilty pleasure. Same with Retaliation except this one can't even be completely pleasurable unless you want some endless visual coolness. Cool is not a bad thing but it could have been creative and much more exciting instead of showing off slowmos on screen. To be fair it's mildly entertaining and good to look at. If the film wasn't this visually awesome it would have been an empty cinema. The series still fails to justify its source material.".

	onyx:emotionText "G.I. Joe Rise of Cobra feels like it belongs to a different age of blockbusters. It had a hard time fitting in to the modern generation thus most moviegoers never find it as appealing as the other films that was released on that year. Those rants can be true only in some reasons. The film is undeniably silly and dumb but it was never boring and has its own quality. Since people are now asking for darker and much serious blockbusters this sequel reduces all the silliness that was displayed on the original. G.I. Joe Retaliation is cooler and less cartoony. Unfortunately it is also less exciting and terribly uninspired. The action may be better looking but the lack of fortitude and creativity made it fall short into another visual showcase stress.Awesome is the main goal of this sequel. While the original was too corny to impress this film darkens the tone and made it a bit down to earth. It abandons the silly gadgets and the ridiculous laws of physics that was shown in the original. But the film fails to be both dark and realistic. Not only because of those robotic fireflies and the mass annihilating missiles but the secret prisons and the government are unbelievably dumb to manage their job. Well it's a blockbuster based on toys so it will never be too realistic. Deal with it while we are here for the fun. The dark aspects aren't dark at all. What they only do is to be serious. This seriousness blocks the potential joy and turns it into standard blockbuster bland.The storytelling is quite messy. It's like an uninteresting version of Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol with uninteresting characters. The storytelling from the first movie wasn't great either since it is cluttered with cheesy flashbacks. But it's worse here because it takes some twists that are absurdly incoherent. And so it's all pretentious. The characters are boring and even the performances can't bring them to life. Dwayne Johnson is the only good thing among them though Bruce Willis is trying to make fun of himself again as a crazy grandaddy and the villains ham it up which isn't suppose to be a bad thing but they can't give enough personality to them.The action scenes are acceptable enough to call awesome at least.

	schema:reviewBody "I'll start off by saying that I really enjoyed this movie. At times it made me laugh at times it gave me frights there were many times when it set my pulse racing. It's an action movie its supposed to. Not once did it make me think of how flawed western civilization really is or put tears in my eyes or make me appreciate living in a 21st century western country with plenty to eat drink etc. Its an action movie it's NOT supposed to. And thats where I find some of these reviews annoying. If you go to the cinema to see a movie called GI Joe Retaliation which is an action movie you should only rate it accordingly. This movie easily fulfills all the criteria for a good action film so if you want to go see an action movie then yes go see this. The acting isn't bad the plot is fairly good and the visuals are incredible. But if you want to see a realistic film one that will make you smile sob or think about life do not go see this film. What this film is is 2 hours entertainment. It will have you glued to the screen for that 2 hours especially if you see it in 3D. I would recommend GI Joe Retaliation to anyone from about the age of ten up as long as you walk into the cinema or press play expecting to see a good action movie. If you do this you will be thoroughly entertained for 2 hours. Enjoy!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the last time I sit in the middle of the row. Had I been sitting on the aisle I would have left long before the movie was over.Maybe if I were in the 13 to 24 age bracket and had grown up playing video games...Or maybe if I were still a little boy at heart and still played video games...One reviewer lauded the jaw dropping visual fx. Really? Was this person exaggerating or just haven't been to the movies in about 20 years? Nothing new here. Same visual fx you'll see in any 200 million movie or a video game.The bottom line is this movie is just like a big long expensive video game. If you like that then go see it. Except don't be disappointed if they don't let you have the controller.Don't get me wrong I think it's totally cool when a bad guy can get run over by and Escaladeafter having beaten up The Rock for crying out loud and get right back up and run away. It's also kind of cool that he can get on a motorcycle start it put it in gear AND ride safely away in less time than it takes for said Escalade to hit a dumpster. Also it was interesting that Duke had the time to yell Incoming get Flint out of the way yet he sits there and takes it like a man. I guess Tatum wanted out of his contract. Maybe he saw this going the same way as Police Academy 15.I'm not sure why I expect so much from a movie based on a toy. My only question is where will they go next? They have GI Joe Battle Ship Transformers Rock'em Sock'em RobotsReal Steel... what's next? Toss Across? Battling Tops? Maybe they'll make a scifi flick about silly putty. I wonder if producers read these things to get ideasAnd the dialog was pretty bad. I was trying to remember one particular line that was really bad but I guess it was so disgusting that it ran screaming out of my memory. RZA was the absolute worst part of the whole thing. The Rat in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was a better actor than RZA. Where's Master Po when you need him? I'm not sure why anyone thinks Rappers make good actors. Anyway lots of action some way hot chicks who kick but always cool IMO AND there will probably be another sequel.If all that sounds like it's worth 10 bucks to you then have at it. I wait until movies come to the 2 theater and sometimes they aren't even worth that much.".

	schema:reviewBody "After 2009 surprisingly well done Rise of Cobra I was expecting an entertain sequel anticipating how the writers and director would tie in Zartan as President. It seems the studio decided to reboot the franchise by decided to continue parts of the previous storyline which fails horribly. The movie ends up being a mashed up thrown together movie with little continuation of the previous storyline and muscular actors whose roles are just being muscular people with guns. The movies basic premise is around nuclear disarmament. With the GI Joe's forced to rebuild and discover the plan of Cobra before they destroy the world.The only good part of the movie is the opening where The Rock and Channing Tatum display the only enjoyable on screen chemistry of any of the actors. Unfortunately that chemistry is blown up roughly 15 minutes in when Tatum's character is blown up. When Tatum is killed The Rock's character is upset for about two minutes. Stranded in a desert The Rock Lady Jaye and Flint somehow manage to make it back to America. Though how is unknown. To avoid being found the trio hide in an abandon rec centre where they find weights and old computers from over a decade ago. Yet 5 minutes later is all upgraded to state of the art technology in which lady Jaye is able to find videos of the present discover his commonly used phrases and hand position before and after Zartan has become President. Yes all this on 1995 technology that magically upgrades and takes her a matter of hours. Now the side plot which is equally as awful. Stormshadow who appeared to be dead at the end of the first movie somehow is alive. Stormshadow breaks Cobra commander out of prison leaving destro. But is badly burn during his escape. To recover from his burns Stormshadow travels to the mountains where he is revived. SnakeEyes and his protg climb the mountain drug Stormshadow to return him to the place of their training as seen in the first movie. As in the first movie they are trying Stormshadow for murdering the master. Stormshadow then proves to the council he is not guilty as it was not his sword. Back video shows it was Zartan in disgust. Stormshadow joins the Joes in fight against Cobra. Need I say more the plot is illogical leaving anyone who saw the first movie scratching their heads. Flint and Lady Jaye prove to be nothing more than eye candy for the viewer as they have very little back story and don't advance the previous story. The films ending action sequence is rushed and poorly planned out. The scene boils down to the Joes showing up little planning and no story on where the building is there are attacking. Yet kill everyone but Cobra commander and save the day.".

It had a great script great soundtrack fantastic action and great visuals. This is a must for action fans!";

The bad not that the leads are great actors but back to back to back action set pieces leave little room for acting the dialogs are as banal as they can get and the climax is cartoonishly over the top.Retaliation takes off from where Rise of Cobra ended and the movie is best enjoyed by folks versed in the Joes legend  the President of the US has been replaced by Zartan aided with some cool nanomite wizardry. The timeline is a mix of alternate and real history Pakistan is a failed state and the Joes are sent to retrieve the country's nuclear arsenal. But it is a trap the President is after all a Cobra operative and he wipes out the entire GI Joe force including the hero from the previous film Duke Channing Tatum except for the intrepid trio of Roadblock The Rock Dwayne Johnson  Lady Jaye Adrianne Palicki and Flint D J Cotrona. It is up to these three along with the original Joe Bruce Willis to expose the fraud president and prevent global annihilation.GI Joe action figures gained popularity in the mid 80s when the world was falling at the feet of Japan economic hatchbacks Walkman ninjas VCR et allaction movies in the 80s paid homage to Japan anyone remember Robocop 3?. The Japanese angle in GI Joe is Snake Eyes Jinx and Storm Shadow together they deliver one of the finest one on one sword fight in a monastery and then director Jon Chu goes one step better to give your ticket worth price 3D action sequence in snow capped Himalayan territory when Snake Eyes and Jinyx escape from a platoon of ninjas whooshing between peaks rappelling sheer cliffs braving avalanches gunfire and swords. The trailer features some of this out of the word stuntwork but the full experience of this in the movie is amazing so much so that after this the other Joes do not matter anymore its Snake Eyes that your eyes will follow and i think it is about time he got his solo movie he is cool enough! I was happy to see Dwayne Johnson return to his roots the Rock always adds class to any role he takes on he has his family audience fans but he is first and foremost an action star with a sweet core. Jonathan Pryce as the President is delightfully funny as a villain reveling in his new found power and Bruce Willis totes his own brand of hairless machismo. This is Hasbro's third live adaption of its action figurestoys after Transformers and Battleships. So if you are above 12 it will feel ridiculous funny and overblown. Characters do not have names just tags. Things get blown up big and there is a villain thirsting for world dominion. This is not mature and contemplative graphic novel adaptation this is the cinematic equivalent of a Big Mac meal the ultimate junk food and like the Mac meal it gives the kick and leaves a sweet feeling too . I grew up on comic books and action figures and perhaps the greatest kick I get out of these kind of movies is the magical transport back to childhood. For guts and for glory for guns and for action for setting the summer of 2013 on fire  710. Booyaah!".

Luckily they kept Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow they are just as awesome as they were in the previous film really enjoy the rival show of these two character.The story line is average the plot is weird doesn't have ups and downs only a parallel line from beginning to the end. There is no climax in G.I Joe Retaliation but if you say the movie is excited at all time it would be hard to argue.There are not much advanced and cool weapon stuffs in this sequel probably to fit the story I'd say it is actually kinda boring compare to the previous G.I.

	schema:reviewBody "I was absolutely disgusted with this film. It wasn't particularly offensive to any particular group although the film's depiction of Muslims in one scene and the fact that every Asian character in the movie is a Ninja will likely raise a few eyebrows so much as it was to its audience. The film expects the audience to believe outlandish scenes so long as there are explosions. The film is shortalthough it feels long but even with the film's length about 12 of the scenes are utterly pointless. The opening scene involves some event in a North Korean factory...that event is never mentioned again.The acting in this film was dreadful. Every actor appears to be sleeping their way through the film waiting for their next paycheck. I've seen better acting in Super Bowl advertisements than I have in this film. Granted none of these actors are particularly talented in the first place but this movie makes them look even worse than before. It is also painful to watch Bruce Willis lose another shred of his dignity which is now lesser than his hair.Even the special effects were subpar. There are a few decent explosions but one scene in particular involving ninjas on a mountain top looks more like a video game than a feature film. The problem with the action scenes in this movie is that we don't care about the characters they're all identical in terms of personality. If I don't care about your character I don't care if your character lives or dies or how your character lives or dies. And if the actors don't even care I certainly don't care.Overall if you want a popcorn flick you can find something far better than this.".

	schema:reviewBody "Call me JOEAs a kid I was a huge fan of the GI Joe cartoons and had a vast collection of the action figures but I never thought it was a very good idea to bring the franchise to the big screen. I didn't like the first film despite all the great special effects because the entire concept was just way too silly and I didn't like this film all that much either despite the fact it had a better story and some more interesting characters. What really saved this film for me was a ten minute action scene in the mountains which was pretty amazing and made the entire movie worthwhile. It was one of the best action scenes I've seen all year. This second film was directed by Jon M. Chu Justin Bieber Never Say Never and Step Up 2 and the screenplay cowritten by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick Zombieland but very few actors are back from the original movie only five so this felt like a totally different movie. Retaliation is much better than Rise of Cobra but it still felt a little light due to the nonstop action. It's one of those movies you can enjoy for two hours but forget about once it's over. What it does have going for it is that is includes better action stars like The Rock and Bruce Willis. The Rock is probably one of the best contemporary action stars and he already brought the Fast and Furious franchise back alive again. He doesn't quite do the same with GI Joe but he still makes this movie a little more enjoyable than the original one. Despite all the cheesiness of the plot I still had some fun and the producers knew that the premise couldn't be taken seriously so they just played around with it.The Joes continue to serve and protect the world under the leadership of Captain Duke Channing Tatum and his team which consists of Roadblock Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock Flint D.J. Cotrona and Jaye Adrianne Palicki. They have a couple of successful missions until the team is betrayed by the US president Jonathan Pryce who is actually Zartan Arnold Vosloo infiltrated as him. Thus the Joes are forced to fight enemy forces inside their own government and are forced to receive help from the only person they can trust retired General Joe Colton Bruce Willis. Meanwhile Storm Shadow Byunghun Lee has conceived a plan with Firefly Ray Stevenson to free their imprisoned Cobra Commander Luke Bracey. Snake Eyes Ray Park is determined to stop him with the help of Jinx Elodie Yung but the Joes are running out of time with the President threatening the world with a nuclear war. Will the Joes be able to stop the Cobra team before they destroy the entire world?Channing Tatum and The Rock shared some funny scenes together and had great chemistry but I would have enjoyed more screen time with them. Adrianne Palicki looked great in that red dress and was a good addition to the film. Cotrona and Willis didn't do much but the highlight of the film was the mountain action sequence between Park and Lee. The film had its extremely cheesy moments and I couldn't believe they even didn't care about the explosion of London. They continued as if nothing ever happened and celebrated the success of the mission without considering the devastating loss. I think that was probably the worst part of the film and the entire scene was probably used to attract people through the trailers. Retaliation is big and loud anticipation for what is to come in the blockbuster summer movies. By the time summer gets here we will probably have forgotten all about this movie but it was still a fun and entertaining two hours. Even those people that will end up hating this film will have to agree that the ten minute action scene between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow was pretty entertaining. As long as you don't think too much about what's going on you might enjoy this senseless film.".

What is it about this that makes it bad storytelling and bad cinema?I heavily criticize the Marvel movies. But that is because they are poor cinema generally the storytelling is crackerjack. I think Tarantino is usually worthless but I do credit him with knowing how to put together a cinematic story.Why this film is uncinematic is an easy shot. Clearly what they did was divide up the film and budget and send the parts out to centers all over the world. That means that it has no soul. One moment you'll be swinging with cartoon ninjas in the Himalayas in three D effects clearly added afterwards and then the fight goes through a window and an amateur crew shoots two huffy guys rolling in the snow. We are jerked from a writerdirector stance of a buddy movie to cheap explosions to more than one poor imitations of comicdom. It lacks coherence so it lacks soul.One would almost think it was intended. If the idea is to sell dolls so that juvenile testosterone surges can be monetized then perhaps there is some wisdom in erasing the humanity from the thing so that kids can pour themselves in more readily. But no. As was once said of a past US president the stupidity is not a sly act.You can see some of the difficulties they faced. Because they are selling dolls they have to interrupt the situation at hand to give characterdefining backstory so you have built in fragmentation. They have to live with the legacy dolls I suppose. Marvel has a similar problem with The Avengers which they solved by having each major character have his own introductory movies.The fascinating part for me is the shuffling of two worlds. One world is the gutsy army guy with big guns. He has no superpower and it is all about the guns and the mania. This world is elaborated by having an eternal enemy army and a group of special forces types including a woman. The stereotypes draw from war movies and there is a sort of beauty in closing the loop from movie concepts to toy play to movie about the play.But there is also the ninja world wholly separate in concept and with an origin in a different film genre. Here ninja magic is routine and derived from a magical jewel. Something like superpowers are assumed. The skill in battle comes not from being bold but from long training with masters. Previous comics and cartoons provide extensive backstory of the Arashikage Clan the good guys and the characters we see here. There is I read a thorough weaving of the two worlds in the backstories some soldiers join the clan and the clan evolves to support the GI Joes. But the problem is not that someone hasn't 'explained' the connection but that they really do live in worlds with different physics. One is a world of bravado and bullets while the other is a matter of stealth and skill. Battle devotion honor comrades all have different nonoverlapping meanings.

The direction by Kathryn Bigelow is nothing short of excellent. Her handling of the action and suspense scenes is exciting and riveting. The two skydiving scenes are brilliant as is the foot chase through the streets and houses of the city. The script by W. Peter Illif is also very good and the best thing about the film. The plot is multilayered and has an original relationship between the hero and the villain. The way the story resolves itself and the ultimate resolutions is excellent by the standards of most Hollywood action films.This film deserves to be remembered as one of the better actioners of the nineties not up there with Die Hard 23 or Speed but better than 90 of the action junk made nowadays.

They are led by Bodhi Patrick Swayze and have a big addiction for thievery. Johnny then however falls in love with a female surfer Tyler Lori Petty and she happens to be connected to the surfing bank robbers. So now Tyler must decide to either stay good and stop the bad guys or join the dark side and become one of them.The plot was fine and ran in a pretty moderate pace. What really helped the film was the acting and the action  surfing scenes. Reeves and Swayze worked really good together and Gary Busey is also in this as Reeve's partner. The whole cast for the most part did a great job.The action worked pretty well and I loved the surfing elements in the movie. They were all shot very wel and made the film feel more intriguing.Bottom line Point Break is a classic and has one of Swayze's best roles that he could do.".

	schema:headline " SwayzeReeves best action movie one of my personal favorite 90's action films of all time";
	schema:reviewBody "To me one of the best action movies of the 90's. Point Break is a 1991 action heist 100 percent pure adrenaline rush movie. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow and stars Patrick Swayze Keanu Reeves and Gary Busey. This review is only dediceted to Point Break fans and no one else. If you love the movie come read my review I am also reviewing this movie on YouTube I am going to defend it. I Love this film to death I have a history with this film. This is going to be one of my hardest reviews I have done before. I would say the movie halped me get trough tough times in the year 2005. I am also going to defend this movie and Keanu Reeves character Johnny Utah.The movie made me in to Keanu Reeves fan I am today. Point Break is my number 1 favorite Keanu Reeves movie. Top five his best movies would be Point Break John Wick The Matrix Speed and Constantine. The Year 2005 my year become one of my worst years I drop out sophmore year in secondary school quit my job I had health problems with my weight. My mom was rushed middle of the night in the hospital. I went end of school year with this group on a tour visiting Poland for 10 days when I come back my father was rushed in to hospital he had a surgery. By the time he was in hospital I found out this movie Point Break 1991 on VHS tape when I taped it long time ago and I kept watching it and I was entertained. And after many times watching it I become a huge fan of Keanu Reeves and Point Break become my favorite action movie of all time. Die Hard 1988 Die Hard With a Vengeance The Last Boy Scout Point Break and Hard Target movies really helped me get trough hard times. Bill  Ted's Bogus Journey sucks! I hate that movie! I try many times to get it but I couldn't I hate it. Point Break is MILES way better than Bill  Ted's Bogus Journey that Keanu Reeves did!There was a remake of Point Break in 2015 and it sucks donkey ass! Remake is garbage with CGI and a lot of green color Picture. It can't come near this movie!The story is about a bank robbery crew name as the ExPresidents robbering banks during summer time. They robbed 27 banks so far in three years they end in up 60 seconds no one gets shoot. So far they were never caught. Johnny Utah Keanu Reeves is a former Ohio State quarterback who just graduate from academy with straight A top of his class and becomes an F.B.I. Agent who was sent in to Bank roberry devision and his assigment is to catch ExPresidents. His new partner experienced agent and Vietnam veteran Angelo Pappas Gary Busey has theory that ExPresidents are actually surfers. So Johnny agrees to go surfing and with help from a few DNK hairs. Johnny Utah founds out Quantico Beach is were the crew ExPresidents are surfing. Johnny on the beach meets Tyler Lori Petty a tough tomboy chick who can surf like a devil and is a very reluctant mentor as well. Johnny goes undercover as a lawyer and a surfer who meets through her Bodhi Patrick Swayze the charismatic leader of a gang of surfers consisting of Roach Grommet and Nathaniel. On the way there is a lot of heat action blood chases shootings skydiving football throwing a dog and more.I love the ocean the surfing scens there is no CGI the ocean the sea scens are for real. The stunts are practical they are dangerous. The sky diving is for real Swayze I think Reeves they both skydive for real I enjoy those scenes. The football scene is great executed. Utah is Chasing Bodhi and he catches him they both fly in the water great scene. The movie has tons of action. I love the fist cuffs on the end between Bodhi and Utah I love the finale. I love the fight sequence when this group of Nazi surffers attacks Johny and Bodhi comes to his rescue. I love that they both use martial arts. Patrick Swayze is excellent in martial arts. There is this great chase Johnny is chasing Ex President wearing Reagan mask leader of the gang on the gas station. Real practical action stunt effect from Keanu Reeves and his stunt double well done I don't see a shaky cam in the chase unlike in Furious 7 fight between Statham and Johnson. The foot chase is my favorite scene in the film. It is well executed Reegan throws dog on Utah but he kicks it a side that was a fake dog thank god. I love animals specially dogs so much. The fight between Utah and Reegan were actually stunt doubles fighting in the flame it was practical done you can see the camera because it shows different face of Utah.You have a great raid shootout scene in the house this guy Bunker Chris Pedersen pulls a 16 bullpup assault rifle and fiers at Pappas. Utah with his service SIGSauer pistol puts Bunker down and kills him great shoot out scene executed. War Child Vincent Klyn leader of the gang uses Sentinel Arms Striker shootgun on Utah of course Utah fires back. You have a great scene in which Utah gets attacked by a naked girl in the bathroom. Utah jumps on War Child they both fly out of the window you have great choreograph fight scene. War Child try's to stab Utah but he knocks his knive in the lawn mower. You have a great shootout scene in the bank an off duty cop pulls his service gun and starts shooting on a bank robbers and Swayze puls his Freedom Arms Model 83 revolver and kills him. Johnny Utah jumps out of an airborne plane with no parachute catches Bodhi while he's skydiving down to the desert below similar to the opening of Moonraker and holds his own revolver on him that scene was impossible they called have not talked on the air. The show Mythbusters actually tried this scenario out and it was determined that it Would have been possible for Utah to catch Bodhi from the plane within the time alotted. They actually timed it and tried it with parachutes. They also determined that the noise from the rushing air would have made it impossible for Utah and Bodhi to hold any sort of conversation. However this is a Hollywood action film  the longstanding tradition is to make the impossible possible onscreen. This is fiction action film so in movie is anything possible.Keanu Reeves's best performance as Johnny Utah he ever played his best character. Patrick Swayze is awesome as Bodhi the leader of ExPresidents I love that Bodhi is intellegent mastermind and he uses martial arts I love that. This is in my top 5 favorite Patrick Swayze movies I really miss the guy R.I.P. 1 Road House 2 Steel Dawn 3 Point Break 1991 4 Black Dog and 5 Next of Kin. Gary Busey was excellent as Angelo Pappas I love the guy I love him. He shoot and killed 2 memebers of the gang ExPresidents with his revolver Charter Arms Undercover  .38 Special and he killed a gunman who held a young woman as a hostage he shots him in the head and he save the hostage I love that. Kathryn Bigelow's best movie she is a hot lady. James Cameron in here is an executive producer he is Bigelow's ex husband. Rick King helped to wrote a story with W. Peter Iliff who later wrote an excellent screenplay for the movie. Rick King directed Kickboxer 3 The Art of War 1992. There was this guy surperior by the F.B.I. FBI Director Ben Harp played by John C. McGinley who was mean to Utah and Pappas and Pappas punched him who deserve it. The script is great I love Angelo's lines before he punches him.Point Break 1991 is one of the best action movies of all time I am defending this movie. Johnny Utah is not the worst F.BI. agent i want listen to idiots who are mocking Keanu Reeves who played the character great. Thanks to Johnny F.B.I. found the gang cause they couldn't find anything in 3 years he break the ring and the case he finished ExPresidents forever he saved his girlfrined Lori Petty good performance from the actress. This movie is not better than Heat 1995 but deserves to be right there with Heat 1995 one of the best 90's action heist movies. It is Rated R for violence language and brief nudity. I love the line I am an F.B.I Agent. Respect for my elders. I love this movie to death it is in my top 15 favorite action movies of all time.I love Nobody Rides for Free song played by Ratt on the end of the credits. I love the beautiful song Hundreds of Tears by Sheryl Crow. The only problem I have is with Bluray disc release this movie needs to be remastered we need special edition and better HD Picture quality over this years we did not got nothing. So this is my hardest review I have done before beacuse I don't watch this movie all the time. I really miss action classic movies like Point Break 1991 nowdays they don't make em like this anymore. This movie is better than The Fast and the Furious Drop Zone Terminal Velocity The Hurt Locker and Blue Steal my opinion!".

	schema:reviewBody "Katheryn Bigelow's 1991 action thriller Point Break is still a groundbreaking film of the early nineties. It tells the story of the cop John Utah Keanu Reaves hunting a bunch of bank robbers camouflaged with masks of the former U.S. presidents. His investigations leads to a group of surfers and extreme sports worshippers and the cop becomes fascinated by the freestyle philosophies and adrenaline rushes of the gang around the charismatic leader Bodhi Patrick Swayze. Their close friendship changes to a hardfought rivalry at the end when cop and gangsters face point blank.Bigelow uses typically American surf beach settings for this unusual and very stylish action thriller with great stunts like parachuting scenes bank robberies a car chase police raids martial arts breathtaking chases and brilliantly photographed surf sequences. Watch out for the Red Hot Chillie Peppers as a gang of brutal surf nazis beating up Keanu Reeves and being captured by him during a hardfought police raid.But Point Break is even more than that  it also shows the lifestyle of the nineties in many ways. Bodie and his gang are a group of New Agelike grunge guys reaching out for the most extreme adrenaline experiences. They stand for the new style of extremefun sport worshippers ravers and new spiritualists of the postyuppie era in the nineties who don't care about wealth and status symbols but for fun action breaking the limits and finding the sum of all senses. Point Break is not only a welldone example of modern action entertainment without computergenerated special effects but also a very philosophical and spiritual study of society in the nineties.".

The acting is generally good particularly Busey as a veteran FBI agent but Keanu's usual expressionless vocals and face disappoint. The script is sharp and witty. And the stunts really shine particularly the Bondstyle psycho skydiving near the end.This is in my opinion a very underrated film which deserved better from the critics.".

The acting is generally good particularly Busey as a veteran FBI agent but Keanu's usual expressionless vocals and face disappoint. The script is sharp and witty. And the stunts really shine particularly the Bondstyle psycho skydiving near the end.This is in my opinion a very underrated film which deserved better from the critics.";

	schema:reviewBody "You know those movies where there's not one realistic thing about them but it only adds to the charm and fun of it? Where the insanity and occasional inane script choices make it that much more entertaining? Point Break is such a film. It doesn't operate on any levels of reality unashamedly and wears its movie status proudly deciding instead to tell a intricate tale which is loads of fun. Kathryn Bigelow should be proud.Point Break is pure fantasy. It jams surfing action love and crime into one awesomelooking package and presents it excitedly. Everything about it is crazy. It's about an FBI agent named Johnny Utah trying to catch surfer bank robbers. You throw realism out the window upon seeing the plot summary. I mean Utah uses his real name undercover because why not? falls in love with a girl predictably barely hides his profession as an FBI agent and at one point he and the main villain know the other's true identity but still act like best buds for no reason.Keanu Reeves is at the top of his stoic emotionless game. The only actor to ever give poor performances well Reeves has made a living off of his visible lack of enthusiasm in his roles for years and it's somehow charming and endearing. He's weirdly perfect as Johnny Utah the coolest character name ever next to John McClane and Axel Foley and gives his all in the role. Patrick Swayze is excellent as the villain and it may be his finest performance. He plays a serious turd in this movie. He's cool in the beginning but you just totally hate him by the end which is the hallmark of a good villain. Gary Busey is here too lending some class and craziness as usual.Point Break is also chockfull of great action sequences. The beach fight was cool with Reeves and Swayze showing off their moves and the house raid was also welldone. The car and foot chase scene that everyone talks about is stupidly entertaining and wellshot. The bank shootout and runway shootout were cool and the plane scene was legit. The final fight was intense and brutal and very memorable. You know those movie moments where it's totally unrealistic but it's just awesome and you just smile while watching regardless of how unbelievable it is? I experienced such a moment during the second skydiving scene. Awesome.Definitely watch this 90s action classic. It has all the slowmo intense gunpoint scenes bloody squibs and fist fights you could ask for.Also this movie is not gay. I hate it when people always try to over analyze every male relationship looking for gay subtext. Every decision Keanu made with Bodhi's life was out of friendship and respect. It's not gay. Stop it. Go watch Brokeback Mountain 2005 and shut up.".

	schema:headline " One of the Most Underrated Movies of AllTime and An ActionClassic";
	schema:reviewBody "I love this movie. Every time I revisit it it reminds me of why it's one of my top 35 favorite movies of alltime. It is nonstop entertainment with an abundance of twists and turns at every corner. But it's not mindless entertainment like most action films are. In Point Break 1991 everything makes sense and therefore it is realistic. The actors all deliver outstanding performances especially considering that it technically is an action movie.What I was always impressed with the most though of this story is how it really delves into the structure of society philosophy the meaning of life through Bodhi's Swayze eyes. Call him what you will a thief a bank robber an adrenaline junky or a criminal but the man actually speaks a lot of truth into the world. Of course this doesn't justify his actions and criminality but you have to give the man some credit for being able to do the best he can to live spiritually true to himself and bring some others along for the ride into his streetwise reality.Bodhi speaks truth so well that even Keanu Reeves' Johnny Utah FBI agent can't resist it. You see Johnny really wanted to be a pro football player so whatever he is currently doing was not his top choice in life not by a long shot. So Bodhi's freespirited and funliving lifestyle wins him over. This is because Bodhi has a gift for reading people and figuring them out as well as a way to make friends with them that is realistic and irresistible I mean who doesn't love a nighttime game of tackle football on the beach beside the ocean with heavy metal blasting from the cars whose headlights help them see when they are young? Bodhi is so cultured and diversified in his interests that he is able to identify Reeves' Johnny as a former star Quarterback for I think Ohio State who blew his knee out which hindered his NFL career. But Bodhi doesn't know what Johnny did next and buys his career change into law school as a lawyer at least as first.So this dynamic sets the stage of these two becoming friends while each is suspicious of the other which creates a constant and almost perfect tension throughout the entire runtime. It's constantly entertaining how Bodhi keeps drawing Utah closer to his fun party surfing lifestyle teaching him about the spiritual side of surfing and life while you can see Utah questioning his real career change which was law enforcement. This is realistic based on Johnny's personality as a big college athlete who is being seduced by the beauty of the west coast and its' beaches and women. So many scenes consequently develop from this which are a thrill to watch.Perhaps the biggest scene is the climax when Swayze's Bodhi finds out Johnny's true new career but only because Utah catches them in the midst of a heist and chases them for miles through the streets and backyards of downtown Los Angeles. It's an extended sequence as Bodhi has just the answer kidnapping Johnny's love interest his ex who introduced them as insurance and then coerces Johnny to come on a ride along on their next bank heist where everyone gets a Presidents' mask except for Utah leaving him exposed and seemingly a willing participant in the actual robbery as they force him to go in and stand guard. From there a memorable and awesome action sequence ensues which ends with an adrenalinefilled skydiving scene.The ending is one of my favorite endings of a movie ever. It is just awesome because it stays true to the original spiritual tone the movie introduces while being adventurous unpredictable and action packed. And the way it closes with Utah literally throwing his badge away now that this case is finally complete knowing he is going to commit to surfing and living spiritually the rest of his life is just awesome in my opinion.Bodhi is a great character. This is my favorite Patrick Swayze role ever. Not only is he a charismatic intelligent leader who is cool and real but he literally lives by a set of rules throughout his criminal enterprise rules that actually make him honorable and respectable but when things go south he has to break one of them only because his friend gets shot during a robbery. When he finally breaks one only then do you actually see him as a bad guy which he definitely is.This is just a great movie. 7.3 is way too low of a score for this especially considering some of the movies rated 8 or above in the top 250. I can see some criticism since there are some corny scenes sprinkled in here and there and nitpickers might criticize something along the lines of how Utah didn't know or what he did when he found out but anything his possible he was a rookie agent after all. This is an easy 910 for me an ultimate classic that you can watch a hundred times and it never gets boring. So many great memorable lines stand out all the way through from beginning to end. It should be at least a 7.5 probably a 7.7 on here even with the large diversified audience rating it.9.510".

This woman showed more balls in this one movie than most male directors will ever have in a lifetime. The shots are bold dynamic the directing is intense and energetic  I fell in love with this film and Kathryn Bigelow the moment I saw the first shots.If you haven't already  please go watch this movie. It has aged very well  in fact I feel like it hasn't lost any of its power which in my book is a sign for an outstanding achievement. It feels as fresh as those waves it managed to capture in incredible style.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's badass bank robbery and cool surfing. But what makes this movie great is the mind game between the characters. Kudos to W. Peter Iliff for writing the movie and to Kathryn Bigelow for the direction. If you haven't seen the movie yet stop here as the rest of this review is a spoiler.If you've seen the movie take a moment to think about what's going on in the minds of the characters.Think about the scene that takes place in Johnny Utah's apartment after he failed to chase down the gang of masked bank robbers. Utah records a message to his girlfriend time passes he hears the bell comes to the door says her name opens the door and we see... the surfers themselves.That is such a great moment. First it's totally unexpected. Second we get a dejavu  it's a familiar sight  we've seen a previous scene when surfers come to Utah's apartment uninvited. Third and most importantly we immediately sense that something's wrong. After Utah witnessed them doing the last robbery why do they now show up in his apartment acting like nothing's happened? That's the awesome part. Think about what's going on in the minds of the characters  Utah knows that the surfers are the gang of bank robbers  the surfers know that Utah is an undercover FBI agent  Utah knows that the surfers know that Utah is an undercover FBI agent the surfers know that Utah knows that they are the gang of bank robbers  but Utah doesn't have a proof that the surfers are the robbers  the surfers know that Utah doesn't have a proof that they are the robbers  Utah knows that the surfers know that Utah doesn't have a proof that they are the robbersBut they engage in a mind game because they both have something to achieve Utah wants to keep hanging on with the surfers because that provides him with an opportunity to gather information where they would go in case they disappear and also gather proof that they are the bank robbers  Bodhi the leader of the surfers wants to keep hanging on with Utah because he wants to handle the situation of the undercover agent. At this point it is not revealed to the audience what Bodhi is planning to do. Bodhi is leading the game at this point and we are all pondering at how the story will unfold.And there are other important rule of the game Utah shouldn't confront the surfers with the fact that he knows that they are the bank robbers and the surfers shouldn't confront Utah with the fact that they know that he is an FBI agent. That's because the interaction may get too confrontational and unpredictable then and either party may walk away.A crucial component that makes that mind game possible is that by now a bond of mutual understanding has formed between the two main characters. So at this point IT IS RATIONAL TO BOTH UTAH AND THE SURFERS TO KEEP PLAYING THEIR ROLES AND UPHOLD THE MASQUERADE EVEN THOUGH THEY BOTH KNOW THAT BOTH SIDES ARE FAKING.THAT'S AWESOME.And the mind game gets truly spectacular when they are on the plane and about to jump out and Utah asks who packed my chute?. He knows that the surfers would benefit from him dying in an mock accident. And Bodhi understands that Utah has a rational reservation here so he offers him his chute  and even offers him to pick anybody else's chute. By doing that he's saying no killing you in a mock accident is not why I've brought you here I have something else in mind. But he doesn't have to say that. Utah understands. That's awesome.And there's the awesome moment when Utah tries to undo the spell by shouting I AM AN FBI AGENT! to the surfers. But it doesn't work  the masquerade and reality have blended by now.Everything in the movie prepares us for this. The characters are revealed step by step as we are shown that they are capable of understanding the game and willing to take the risk of participating in it  Pappas Utah's FBI partner calls the gang the most professional he has ever seen.  Bondhi is called an adrenaline junkie by his former girlfriend.  Utah's boss mentions that Utah graduated from the cadet school within the top 2  which demonstrates his ambition and intelligence  Utah tries to surf without any training  and almost drowns  which demonstrates his dedicationNone of that is accidental in a movie it's the hard work of the writer the director and everyone else involved in the film. W. Peter Iliff and Kathryn Bigelow  Google them up and remember the names.A sequel to Point Break is in the making!".

Keanu Reeves gives us a nice display of things to come in his career as this movie was released preSpeed and Matrix. Patrick Swayze gives us a nice little performance as surfing zen Bodhi. The surfing scenes are well done and so are the bank robbery pieces. Kathryn Bigelow does a good job directing this one and the rest of the cast especially Gary Busey turn in solid performances. Note the chase scene with Keanu Reeves going after a Ronald Reagan masked Swayze I'd put it in the top ten chase scenes of all times and I think most people would agree with me on that one.

	schema:reviewBody "Considered one of the most notorious boxoffice flops in history next to the 'Road to Morocco'ripoff 'Ishtar' with Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty the following year 'Howard the Duck' became the laughing stock of critics and moviegoers alike when it was released in theaters in 1986.  If its executive producer George Lucas had his way he would have canned that movie for good.  But thanks to the home video boom in the 1980s 'Howard' would follow suit and find his way into video stores across America.Nearly twenty years later 'Howard' is slowly being pulled from video store shelves.  But it is now that a film of such poor quality can be truly appreciated.Here's how it all goes down You are dropped onto a planet from a faraway universe where ducks are humanlike and are running the world only to be pulled out again moments later.  An everyday workingduck by the name of Howard gets sucked out of his living room on his recliner after returning to his apartment after a long hard day.After the opening title is shown in the thundering tradition of cinematic heavyweights like '2001 A Space Odyssey' we see Howard's decent toward the planet Earth.  Once he has reluctantly gotten his feet on the ground he clashes with the dregs of society and saves the lead singer of an allfemale punk band named Beverly played by 'Back to the Future's Lea Thompson. She tries to give him a hand and help him get an explanation as to how he got sucked out of his living room and landed in Cleveland Ohio.That explanation never actually makes any sense but that doesn't matter because better plot developments hinge upon it.  With the help of a goofy lab janitor Phil played by the immortal Tim Robbins in an early comedic role and a big time nuclear scientist Dr. Jennings none other than Jeffery Jones Howard finds out that a giant laser Jennings was using went haywire and pulled Howard down instead.  But going back isn't going to be so easy because one of Dark Overlords of Evil hitched a ride on that laser and has plans of planet domination and destruction.  And who better than to save the day than the 3'1 3'2 that is wisequacking title character Howard T. Duck!Although George Lucas got ripped apart for having his hands in this one I have yet to see a movie that is so awful so terribly bad that I have been brought to tears crying at simply recalling scenes from this flick.  The opening sequences on the duck planet contain countless parodies of American pop culture and Howard's implausible hurtle through space is enough to make even the most serious chuckle.Audiences back in 1986 didn't seem to however.  But something about watching this flop nearly two decades later makes all of these scenes so much funnier.  The way I see it our teen generation now has a funny fascination with the decade in which they were born the 80s and anything from it has a distinctive look and sound.  American pop culture was throwing away Three's Company for MTV LPs for tapes and the Bee Gees for the Brat Pack.  The youth took yet another step in distancing themselves from their parents and although they furthered that schism they too felt a strong connection the past few decades.  What was happening when I was in utero? Taking my first steps?  Saying my first words?Today's generation has 'Howard the Duck' as one of the most endangered time capsules of the 80s.  You've got a oneofakind performance by now Acadmey Award Winner Tim Robbins whose his explanation of duck's evolutionary scale is priceless.  George Lucas's own Industrial Light and Magic ILM special effects studio must be embarassed to have itself credited with the horrendous effects the Dark Overlord for one.  You've got a helplessly catchy theme song revelling in all of its cheesy 80s popsynth glory.The jokes are terrible the dialogue subpar the plot laughable.  But you know what you'll laugh you a off.Join me in saving Howard from being pulled from video store shelves. Today's generation will love the waddling fowl more than the angry moviegoers who saw this dud in the theaters.  Keep him alive!".

I've seen it a lot more.The movie has some great lead actors Jeff Jones Lea Thompson Tim Robbinsand keeps your attention from the first scene to the last. Howard is a great character. He's not only a duck out of water but also a reluctant hero that the average person can identify with. It is not boring and combines scifi  fantasy with comedy action and monster elements all rolled into one. As with many 80s movies like Back to the Future Teen Wolf Goonies etc  it is great for kids but also has jokes or situations that grownups can appreciate too. One of the great 80s movies that used lots of practical special effects. Very young kids might be frightened by some of the monster elements near the end but it should be fine for ages 8 and over. Like I said it is definitely worth one watch  for Lea Thompson in her underwear  if nothing else which caused what I believe was my first boner.".

And that's one of the things that makes it so fascinatingyou just sit there wondering what on earth the man was thinking.I'm not going to write this with any intent of sarcastically ripping it to shreds though. I'm going to attempt to both be fair and to express my opinion of it at the same time mainly because I know that there are some folks out there who enjoy it for various reasons.I'll be honest with you the moment I heard Lucas was doing this film months in advance and even then I was convinced the guy telling me was kidding until I saw an article for it in the paper I rolled my eyes with disgust and didn't see it in the theatres. I saw it when a friend later rented it out of curiosity after it was rushed to video.So what was it that suddenly possessed me to watch it? Well I found out that my cousin was in it. You see my cousin's name is Debbie Carrington a.k.a. Debbie Lee Carrington who was an Ewok in RETURN OF THE JEDI as well as a slew of other things including but not limited to MEN IN BLACK CAPTAIN EO TOTAL RECALL where she got to get on a table in a blonde wig and blast people with a machine gun and on THE DREW CAREY SHOW MiniMimi. So naturally I wanted to see this one because I learned of her involvement in it after the fact.Most people loathe this film but some like it simply because it's so weird in its badness while others genuinely love it for whatever reason. And that's okay. Actually I kind of got a kick out of it and all its silliness the first time I saw it. We tried to watch it a second time though and were bored by it half the way through.I just now saw it again for the first time since then.One of the most bizarre things about this movie is how cheap it looks. For all the gobs of cash wasted on it a record sum HOWARD THE DUCK looks terrible. And no I'm not talking about just the duck costume I'm talking about the overall film which looks exactly like a lowbudget special made for television. Seriously that's exactly how it looks and I have no clue as to where the budget went to. I once wondered if it was used to desperately convince the stars involved to be in it but I doubt it.And meanwhile... speaking of the stars I've got to hand it to Lea Thompson. Despite all the oddness here and all the stuff she is asked to do she handles it all like a real trooper. In fact this may be the bravest performance she's ever done especially the bed scene. It also apparently didn't kill her career thank God. Even though her character isn't at all fitting for a Big City Punkette critics have nevertheless pointed out that she's still appealing here in her role as Beverly and I agree. Meanwhile Jeffery Jones gives quite possibly the strangest performance he's ever done which is also an oddly effective one.The biggest problem with the film is its mechanically coy selfconscious script that has commercialized to death all of the original comic's appeal out of the final result so what ELSE is new Hollywood?  . The movie can't decide whether it wants to follow the original concept or sweeten it up to supposedly appeal to a wider audience and it is badly confused as a result. The movie desperately wants to protect its investment so much so that the life has been choked out of it. Also it has a huge amount of blah unimaginatively generic lines No more Mr. Nice Duck You'll never get away with this etc..But these days it does have a ridiculous kind of flaky charm partially because it's such an unbelievable antiachievement and because it's so incredibly Eighties that it serves as a strong time capsule. And for those reasons and more HOWARD THE DUCK has earned a place in twentieth century culture.".

This movie isn't as bas as some people make it out to be but that's not to say that it doesn't have potential.";

	schema:reviewBody "Howard the Duck is a film that I grew up with I was only a 1 year old when it was released but my mom and I would watch it together all the time. I think that's the reason why this movie is just special to me. But still I watch this movie and honestly it's not as bad as most people exaggerate it to be granted it's not Citizen Kane but it's still awesome to watch. I think people take the movie too seriously first off look at the title if you're expecting a duck to deliver an Oscar worth performance get your head checked second people make fun of the flirting between the duck and Lea Thompson which was meant to be a joke not real. Third the ending people make fun of it and it's being over the top I personally found it to be so funny and still a ton of fun to watch how could you not get a kick out of Jeffrey Jones' performance? He was awesome! If you wanna know what the movie is about read on before you see the movie so you can get a good idea and judge for yourself.The film begins late at night in Duckworld which is a version of planet Earth but with talking ducks living there in place of human beings. As Howard tries to relax his armchair begins to vibrate violently and Howard and the chair are promptly yanked through outerspace all the way to Cleveland on planet Earth. After ending up in an oil drum Howard hears a fight involving a woman and two thugs pretending to be her fans. Howard uses his skills of Quack Fu to defend her. Intimidated by a talking duck the thugs scamper. The woman Beverly thanks Howard and feeling sorry for him because he has no warm and dry place to sleep invites him to her apartment. The next day Beverly takes Howard to see Phil Blumburtt  who she believes is a scientist that can help Howard get back to Duckworld. It turns out Phil is actually a janitor at a museum and Howard infuriated with Phil's charade. A few days later Dr. Walter Jenning  and Larry who explain to Howard that they were doing a routine procedure at the lab only for the experiment to go out of control causing the laser to hit Howard's planet instead. Howard suggests he can be sent back to Duckworld if the laser can be put into reverse. He is taken to the Dynatechnics lab alongside Beverly only to find out on arrival that the laser is seriously damaged due to another explosion. The explosion brings down a Dark Overlord who is not seen by the audience at the time and takes over Jenning's body. Howard and Beverly see Dr. Jenning but he is in the process of being taken over by the Dark Overlord. With Howard and Beverly both unaware of this they escape in Jenning's car onto the freeway with him driving dangerously due to his worsening possession. They stop outside a diner just before he is fully taken over. Inside the Diner the Overlord explains his attempts to call forth his fellow aliens from the Nexus of Sominus so that they may take over the world.Honestly yeah the plot is a bit much to grasp but cut the movie some slack it's about a duck for goodness' sake! For me it still makes me laugh and I have a ton of fun watching it. I loved seeing Tim Robbins and Howard trying to get to the factory to destroy Jeffrey Jones before he could take over the world Tim was absolutely hilarious! Yes there are a few things about this movie that are over the top but I still think that this movie is just mindless entertainment. Hey how many movies do we have where a duck saves Planet Earth? Hmm I guess this is the only one but give the movie a fair chance it's a cute one.710".

The film was written by Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz who cowrote American Graffiti and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and directed by Huyck with special effects by ILM. What could go wrong?A lot apparently. Howard was a critical and financial failure that deepsixed the careers of Huyck and Katz and led to the cancellation of the duck's magazine. If the film had a moderately priced budget it might have been forgotten as just another lightweight trashy 1980s comedy and even turned a profit. Instead the budget somehow ballooned to a then staggering 37000000 almost as much as the entire Star Wars trilogy cost to make. Although other films lost more money and got worse reviews the name Howard the Duck is still synonymous with expensive turkey.That said the movie itself isn't as bad as it's reputation suggests. The plot revolves around the title character voice by Chip Zien played by various midgets in animatronic duck suits a sarcastic talking duck from a planet a lot like Earth except ducks evolved into the dominant life form. Howard is brought to Cleveland Ohio when an experimental laser beam opens an interdimensional portal. There he befriends an aspiring rock singer Leah Thompson and a kooky lab assistant Tim Robbins and comes into conflict with various lowlifes the police and an evil demon that has possessed the body of a helpful scientist Jeffrey Jones all the while trying to get back home.Gerber's original comic book series and a subsequent adultoriented magazine weren't kids' stuff. They juxtaposed a funny animal character with bizarre villains and action more typical of Marvel's superhero books usually parodying comics politics and popular culture in the process. A sexual relationship between Howard and his human girlfriend Beverly was more than just implied. The Howard the Duck movie could have either toned down the more adult situations to create a familyfriendly actioncomedy or gone straight for ribald satire and gotten an R rating. Instead the filmmakers sought an uncomfortable middle ground that pleases no one. The script is not witty enough for adults and it is too sleazy and scary for young children. The endless duck puns become tiresome. There are however a few truly funny moments such as Howard's shock at being served eggs or his observation that If God intended ducks to fly he wouldn't have taken away our wings.The direction is uneven. The reaction of several characters to meeting a talking alien duck seems muted given the circumstances. The special effects are also hit and miss. The animatronic duck suit cost millions but the actors inside it add little personality. They could have at least waddled when they walked. The demonic Dark Lords of the Universe at the end of the film are portrayed with stop motion animation that is jerky and unrealistic even for the time perhaps this was intentional though to provide a Bmovie feel.
