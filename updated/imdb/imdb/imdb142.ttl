	schema:reviewBody "One of my favorite childhood memories of all time the live action Jungle Book in 1967 we had a classic animated movie of the same title it's a great movie has fun music and terrific characters. When my family bought the movie The Jungle Book I don't think they realized the surprise that we got when we just enjoyed watching this film. It's strange because this is made a little more for the grown up crowd vs. the children but still I absolutely loved The Jungle Book and every time I see it I admire it a little more for different reasons. The story the setting the actors I don't know what it was about this film that I just love so much but it holds a special place in my heart.In the Victorian period Mowgli is the fiveyearold son of a wilderness guide who accompanies his father on a hunting trip in the jungles of their native India. Mowgli becomes close friends with a British girl named Kitty Brydon whose father Colonel Geoffrey Brydon commissioned the hunt. When Shere Khan attacks the camp and kills Mowgli's father the boy and the wolf are lost in the confusion and are left to fend for themselves. Bagheera finds them and leads Mowgli to the wolf pack. Mowgli is befriended by the animals of the jungle including Baloo the bear cub and they develop an unspoken bond as the growing boy learns to survive. While in the wild the BanderLog steal the bracelet Kitty gave him. Years later after growing to adulthood Mowgli once again encounters Kitty who still lives in India with her father and her arrogant and deceitful suitor Captain William Boone. Kitty and Mowgli recognize each other and while his powers of speech are rusty Kitty reintroduces Mowgli to civilization with the help of Dr. Julius Plumford and Mowgli introduces Kitty to his friends in the jungle. However after spending most of his life in the jungle Mowgli does not feel at home among the rude and snobbish aristocrats who are friends with Kitty's family. He falls in love with Kitty but wants to go back to the jungle and to be with his real family.The Jungle Book is an incredibly good movie that I highly recommend. It has great laughs like watching Mowgli learning how to becoming civilized in society with the help of Dr. Plumford and seeing how Plumford is also trying to learn from Mowgli how to be in touch with nature. I loved to love story between Mowgli and Kitty it was so lovely and their kiss was one of those sappy moments that got a big Awww!!! from me. Then there's one of the saddest movie moments ever when Baloo gets shot and Mowgli finds him and just lies with him crying then Dr. Plumford reveals Baloo at the end of the movie and I cry in joy they had me on so many rollar coaster rides of emotions. But seriously if you haven't seen this movie I would recommend it very much it's a very special film and deserves more recognition.1010".

It features an excellent cast headed by Jason Scott Lee Lena Headey Sam Neill and John Cleese all giving admirable performances.Detailed scenic wonders of the jungle with dense foliage rippling waterfalls exotic plants and animalsand best of all the majestic looking sets for the hidden city holding all the treasures are what make the film worth watching. The famous story has its share of jungle thrills and these have been broadened to include even more conflict in the jealousy that evolves between Mowgli and a British officer who wants to marry the girl. His only interest in Mowgli is to have him lead him to the hidden city. As the boy who finds out that Civilization can be more dangerous than any jungle Jason Scott Lee is the perfect embodiment of Mowgli capturing the character's innocence and naive nature in a way that is always credible. Lena Headey makes a lovely heroine as the girl he knew as a youngster who befriends him again against the opposition of her arrogant British officer fianc Cary Elwes whose untimely end makes for one of the story's most exciting and satisfying scenes.Background music by Basil Pouledoris is highly effective and Stephen Sommers directs the whole piece in workmanlike fashion with only a few scenes a bit too intense for young children.Summing up An adventurous tale well told in a gorgeously mounted production.".

Mowgli his pet wolfcub and the rescued bearcub Balu follow the panther through the jungle and I went with them. Every actor modulates his or her performance to make the story happen to balance the telling.  Kitty Mowgli's childhood friend does not let one drop of saccharine spoil her natural young woman.  Cary Elwes as a villain is frighteningly archetypal just as he is a beautiful hero in other films. . . But the animal actors are what compel me to fork over dollars for my own copy of the video.  Since they are surrounded by masterful cinema storytelling and heartfelt human performances their work carries the main theme of this film. We know now how fragile the jungle and its inhabitants are as man approaches with guns and bulldozers.  The delicate balance of man and animal the diplomacy of Mowgli at times the essence of courage and loyalty  all this is portrayed. If you know the original Jungle Book and the moral spirit of its author you recognize that the character of the jungle inhabitants is respected.  In this film while we are given an adventure extrapolated from the original literary situation the Law of the Jungle is kept.  For sophisticated Kipling see the Michael CaineSean Connery film The Man Who Would Be King.".

	schema:reviewBody "Interested in seeing an action packed movie? If so watch The Jungle Book live version. I really enjoyed it. This movie has so much action and suspense and follows the same storyline as the cartoon version but with so much more detail. The movie is about a boy named Mowgli who is taken away from his village after a tiger attack. He gets stuck on a runaway wagon that is on fire. After he manages to get off of the wagon he is too far away from his village and no one can find him. Mowgli is raised by a pack of wolves and grows up with a panther and a bear named Baloo. Eventually he is found by civilization and his childhood love named Kitty. He then has to learn how to fit in with everyone. My favorite character in the movie is Mowgli because he tries really hard to fit in with everyone once he is found. He also tries really hard to always protect Kitty. He is a really good fighter and climber. My favorite part in this movie is when Mowgli finds a secret hideout where a lot of monkeys live. It is packed with mountains of treasures. He finds a dagger but then a snake pops out and tries to kill Mowgli. So Mowgli fights with the snake and eventually uses the dagger to kill the snake. It is really suspenseful. I recommend this movie for ages 6 and up. Younger kids might get scared watching this movie because there is a lot of fighting and suspense. Credit Anthony Aranda age 9 KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'd better start off saying how much I love the 1967 animated film. I just loved how original funny and lighthearted it all was. This film doesn't quite have the charm of the 1967 film and there are some parts like the animal mauling that I found rather intense. Wilkin's death comes to mind. But there is so much that compensates it is actually truer to the book than the 1967 film was and it is definitely worthwhile. I also think it is very underrated the look of the film and the music should've at least guaranteed a 7.0 rating on IMDb and whether I bring this film up to people the general impression is that athey haven't seen it bit is inferior to the 1967 film or cthey hate it full stop. I admit it I do prefer the animation as I grew up with it but I really like this version as well. The animals are very well trained I liked how wise Baloo was and Shere Kahn gave a good amount of menace whenever he was on screen. The film looks absolutely stunning the cinematography is striking the forests are lush and the waterfalls are sparkling. The costumes are fabulous Kitty's dresses are to die for and Lena Headey I must say looked gorgeous. The music from Basil Pouledoris who also composed the music for the Hunt For Red October is sweeping and rousing and the pace and direction are slick. The performances are fine too Jason Scott Lee is likable as Mowgli John Cleese is wonderfully benevolent as Dr Plumford and Cary Elwes makes a suave handsome and charismatic villain. In conclusion very good and underrated film. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:headline " Boys young  old like adventure yarns and this is a good one!";
	schema:reviewBody "What a rollicking adventure story this film is  straight from the pages of Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Books and as uncomplicated as any schoolboy adventure yarn.  It's really about the laws of man and the laws of the jungle and the divergence of opinions which continue even today.  Most of the humans in this film are depicted as tiresome bores courageous only when their finger is on the trigger of a rifle. The animals of the jungle seem to be the most maligned but somehow get the upper hand.  After all the jungle is their territory.  The film gives some hope for the future when Mowgli reared by wild animals and Kitty a sweet English girl fall in love.  The athletic Mowgli with the agility of a leopard in his jungle home is forced to lead a party of soldiers to the monkey palace where untold treasure has been accumulated.  It's a difficult trek but greed drives them on to the secret place.  Action hots up as the animals fight back to preserve their territory.  Kitty's life is threatened many times but handsome Mowgli with his animal instincts is able to save her. A touching scene in the film and one of the quieter moments is Mowgli's discovery of a room in which the heads of hunted animals are stuffed and mounted as trophies on the walls. Without being too cynical I must say that Mowgli is surprisingly adaptable as Kitty makes attempts to civilize him and teach him to dance.  He is certainly a quick learner. But the English aristocracy do not accept him. If one can believe all that Kipling portrays one feels his heart lies in the jungle which he trekked through himself during his travels in Africa. Maybe his attitude to the jungle is overromanticized but the resulting film adds up to great family entertainment.  With regard to the monkey palace it is truly a wonder to behold.  The technological experts have done a great job in managing the special effects.  They defy analysis.  Better to just sit back and enjoy each exciting moment.".

	schema:headline " Why so Low IMDb?";
	schema:reviewBody "I am shocked at the low rating this movie has. Sure the animated version will forever be my favorite. But I felt that Disney did a fine job bringing an animated movie and novel to life. Jason Scott Lee stars as Mowgli and does Rudyard Kipling proud by making the audience believe he can talk to animals. The animals that were featured in this version were great from the wolf to the great Tiger. The story starts out with a hunting expedition in India led by Mowgli's father. As a boy Mowgli meets and takes a liking to the daughter of the British colonel who financed the trip played by the great Sam Neill. While they camp at night a powerful and fierce tiger attacks the camp killing several people including Mowgli's father. Mowgli ends up being separated from the camp and is presumed dead by everyone. In the jungle he meats a baby bear and wolf and together they grow up. Eventually Mowgli comes across his long lost love but even though he is accepted to society he feels like an alien. If that's not enough he must battle a corrupt army captain who has his sights on Mowgli's love. Ultimately this is a film that is worthy to have The Jungle Book as it title with great acting and beautiful scenery. Truly a film that everyone can enjoy.".

But I felt that Disney did a fine job bringing an animated movie and novel to life. Jason Scott Lee stars as Mowgli and does Rudyard Kipling proud by making the audience believe he can talk to animals. The animals that were featured in this version were great from the wolf to the great Tiger. The story starts out with a hunting expedition in India led by Mowgli's father.

	schema:reviewBody "These are the spoilersWhat an interesting piece of film here. Alright well I'll give my two cents here. It starts out with Mowgli a young Indian boy bonding with a young British girl named Catherine who like he lost her mother when she was a baby. Things go wrong and Mowgli's father is mauled by a tiger Mowgli himself being cast into and lost in the jungle. He bonds with the animals and loses himself to it effectively becoming a savage and donning a loincloth to boot.Years later he finds a hidden city in the jungle and a massive treasure. But when he tries to get back Catherine's bracelet he is attacked by a huge snake. After a desperate and losing struggle he barely escapes the vicious reptile with his life and the bracelet. The next day we see Catherine who has developed into a beautiful and intelligent young woman opposite Mowgli's cumbersome and illiterate character. They meet and Catherine flees into the arms of her fianc Captain William Boone who along with his friends proceeds to fight Mowgli which results in Mowgli being shot in the arm.Mowgli tries to meet Catherine in the British fort but he is beaten down and captured. Over the rest of the course of the film Catherine her doctor and her father attempt to teach Mowgli to read and speak proper English which they succeed in to some degree. But ultimately the jungle boy answers the 'call of the wild' and returns but Boone wants the treasure he found. Along with his buddies William tracks down Mowgli and forces him to lead him to the treasure. Once there he attempts to kill Mowgli and nearly kills the savage but is killed by the same snake that attacked Mowgli earlier. Mowgli and Catherine fall in love the end.Spoilers end hereVery interesting. There were some things about it that are obviously intended for older audiences. Throughout most of the movie Mowgli wears nothing more than a loincloth rendering him effectively naked for the majority of the movie while his enemies wear full clothing. Obviously not intended for kids. In one sequence he is seen fighting a large and fully clothed man atop a cliff nearly being beaten off the edge. I even wonder if there wasn't some grounds for a racist argument in there. In the final sequence Mowgli a naked Indian man was attacked by William a fullyclothed British man and stumbled clumsily around to avoid William's deadly swordplay. I won't point fingers but it's there.Anyway good movie if you like watching naked people get shot at and beaten around by notnaked people. Nah it's a good film and you should watch it if you're over 9 I would say. 8 out of 10.".

While the cartoon follows the adventures of the boy Mowgli surrounded by animals who think and speak as human beings the feature film shows the adult Mowgli and the animals are real animals without attributing human traits and Mowgli communicates with them in their languages. I'm a bit surprised by the amount and the explicitity of violence injury and death since this is a Disney movie which means it is primarily intended for children. Camera that zooms a man drowning and finally dying in quicksand isn't exactly a sight suitable for children. Jason Scott Lee is visually perfect choice and has played a great role. Of the more famous there are Cersei Lannister and John Cleese but the animals carry main role and the charm of this film. About 200 trained wild animals were used. For tiger scenes only the most indispensable staff remained on the set and the blue screen was used but many scenes with wildlife are completely authentic which leaves a stronger impression than the best CGI. Although it tells another story the film retains Kipling's spirit and respects the law of the jungle You can kill only to eat or to avoid being eaten.810Mowgli Then do you eat him?Boone  No of course not.M Does he want to eat you?B Why no.M Then why kill him?B Because he is your enemy.M What is enemy?B Someone you hate.M What is hate?".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite diverging in many ways from Kipling's classic novel I love this film and feel that it holds up well since when I was a child. It's been almost ten years since I last saw it and my affection for it hasn't declined. I cannot fathom why Disney hasn't attempted to revive it for a new release. It truly deserves more love.One night in the jungles of India Shere Khan the tiger attacks a convoy of soldiers of the British Empire whom Mowgli and his father were guiding. As a boy Mowgli is smitten by the Colonel's young daughter Kitty. In the chaos Mowgli and his wolf cub Grey Brother are separated from the convoy and his father killed by the tiger and lost in the jungle. Bagheera the panther discovers the pair and leads them to the wolf pack where they are adopted as members of the pack. Mowgli also adopts a young Baloo as his brother. Mowgli grows up in the jungle and discovers his childhood sweetheart Kitty wandering through the jungle accompanied by her suitor Captain William Boone. Mowgli follows her back to the British fort and his captured by Boone but is freed on Kitty's request and is taught by her and Dr Plumford the power of speech and the ways of civilization and Mowgli begins to fall in love with her over time. Captain Boone learns from Mowgli of the location of the lost Monkey City and its treasure within. Unable to adjust to life amidst the British aristocracy and saddened by Boone's proposal to Kitty Mowgli returns to the jungle. However Boone hatches a plan to lure Mowgli back to lead them to the lost city.Famous Kipling elements such as the Law of the Jungle the red flower as a symbol for fire and an affinity for nature are carried over which I believe makes it more genuine. Jason Scott Lee is emotive innocent and sincere as Mowgli and while I'm aware he's not Indian I feel his performance solidifies his place in the role he truly feels closer in spirit to Kipling than the animated Mowgli though I do very much like the animated film. Lena Headey is very likable as Kitty and has great chemistry with Jason Cary Elwes is sinister and callous as the traitorous Boone and Sam Neill and John Cleese both add humour and quintessential British charm to the film especially Cleese in his interactions with Mowgli.As any good film should I was swept up in the action emotions and characters and being an animal lover I always rooted for Mowgli and his friends. While I was scared as a child at first I still revisited for it's adventurous spirit and rewarding ending. I'd even go so far to say as this is Stephen Sommers' best film balancing the more sentimental scenes with serious action and tension very nicely. The animal training is flawless Shere Khan is an appropriately menacing force of nature Grey Brother Baloo and Bagheera are warm benevolent brothers to Mowgli and King Louie steals the show whenever he's on screen. The jungle and fort locations have a rich atmosphere and provide some beautiful visual elements benefitting from actual location scouting in India. Basil Poledouris provides a romantic and exciting score that honestly deserves more attention underlining the action scenes and moments of affection between Mowgli and Kitty. At 1 hour 50 minutes it feels very nicely paced and manages to keep investment going.My real problem with the movie is that truth be told this isn't really Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book as the title would suggest. It can be too violent for a younger audience at times with the villains Shere Khan Kaa and the traps within the temple and there are some instances of mild profanity but nothing I was especially disturbed by. And I suppose some people may be put off due to the fact that Sommers borrowed more from Tarzan with Kitty as Jane and Indiana Jones with the human villains temple and treasure as opposed to Kipling that the movie's core concept does feel less original and the performances are just generally good enough to carry the story. Arguably its the best live action Tarzan film to date only with an Indian setting but it still pulls it off very effectively. Because of that same adventurous style engaging visuals romantic score and likable animal and human characters I still rate 1994's 'The Jungle Book' very highly and intend to watch it again soon.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a good take on Kipling's masterpiece and I liked it more ! than the cartoon version.  David Sommers did a great job on it I always wanted to see Mowgli grown up.  Mind you he's a fast learner.  First he sees Kitty then he starts a riot goes to prison gets discovered and learns how to talk.  It happens to fast.  But that's the movies for you and you can't really fault that.There are a lot of cool moments in the movie like in the beginning when Kitty gives Mowgli her bracelet in his...reentry into the human race when he sees all the animal heads in a room and you can feel this weird...presence.  It's kind of beautiful kind of sad and very very Kipling.  He would have liked it I think.".

	schema:headline " A little weak for a while but then it improves and turns out to be a captivating adventure movie overall";
	schema:reviewBody "27 years after the release of the famous animated Disney feature The Jungle Book a live action Disney movie with the same title came into theatres. Both films feature characters from Rudyard Kipling's book of the same name which I have never read. I think it was on the last week of 1994 in between Christmas and New Year's when I went to see this live action version in the theatre. I was eight years old and can't remember exactly what I thought but certainly don't recall finding it boring. Shortly after that I remember seeing at least a bit of it again at school but don't recall seeing any of it after that until last night when I saw it for the first time in well over a decade. It looked mildly disappointing at first but didn't stay that way.Set in Victorianera India five year old Mowgli goes on a hunting expedition with his father in the jungles of India and quickly befriends Katherine Kitty Brydon the five year old daughter of English colonel Geoffrey Brydon. After a tiger named Shere Khan kills Mowgli's father the little boy finds himself lost in the jungle and is raised by animals. He grows up here living like the jungle animals and learning how to communicate with them. One day Kitty happens to be in the jungle again and Mowgli sees her which lures him back to the village where his childhood friend still lives with her father. Kitty and Dr. Julien Plumford begin to reintroduce him to human life and teach him English and Mowgli shows Kitty what life is like in the jungle. While these two are nice to him there are other British colonists who look down on him including Kitty's arrogant suitor Captain William Boone. Mowgli is also disgusted when he learns about human laws.Around the beginning when Mowgli and Kitty are five years old it gets pretty sappy between the two. The musical score is really overdone in some scenes such as the one where Mowgli discovers Monkey City and often gets too sappy in the romantic scenes. There are several groinkicking scenes which are unnecessary especially for a family movie. Despite the severe flaws however there's more good than bad. Jason Scott Lee does a very nice job playing the likable lead and the acting in general is good here including memorable performances from Lena Headey as Kitty and John Cleese as Dr. Plumford. The humour in this film is never hilarious but is sometimes at least mildly amusing such as the part where Dr. Plumford says No. That's not a boat. That's Queen Victoria. I think casting a former Monty Python comedian Cleese in the movie helped. The adventure often gets exciting very much so later on and there are touching moments as well. One particularly heartwrenching scene is Mowgli finding Baloo severely injured. This is a scene I clearly remember from my first viewing! Even though the 1967 and 1994 films have the same title and several of the same characters and they are both from Disney one being animated and the other live action is not the only major difference. The plot is a little different and this film is significantly darker than the cartoon version. There are live action movies with talking animals such as the hit 1995 family film Babe but this is not one of them. I'm not saying this is a good or bad thing but it is another notable difference between these two Disney flicks. However despite being very different both films are good. One of the reasons for the PG rating of this version is the violence which occasionally includes some fairly gory scenes. I wouldn't recommend this film for kids much younger than I was during its theatrical run but for older kids and others who like adventure movies this COULD be entertaining. It's no masterpiece but it is fairly underrated.".
